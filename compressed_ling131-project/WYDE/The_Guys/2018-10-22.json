I'm going about there's ... there's maybe one statistic from like twenty twelve that's pushed in there to try to drive 'em a narrative point but other than that I don't think there's any\nI wouldn't say they're statistics per se but\n[laughter]\nSome things are more generalized\n\nThere are statistics per se but [laughter]\n\nSome things are more generalized\n\n... kind of just known societal norms that was so condescending I'm not going to say there's to his the spurs [laughter]\n[laughter]\nAll right I'm going to go with or we put money on this Monday I'm as I'm saying one statistic\nTo validate a mute point where the door the data doesn't even validate the point you're going to say there's just generalizations backed by some scientific generalizations\nYeah let's go at that okay we put money on it you've already read articles on now\nThat's not the point though [laughter]\nA portrait far far more mummy nine thirty three All right pretty much everywhere in the world this is true women experienced sexual violence and the threat of violence that permeates our choices\nAnd small so I'm going to be honest here's what's being done here\nAnd I'm going to catch a lot of flak for saying this but when you start your argument with this I think it's an attempt to have nobody be able to critique it\nBecause if we're being honest is sexual violence they problem yes it's sexual assault a problem yes have those numbers dropped since the Nineteen sixties\nHad this to to have the number of sexual assaults since the Nineteen sixties dropped in in this country in the United states yes but we're going to move forward with this point\nAnd we're going to use this point as a way to stifle conversation because when you leave with this if you argue with somebody saying we need to do something about sexual assault what are you like deal and if you said we needed to do something to stop sexual assault\nAnd I said no no no and then any everybody tune me out after saying no no no and it doesn't matter if I said that's not the point after it\n... what's ... what is going to be your perception\n\nThis is not a difficult question I mean that's basically just people being intolerant of what your opinion is\nNo no no but if I'm if you ... if you say we need to stop sexual assaults and all you hear me say is no no no I Am I not the biggest jerk on the planet right just by that definition\nSure okay that's what I think he's trying to happen here is she's leading with sexual assaults in order to say look I'm going to lead with the so nobody can argue with it so regardless about what I say for the rest of the article somebody's got a point to that and you're saying so you don't believe that we should stop sexual assaults\nSaid that\nI never said that and who's to say that all sexual assaults that happened happened against women they don't as a majority against women yeah are there still some that are happening against men yeah if gender is on the spectrum are there still some that happen to people that don't identify as ... as a man or woman\nYeah\nWhat am I allowed to say no no no no [noise] pretty much everywhere in the world this is true women experienced sexual violence and the threat of that violence permeates our choices big and small still not a fact anywhere in this in this in addition\nMales violence is not restricted to intimate partner attacks or sexual assault but plagues us in the form of terrorism and mass gun violence\nSo based on that sentence what if you stop at the butt and just take the first half of the Senate ... that's an over generalized statement that it's somewhat true [noise]\nAnd just take the first half of the ... that's an over generalized statement that is somewhat true\nIn addition to male ... male violence okay so I'm going to get the in addition so the statement is male violence is not restricted to intimate partner attacks or sexual assault well no ... I Can't say what I Want to say\nNeither is female violence\nFemale violence is not restricted to intimate partner attacked or sexual assault take any superficial characteristic of your being\nRight and put it in that category any one facet of your being white violence is not restricted to intimate partner attacks or sexual assault Christian violence is not restricted to intimate partner attacks or sexual assault do I need to continue\nOver generalized over generalized huge but this is the fact doing this is the fact she's bringing to bear don't forget that\nBut plagues us in the ... and the second part of the sentence makes me go well there's a left turn I feel like we were just going we were talking about sexual assault oh terrorism and gun violence how did we get here well don't know but plagues us in the form of terrorism and the mass gun violence\nYou think she provides some validation for this right\nNow remember that sentence and go into the next one\nThat's what I'm saying so she says in addition males violence is not restricted the intimate partner attacks or sexual assault but plagues us in the form of terrorism and mass gun violence so she should validate that right she's going to say male viola I'm Shirley\nManifest itself in shootings and terrorism at least validate that a little bit then she says in the next sentence women are underrepresented in higher wage jobs local and federal government business educational leadership et cetera\nWhat\nWhere is the validation come on I'm not saying I disagree with you I Am saying you're making a huge over generalization but I'm not saying I disagree with you but if you're going to make a point at least validated that's like me coming out and go on a bill in how you doing just what\nMen they lie\nOh you're going to prove that it all got we are we going to talk about people that have lived throughout history that are ... no middle I let's continue\nOr are you kidding me [noise] women are underrepresented in higher wage jobs local and federal government business educational leadership et cetera which means I ran out of the CNN ... talking points so I'm just going to put et cetera wage inequality continues to permeate\nEvery economy and almost every industry women continue to provide far higher rates of unpaid labor in the home childcare elder care care for disabled individual housework and food provisions women have less access to as you get no no no no no no no no no if we're talking about the United\nStates and this is not true categorically not true women dominate higher education women\nDominate Ivy League education women dominate the medical field the statistics come to bear on this so if you're going to say in the United states women have less access to education you're full uh like you're just not true what you're saying is not true\nBut all of this is pointing to this dark disparity that we always talked about and that is the difference between\nTrue but all of this is pointing to this dark disparity that we always talk about and that is the difference between equality of opportunity and a quality of outcome equality of outcome is a socialistic principal and here and\nWe're having somebody advocate for a socialistic principle of a quality of outcome because you want me to you want me to answer all this higher wage jobs in the United states you enter into good central contract if you don't like what you're being paid you can quit or negotiate for higher contract local and federal government\nThat is just a basic hiring process again it can central contract business again a consensual contract and it's just again the she ran out of talking points so after she said higher wage jobs then she put business underneath it so again that's just not true educational leadership held\nIs that even referring to an wage inequality so what she said three times and this is wage inequality and let me tell you almost four times arguably let me tell you when you\nEnter into a contract with an employer it's consensual if you don't like what you're getting paid don't take the job right when\nYou enter into that job you decide what you're going to be paid it's a choice we do not have the quality of outcome in this country we do have a quality of upper unity\nAre they got there I Want to make sure we got it done right\n[laughter] well your bedroom and I am Baird prejudge rather All right sorry it all the other phone calls murder fussy you I'm Sorry we're never thought about the moral I'll give you all for five minutes whatever you want to talk about more but\nI got a little too heated so little to fetus\nAnd how to deal with office but guess what if you don't want to fall afraid of the city ... if you want to keep your mind and body healthy and well go check out my friends over ...

Arizona Center\nYou know home moms are nothing but leach is what according to the Democratic candidate and Arizona Senate race yeah\nThey do or go out of their way to make friends nothing\n...\nYeah Kristin cinema yeah rounds with another word OK you there okay what\nElse yeah there's a new virus going around those giving kids polio like symptoms\nYeah all that\nYou know eighty seven cases so far in the CDC's working on vaccines for it and it is not polio yeah it's a completely different virus they just give symptoms like polio\nSo the people who want to go beat the snot out all the anti of actors just chill out please snack sphere of say\nWell you know kind of going back to ... yesterday it was kind of a metaphor for a lot of what's going on in in this country in terms of\nThe mob mentality and it really is getting out of control and not just politically I I Am beginning to realize that people are not responding so much to the Trump Administration or policy or are they growing caravan that we have in front of us\nBut whenever you have large groups of people and I got to find large by you know four or five groups of people that are\nEmotional about anything\nIt gets completely out of control I mean it's a fight yesterday\nJust the whole parking situation and I'm watching these people completely unravel over this lottery ... there's no chance that they're going to win at all you know we did it just for something to do just that they could drive and spent some time together and get in the car and take God on you know a little road trip with us\nBut you know as I'm looking at some of the other stories that are out there whether or not it would be the story about Mitch McConnell trying to have dinner with his wife of all people and then you know what's going on with ... and the story after story act and then of course you know you've got the uh second wave of immigrants coming up from Honduras which is growing as well\nI Do not know I Can't remember a time\nAnd I'm I'm I'm sure they've been there but I still can't remember a time when you had this this this environment in this country\nWhere it seemed to be the mobs were rolling everything so I kinda wonder is all the the arrangement about Trump because of Trump what the other was which came first the Trump or the arrangement and I'm starting to think is the arrangement\nI agree with you on that one because if you look at it even before Trump you had it ... not the one that triggered it it's been out there for years ages\nYeah if you will yeah there's always been a mob mentality when circles around politics or anything that people get passionate yeah\nWell you know you start getting your emotion into it and then over the weekend when I when I wasn't driving you know spend time with my Twitter feed and of course I see a lot of the other stuff is floating around out there\nAnd you know there was a couple of things on there about women breastfeeding and uh you know what's going on in the election the caravan of course we're back to what about the babies and and I'm just I'm reading some of this stuff and I'm going man there's a ... I don't have\nEnough time to get stuff done that I Want to get done I'm trying to launch this podcast for the book\nOn Tuesday and frankly it's probably going to be a little later in the week because the more I get into this whether or not you know we're hanging new fixtures or were raised in four hours to go to Georgia back or five whatever it was or whatever the case may be when I when I wake up in the morning and I started thinking about the things\nOr you know were raised in four hours to go to Georgia back or five whatever it was or whatever the case may be\nWhen I when I wake up in the morning and I started thinking about the things that I have to accomplish that day you and I talk all the time about all the things that have to be around here the commercials that have to be gotten in the system doing doing radio\nWhether it's music or talk is a lot more complex throughout the course of the day that I think a lot of people realize is allow a gallon needs to go into it there's a lot of documentation that goes into it as you're well aware and I don't have enough time in the day to get the basic things done that I Want to get done let alone be pissed off about everything in the world around me\nIs exhausting and if you have time to be that angry or upset you need a hobby and or a boyfriends last girlfriend and in some cases that might be the same person\nBut either way there are too many people in this world that have entirely too much time on their hands and not enough thoughts in their head to occupy themselves\nI got nothing on that 'cause you're right ...\nWell you know what what brings me to say that James is that every story that I have in front of me\nAnd I probably have a two dozen\n... maybe Eighteen\nI brought it was just looking at the same on\nEvery one of them is a story of somebody being\nP O D mhm and I I just I don't have that much energy\nBecause being being upset and angry at first off it has a major effect a negative effect on your on your body and on your health but in a larger sense just a waste of time and I cannot for the life of me get my head around it so you know I'm going to and I think that's part of the reason that she and I because we need to turn the radio on you\nKnow she and I were just talking the hallway and the dog was running around the back seat which still is apt to do and just having a big old time just hanging out the sunroof was open the sun was out it was a beautiful day and just gotten away from all this nonsense and then you come home you're kind of deacon pressing you turn the TV on and it's like no\nYou know how much I'll listen to the news or watch news or anything this weekend the euro yeah if I was in the ... I had\nMy whatever MP three player or whatever I don't have an odd but music yeah that's all it either I was listening to music or doing some around the house or at tannahill doing summit tannahill or or something\nYeah well there's a lot to be said for what you guys do out of ten of heroin and the and the crafting stuff that you guys do just now doing something with your hands it was just like you know I get hanging the light fixtures yesterday it was just nice just to do what you know having to deal with the wiring it all the other things that go into that\nBut just me now to to kind of back away from it briefly at kind of put things in perspective\nAnd I you know it was Sunday and everybody got most everybody got the church and they're they're doing their thing but then you know you take these hour\nHour and a long respite than you do with the mandatory fried chicken or whatever it is you do after ... after church for lunch and then you come back and all of a sudden we started and are are healthy diet and when I say healthy I mean a lot diet is that it's helpful but this heavy diet if you will\nJust consternation ... victory all hatred and despair\nOr by your chaser yeah\nThere is as soon as she story about this uh two thousand year old stone inscription that was on earth\nAnd Israel the find is the first full spelling of Jerusalem on a stone inscription according to archaeologists the artifact was found during an excavation and the area of Jerusalem's international convention center noticed something I could not possibly even attempt to pronounce\nPart of the stone column the inscription mentioned ...\nOf Jerusalem's international convention center noticed something I could not possibly even attempt to pronounce\nPart of the stone Colombian scripture mentions ... written just what and hey you brew and usually the same sprawling today according to the Israeli antiquities authority written in the age of Arabic language the inscription reads [noise]\n\n... helped me out here\nAnd song the heck out of school said had ally and sunflower\nOf a ... of Jerusalem I guess it's pronounced bottle ruin a ...\nBut it's got some interesting interesting pictures with it as well experts at data the fine to the second temple period or the first century a day the first and second several periods descriptions measuring Jerusalem are very very rare and\nAnd frankly it's the lack of this type of evidence but oftentimes causes those that are of the ah\nComing up on the terms which are two weeks from tomorrow we can pretty much guarantee that we're going to start hearing chance about the children\nWell here's my thing so the these cats started off in Honduras right under says roughly twelve hundred miles away\nFrom the U.S border land was right\nIf they were to walk twenty miles a day now using some of the pictures of these people they're not starving or they got some begins with them now they're walking twenty miles a day yeah I mean that's begins it twenty miles a day that's all on the East River magazine by the way\nI'm Serious I Know I don't know that was I think it was big homes but anyways um same thing yeah\nShut up big um [noise] that sixty sixty days to make it from Honduras to the U.S border if they're walking twenty miles a day they started a week ago so roughly a little bit of ...\nThat would put them at the U.S border before like a week before Christmas\nHow much you want to bet they are going to be at the border two or three days before election oh yeah I'm sure there's buses involved so how are these poor people getting trucked up there at who's feeding these people who's called 'cause a lot of people are walking around with no luggage right\nSo who's given clothing what what's going on and be honest\nYou look at uh Mexico government and all that Donald Trump said hey you stop 'em or we stopped pains\nThey're bussing right through the police along the police are just standing there yeah they're not doing anything yeah\nWell you know it also raises the issue that the Mexican government supposedly said as they cross the Mexican southern Mexican border that each one of them but have to go through the process just across the country it would be like that scene in Blazing Saddles where there's the toll booth [laughter]\nIf you haven't seen the movie it probably makes no sense to somebody to go back and get more times but [laughter]\n\nBut you know it it makes you wonder how in the world will be keeping this group together if they all have to go through this process individually what it means is that the Mexican government is not doing what the Mexican Government is suggesting that is doing\nAnd that's all the object to keep the checks from a\nBouncing so to speak [noise]\nWe need a moat with alligators and bull sharks since bull sharks and survive and freshman salt water mhm yeah and fire fire need extra\nLasers the alligators with lasers in their eyes I mean\nI've gotten sharks would lasers on their ... and a stringer claim or is that a trip wire along the border one person trips or they're they're gonna think twice\nI mean and the reason why I say that a lot of these people or oh you can do that oh that's in in human and inhumane and all that and this okay\nLook at all the ... the Lebanese want to turn this country and embrace socialism right what do Ninety nine point nine Ninety five percent social nations do that either put landmines or some kind of\nDeterrent if you will around their borders to keep people out and to keep people in went and shit and the left embrace that idea to do a whole Cambodian field right\nTo keep people out and to keep people in ... and shooting the wealth embrace that idea to do a whole Cambodian field right they're nothing but lam on\nWell you know we've seen that time and time and time again and there was a map it came out over the weekend showing the red and blue states and I'm telling you this country has gone\nIt's gone hyper read\nIn the last several weeks now that does not necessarily mean that that will translate into the polling or the voting two weeks from tomorrow yeah but in terms of the people that are seen this for what it is I mean even Nancy Pelosi is now getting shot down\nOver the weekend Mitch McConnell and Elaine Chao his wife were actually you know they were dining they're eating and all of a sudden people start getting on them and then what happened was the patrons rose up\nNow these are people that presumably are in one of the blue as areas of the country rising up against the people that are detractors towards Mitch McConnell\nSo people and they they've gotten to the point James or they have seen it but what it is they're fed up beyond belief about it and I think it's I think it's it looks like on the outside because we keep hearing this idiotic crap about blue wave versus red white and it would appear\nAs though the redness is I'm I'm Talking I hate to say it but it's going crimson baby\n\nAnd you know if you're at the coast and you see flags are warnings for red tide\nYou better high town went to the beach I mean like I Will water but a lot of uh a lot of blue Dems are not seeing it and a lot of the the walk away movement is growing ... and I think if we get people to the polls and do not do not for a single moment\nThink that this is not going to fall on your shoulders 'cause I mean we need eighty percent participation\nA week from Tuesday otherwise we're going to be dealing with this kind of nonsense over and over and over again and if people think for one moment it's not going to affect us in the state of Alabama you aren't terribly wrong that's not the first eight six six five five one nine nine three three hey Jim what's up\nI got good news for you guys yes\nI did two hundred and twenty pounds\nHey you know [laughter] let's get to a hodgepodge of different topics James I thought you weren't going to go to stop the little short how many children do you do what the DMZ in South Korea\nNon\nYou never know camp Robert oh no I'm surprised I thought that's what you did you do definitely going up there at least what I Can't stand the style of kimchi\nGod the ditch you don't you find a job that you have to get to complete a tetanus a\nA thing you have to get like twelve shots in your abdomen if you fall in there but don't you don't know what to do it is when you get around ... especially\nYou have open sewers where people go and just in this little ditch told the joke and you don't want to fall in there are a lot of airman do when they're drunk because you know they wander off into strange place anyway the United states already and I'm not play on the United States Army props\nI Know flown to it but and that's particularly case United States army knows how to patrol a DMZ\nIt got a long time\nAnd President Trump has said these are that way\nThrow a DMZ they've done it on time\nAnd President Trump has said these are the weekend guys who sit around the harbor retweeted weapons for a an afternoon and they'd go home and collect their pay\nBusiness regular units coming out of where James Fort Bliss Fort\nHood a cow they're really good I don't know what the list is I Know that there is an aviation a regiment there and see how you had guys what part of this terrible written it\nOkay which what Katherine Dunn do they play trial there going straight down to that border to stop this mess God and President Trump is threatening to pull out of the UN should have been done a minimum of Thirty years ago\nI don't know boy what a what is the expenditure we'd have to keep the I'm just it doesn't have to be exact just ballpark at that\nKeeps the un afloat\nI mean it it's in the it's it's in the eighty to Ninety million dollar I'll just say it's tens of millions\nOkay we take that out we uh we use that for building up the military\nThe guard our stinking borders here's something else that I thought you're going to mention James where you're talking about communist countries with landmines this will be a union\nAnd communist China to build a hobby country had something unique in terms of borders that have nowhere else in the world they had nuclear land mines between the countries which to this day in Mongolia that Russian\nWhenever a service or just I'm sure it's a specialized army unit or ... are still removing the nuclear landmines from the Soviet era okay list that\nWe've been generous to the tune of thirty million from Mexico and central and South America okay if you don't believe that\nThey can ride up to Albert\n... donors Alabama where the chicken plants are\nStick your hand in there and say hey who let that go hey you know how many people will raise their hand and probably the wrong\nGuy now we have a duty to our children and to our grandchildren to protect our borders borders language culture will plagiarize when that went from\nI think a man by the name of Michael Savage okay and I'm telling you unless you want\nTo fall into a one party state which is the whole planet the Democrats now to get these daily goes up here yet and they are the absentee ballots where you don't have to show up and you put a name and he got personality that started it now I think we know where all of the losses", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Guys", "city":
