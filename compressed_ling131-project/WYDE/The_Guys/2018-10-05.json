restaurant quality food it was smoke chicken and Jasmine rice I didn't know what Jasmine tasted like but I ate the rice Jasmine rice tastes like popcorn I'm just going to go out there and say I don't know why they call it Jasmine rice I called popcorn right because when I hear Jasmine rice I wasn't going to eat it at first but when I hear popcorn rice I'm him\nBut I'm totally but nevertheless you need to go check on my friends or a meal that dot co W. W. W. dot ... dot the place to go\nAnd we check them out let them know the Baylor from low wake up call sent you eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation again that's eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three\nSo before we went to break a I told ... and ah I was telling everybody else that you know from a legal perspective from a political perspective whenever I make an argument I like for it to not I I like to have a religious side to it right because obviously your religion influences your value such\nArgument I like for it to not I I like to have a religious side do it right because obviously your religion influences your value set your religion influences your morals it's your ideological subset an atheist and even an atheist right they had these ideological subsets\nI mean they're not faith in a higher being but still they have these things that define how they're supposed to live as does any faith that including Christianity so I like to have an argument it's based on those states that's right I like to have that but at the same time\nI Know not everybody agrees my faith that they're for I Want to have the discussion\nFrom a non religious basis is the true meaning of success serving others in making the community around you better I think it's really interesting question because my argument\nEarlier it wasn't really an argument my statement earlier my stance earlier was completely formulated around religion so if we remove religion from that\nWhat does it do eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three to join the conversation eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three to join Oregon a hop skip talk on my one skipped back how you doing\nA good morning John yeah this is these are really important uh topics mhm I'm now in a matter of a serving others um\nI I Would suggest that the free markets and a voluntary charities or\nDoes it does a wonderful job no matter where you are on the religious spectrum I think the markets and and charities are wonderful job um otherwise you're just sacrificing a you're you're giving up or something or without much in a way of return for this world and\nAnd I wanted to talk a little bit about the um the issue of um this world this natural world versus um the the supernatural world and um [noise]\nUh I I wasn't he concedes that some you know there is a face out there that is important people [noise] uh and it is in concert distinction\nTo the real natural world there there there are side by side that really don't mix well together but a quarter of an ask is this is serious legitimate question no matter where are you on the political or put a religious spectrum is a very important question\nAnd it has to do a with opportunity cost we talked about this very important that are a last week it's very essential with our limited resources in time and the question I coach just mess if you have\nThis very important values system called face\nThat resides alongside the real world how do you know and to move from one to the other how does one decide when you've\nPrayed enough or look for enough miracles are spent enough time on your knees or looking and not a scientific book to deal with real physical medical problems\nBut in the holy book ... and how does one decide how to allocate their time\n[noise] um I I I think this is a it's a it's a legitimate question because\nI got an answer people okay great let's hear\nNot a binary everybody puts up as binary right you can either spend time in a or spend time and be the best thing I've ever heard was that I'm from a religious standpoint when you're going through your life you're supposed to be living your life in prayer and living your life in prayer me\nThis constant communication with the guide you live your life with God walking among side you that's why religious people quite literally believe that God is leading you on a path\nUm uh I forget the specific birth or a burst but it talks about I'm On the path that he guides me like a like that's the whole Princeton\nBelieve that God is leading you on a path um uh I forget the specific birth or burst but it talks about I'm On the path that he guides me like a like that's the whole principle and that God is walking alongside you so this life isn't meant to\nBe where we put God in the box right and every like thirty minutes to an hour we look to God and then we looked at the world and we look back to God and we looked at the world we live through the lens of God with God guiding us through that\nWe go into the world that makes sense well\nA ... let me let me uh pursue this a little bit further into their ah ah you know um when you're confronted with a problem in this world yeah and you struggle\nYou have one of two choices you can I continue to pursue this in a scientific a rational fashion or do you advocate that and you can immediately look\nTo a higher power and search for miracles prayer and and that's and I get I understand\nThat but the ... falls\nBut then when you pray Wendy's one decide when to give up let me ask you thinking and and and ... and ... and ... you're valuable time and you're valuable thoughts off to the supernatural\nSo let me let me ask you a question so if somebody has cancer and they're in a cancer ward and they're being treated for cancer they're being treated by people that have read the medical textbooks are following the residents given to them they're following the medicine but at the same time they're praying that disproves the binary you're saying because not only are they huh I'm Sorry go ahead\nSir gentleman you cannot do two things at once you cannot be thinking about doing surgery a scalpel and be imagining that that's something supernatural at the same time you need to be tending to this world you cannot be distracted by something supernatural\nBut I really I don't think it's a distraction I think the idea that you can't do two things at the same time as wrong because we can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time you know like I I mean it just the idea that we can't be thinking about\nTwo things at once I I just think that's wrong because again when you view it through a lens right I don't view it as God's going to heal me just out of supernatural power five can survive a broken leg or I Need surgery I view it as God has blessed this person here who has the passions and have the talent and therefore has gone to medical school and has\nThis knowledge this knowledge that have come through the world the world that God created and he\nThrew a blessing from God is going to heal me you can look at it in the same and it's not this binary that set up to where you have to either be in God or be in the world I mean I think that bind area's really falls\nI think that by area is essential and it really a a really a determines how this world is is going to the um pursued now um [noise] if if if the supernatural\n... let me let me ask you a question when you are so I I mean I Know we're not going to agree on this but I just want to go ahead and they like to hear enough\nI'm so\nAtheism in and of itself as a theology neither theology my apologies I was ... that was misspoke a\nMisspeak atheism in and of itself is a um it it is an idea it's an ideology right there is nothing to prove\nAtheism just like there's nothing to prove religion there is nothing to disprove either of them so atheism in and of itself as an ideology therefore are you pursuing the world with this idea are you entering what you would call the world and its binary with the view of ideology of through your ideology\nThey prayed for that Dr right they prayed\nFor the blessing of that doctrine that Dr increased their lifespan exponentially I have also walk through with somebody who beat cancer right of walk through the journey with them and they prayed for that Dr ... we had prayer circles where we prayed for those doctors that we're working on him\nBut we we pray I mean you always hear whenever somebody's going into surgery we pray for the hands of the doctor to work as seamlessly as they can to work fantastic and they're there to be no mistakes et cetera you don't pray\nFor essentially just a miracle to happen and God to he'll he'll young spot sometimes you do and that has happened with some people right but largely enough it it's the it's it's like the people that don't get their children vaccinated\nBecause they think God will protect them I personally think that's really stupid I think God gives us the knowledge to look and see okay this vaccination inherently helps people is\nI personally think that's really stupid I think God gives us the knowledge to look and see okay this vaccination inherently helps people this vaccination that God gave somebody the mental cognition to understand and come up with this vaccination and it keeps you safer and approves your lifespan\nOne guy's creations made that with the knowledge got put in his head so you should use that because scientists conclusively proven that it helps you not get sick\nRight ... it's just it's it's a basic idea and so I think that binary is inherently faults and he was saying look there's scientific truth and there's and there's what religion believes and he said two plus two equals four\nAnd I I I took some pushback on that and then he tried to make the argument or using two plus two dozen equal for I'm not saying two plus two dozen equal for I'm seeing two plus two does equal for but two is inherently a unit of measure right we're going to have something plus to have something equals for if something\nIn that unit of measure isn't tire early\nMan made just like the construct of time but we didn't appear on this earth and then there was time like there's night and there's day that's the only time that is natural\nRight these these twenty four hour cycles we operate on I mean it has to do with the earth rotating right or what we perceive it does it does have to do with the earth's rotation is not a perception of the earth's rotation it is the earth's rotation but nevertheless\nA lot of these things a lot of these contracts especially having to do with measurement are manmade so Dylan you had a really good point on this as we were going to break so what\nDo you think of that idea because ah you you took ... I saw you like pop up you're like I got this I Know the answer when he was like two plus two equals four and I was like it's actually a unit of measurement by man what do you think about\nThat okay so let's go back to the time for just a moment yeah you said that night and day is the only measure of time that we have yeah well natural measure\nOur long and that I Would even argue against that because I told me one night and day or the manmade contracts to a\nDesignate I uh I guess would be the proper word which a side of the earth you're on that's currently facing the sun or not yeah so we're just on one big ... that spinning in or orbiting a massive ball of fire\nYeah that's about where\nThe non main made a description in ... yeah\nEverything pass that that would like lead into time yeah is completely manmade night day hours minutes second ... years even that's all manmade yeah\nSo in your major I Know you do a lot having to do and you study this a lot a lot of having to do with numbers and calculus and things of that nature\nSo what do you say to somebody that says like two plus two equals four obviously that's true but can you break down is that a manmade measure is not a manmade measure\nOkay so number systems are completely manmade there are number systems out there where you can say and be valid that two plus two equals ten\nThat two plus two equals eleven mhm I think it was the only to alternate are honestly but there are alternate or number systems ... number system that we currently use is known as the bass man mhm okay\nSo\nHow these work is you can look at each value as being different exponential of that base number and\nHow these work is you can look at each value as being different exponential of that base number though and depending on what you change the base to you'd have different values like a a\nA base to number system is all ... zeroes ... whereas a base ten is anything from the earth or nine in each place value\nAnd that makes sense because everything is alternating going up by tens and I ... I really like the fact that we're able to bring that up because I think that ... and I made the claim during last conversation that a lot of atheism is a faith set rise not faith and a higher power it's actually the opposite it's a fate that there is no higher power because\nYou cannot prove God nor can you disapprove God just like you can't prove there is no God and you can disapprove there is no God both are\nEntirely sat around a state right you have faith that this is true and you can point to things that you say are evident cheery basis is for these claims but at the end of the day to prove isn't conclusive\nDid get thrown out in the court of law you cannot prove either beyond a reasonable doubt\nSo the question then remains a it really strikes the heart of this binary that you can either view the world through the world through objective fact\nWhen a lot of the things we perceived to be fact art in the fact man made the way that we view the world right and so this is a really really\nComplex idea but I'm Glad this conversation open up because this is something that we cannot\nOverlook\nAnd when we come back ... are going to try to break down the conversation of\nOur our way is service the way to success for non religious standpoint that's how we're going to close up the show we had some news to bring you but we can bring it to tomorrow I think this is a really important conversation and I want to pursue this conversation the final Fifteen but\nWe're about to get a banana here's a live from recall chaos heating and AIR Studios Alabama license one eleven twenty this a wakeup call you're listening to the wake up call\nRaised in Alabama educated at John Carroll Sanford university you a B and Birmingham School of law you see my face off thousands of billboards but did you know that over twenty five thousand of your neighbors have trust me when they needed help the most\nThat's what I'm thankful for I'm Alexander ...\nA man for the people I Want to be your attorney call me Alabama representation\nIt's maintenance quality legal services before and scream and those lawyers\nHey guys forty of 'em before faction traditions of the original state is fired apparel companies they offer upscale casual slogan including\nShirts hats out a way of ties shores accessories was subtle states away I'm guessing you probably want to represent our great yellow hammer stay real hammer supply company has a great mix of shirts jacket and even work out for the with the subtle yellow birds that we all know what to do a\nTradition can be found at the summit in between Willie Pulitzer and Scott [noise]\nDo you want to melt fat yet Tony didn't have the body you've always wanted then you need to check out science try fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education I even tried to get healthy trends sat and gain muscle iron tried to currently looking for forty locals who want to participate in a free six weeks challenge that is guaranteed to get the results [noise]\nWith that challenge you'll get accustomed meal plan personal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you ...\nWe think we challenge that is guaranteed to get you result with that challenge you'll get a cut the meal plan personal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you reach your goal wait the challenge is absolutely free contact your closest tried today to find out more spring\nThe whole family out the Talladega super speedway for the kid be I'd be a serious it's twelve another tissue from a number of great options behind the scenes like guy garage doors pre race but a lot more\nA raid Talladega\nThose super station is coming to your home do go to one oh one W.

[noise]\nWhat the Senate leadership knows that he's not\nTo be around on Saturday for the Kavanaugh vote because he's gotta walk his daughter down the aisle this is going to be our wedding which will take place in Montana on Saturday\nA a steady personally call Kavanaugh Thursday evening and told him that I Will be there to vote for you as needed now from a procedural perspective once the actual voting takes place for the confirmation\nAs needed now from a procedural perspective wants the actual voting takes place for the confirmation\nMitch McConnell has the right to keep the voting open until Sunday Morning this just happened though last evening where we learn that Danes has said\nPoint black I'm walking my daughter I mean I realize there's no way this has been planned there's no way I'm not going to be there I could not have possibly for told this was going to happen\n\nSo he is going to go to Montana\nAnd presumably jump on a plane fly back to D.C after the wedding for the purposes of voting by early Sunday Morning\nBut I wanted to tell you that the social media sphere blew up last night you did nasty because people originally this guy said hey\nAin't gonna make it wouldn't be burden and that's all we really knew so now the sudden Lisa Murkowski Joe Manchin flake\nSusan Collins all these guys every one of them than mattered also from a procedural perspective the vice president is not allowed to vote if there's not a hundred Senate votes even abstention would count\nBut an absent tea but not the number of senators present the vote down to Ninety nine\nHe cannot break that tie constitutionally speaking there has to be one hundred votes or abstention so all of a sudden pens just completely off the table\nI was thinking about this this morning and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm going to preface this with this\n\nAnd I'm not being satirical and not being tongue in cheek\nI the last few days I got a lot of things 'cause I'm working on we're about to start pod casting\nThe heart of America stuff not related to the bus routes are doing a podcast called on America will get even deeper and some of the stories of the contained in the book also looking into the possibility of expanding the program straight into Internet based radio that will happen sometime in the near future\nSo you'll be listening to live in the evenings as well as the potash because of that\nI've encountered a restless the last few nights because I'm kind of guys that I I make lists constantly I've got books all over the place no books here and there with a list for dinner this list to do that but I also am I was in my head I make so many listed on what to do is just doesn't make a list\nAnd the same kind of popped up in my head about four o'clock this morning this I'm laying in bed this guy's going to fly to Montana\nHe's going to give his daughter away in his wedding he has said\nTo Fox News Shannon brain specifically that he personally call Kavanaugh to reassure him that he will be presenter vote\nWe don't know and we probably won't until the ... the twelve hour where mansions like Collins and Murkowski are going to come down this guy Steve Gaines could be the deciding vote he said he will be there to pass said vote\n\nWhat is the possibility considering the tension the yanks consternation\n\nThere's a possibility considering the tension the yanks the consternation\nThat he has car trouble on his way home it's a possibility that he can't get out of the wedding venue\nLet me do you see all the possibilities here first off his wedding is probably going to have protesters show up in ...\nThen there's also the issue of um I don't know\nMaybe he had\nAn unfortunate event occur that prevented him from making it back to D.C stranger things\nI'm putting that out there because I Want people to keep an eye on this because if something like that were to occur it is time to literally arrest the Democratic party\n\nTo take into custody George Soros and slapped cops on every protester in this country and I'm telling ya I'm not suggesting martial law but I Am suggesting coming down hard\nBecause I Will be shocked stoned amazed and surprised if when this wedding goes off tomorrow does he is going to be here for the procedural vote today then he flies a Montana\nThere are so many possibilities where that can go and I cannot imagine for a single moment that this wedding they will they protested funerals\n\nYou got the Westboro Baptist church out there protesting military funerals do we think for one moment\nThat some Soros inspired or Soros employed protesters would not make it to this venue to make our real show out of it I don't know if I was him of our lives that are made that announcement\n\nBut I Do have concerns for him getting back to D.C in a timely fashion if you catch my direct don't know anything it's pure four AM speculation on my part\nAnd I am not a conspiracy theorist but I Will tell you in this politically charged environment that we're in in this country\nAnything is possible for the years I've done this\nCaller's email or emails text messages and those of you that showed up at our various Romo votes have asked my opinion on the outcome of certain political events I Can't necessarily boasted Ninety eight percent accuracy rate\nBut I can certainly both in eighty eight I Am right much more frequently than I Am wrong\nI ain't got nothing on this one outside of what we've been told because right now anything in this jars environment anything as a possibility\nIf they have any grain of common sense and I'm Talking about\nThe GOP\nKnowing what what's going on in the social climate is with all this mess going on that they would either a sneak him out today through the basement into one of the unmarked cars or whatever that D.C police using get him to the airport or whatever\nOr\nSomebody would let him use a jet to get there and back and I mean that someone might be you know Trump International corporations um I I don't know someone could donate an aircraft or something 'cause there's no way\nThat'd be you know Trump International ...
