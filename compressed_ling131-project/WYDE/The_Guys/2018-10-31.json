[laughter]\nOr whether they get off my lawn a six foot five five one Ninety nine\nThirty there isn't over to join the conversation again\nThat's eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three so Joe ... we talked about this a little bit last night on the show and before we get back into the Alabama general election stuff I got to know when we got to let listeners know what do you think about um this new thing that Donald Trump came out in an interview with ... dot\nCom about and it's talking about birthright citizenship and ... a potentially an executive order to\nBasically do away with this concept of birthright citizenship seems to circumvent the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution but what do you think about that\nCan't have it both ways if we say we're constitutions we say we want small government will say we conservatives say Republican you know um it can be shouldn't be done and everybody should be outraged that he actually I'm\nEven thought about saying yeah because we're talking about changing the constitution and let's just be honest if President Obama anybody else would have said this talking about touching\nThe word D. E. A. O. anything inside the constitution we will lose our money yeah right mhm because we were saying they are fun to men fundamentally trying to change the way this country has been done for ages indicates let's think about this\nDonald Trump comes out on a on a subject that everybody feels you know ... immigrants need to be giant ... so that's okay because it's your guy right and is your subject you know\nIf you are who you say you are right and you truly believe in the constitution president Donald Trump number two things no you shouldn't be just in the constitution it all the other thing is we bash the crap out of President Obama when he did he\nYou know you shouldn't be touching the constitution it all the other thing is\nWe bash the crap out of President Obama when he did he owed executive order exactly because we're talking about the constitution let's just talk about the real quick ... if you did the ... if he says it's going to be an EEO four to eight years from now the next president will come in and do what\nHe's going to the constitution into an executive order right or whatever he just deal with this with this e oh they do you think of all they want to go do they can come in and counselor yeah we didn't learn anything about what happened with President Obama when he did it for the dreamers and did you get all these folks to come out until all the information to the government would executive order yeah OK\nPresident Obama visited them and some came in and said we're taking all that away because well information is\nAll the government has all that information now mhm so that people are not going to trust the ... the the government anymore because now that information that the government has brother that Donald Trump is using that to find these people also see people haven't talked about that ... ... e oh is not the way you run the country now do you do it by legislation by going to make it a low\nExactly and I agree with you I think ... executive orders should only be used in the case of an extreme tragedy or a natural disaster or war time\nBecause basically what they're saying is we don't care what the checks and balances that this government has in place to make this a Democratic Republic we don't care about that we're just gonna circumvent those entirely and the president is going to order from top down if we're just gonna let everything go go about as an executive order like kind of what happened under the Obama administration\nThan how we might as well just become a dictatorship at that point because it's just one man telling everybody what they should be doing at that point and now I Do not think that's what we're headed for right I Do not think this will stand I think this will be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court and it would be shot down I don't even think it would make it to the Supreme Court I think it'd be shut down by a lower court but even if it made it to the Supreme Court\nThe person that he just put on the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh will not stand for this because basically what I'm saying is you were taking this fourteenth amendment right and we're saying\nWe're just gonna go straight around that that's what this executive order saying now in saying that do I think that the birthright citizenship is a loophole in our immigration system is absolutely absolutely but nevertheless the text of the constitution does state that does born on us soil and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens and if you're in the United states you're subject to the jurisdiction thereof but just my opinion eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three I Want to hear yours is go to bill on line one bill how're you doing\nYou're taking my call no problem you know you just said the line that removes your argument you are subject to the jurisdiction of the United states ... if you are here illegally\nYou know what other than you know legally if you break the law you know you have no right you have none of that forget amendment was designed during the size of a civil war and for the slaves to free slaves and whatnot because they weren't given citizenship back that\nIt was designed to allow them to be and upon being free it does not add up to do with illegal immigration back as low as well and that's what the push is right now I Know you've got Lindsey Graham doing it back in Ninety three Harry Reid wanting it that's all over the Internet\nSo that's not a new subject and to vilify sharp you talk about an executive order what was dark [noise]\nAgain I'm I'm I'm totally against you know when we talk about executive orders I I hated it when President Obama did it and it in a day for the mental um if you're doing is they can afford and we went on him you shouldn't be doing anything that's\nI'm that provided the quote that all non citizen Indians born within the territorial limits of the United states and a bee in their hereby declare citizens of the United states it's basically the same thing the thing is that there's been some of the legal immigrants here except it was passed because you know they wanted to make it overwhelmingly clear\nYeah an elk versus Wade Wilkins they brought that up and Eighteen eighty four the alien and dependent condition of the members of the Indian tribes could not put off at their own free will without the action or a set of the United states signify either by treaty or legislation\nYeah but the precedent set in elk versus Wilkins was overturned in the United states be one Kim art\nBut it all becomes precedent when they bring up a long Kim art which declared a that a lot of citizen had birthright citizenship but never refer to illegal aliens\nDoesn't have to because ... court ruled that a person who quote is born in the United states or is it\nThat never refer to illegal aliens\nChill doesn't have to because ... are offering court ruled that a person who quote is born in the United states or is a parents who at the time of his versus are subject to foreign powers which would be an illegal immigrant whose parents have permanent dom asylum in the ... or residents in the United states\nWhose parents are they're carrying on business and are not employed and any diplomatic or official capacity of a foreign power to which they're subject to becomes at the time a bird a citizen of the United states by virtue of the first clause of the fourteenth amendment of the constitution it's very clear\nActually there was no that is still today no legislation that says an illegal alien has both really citizenship\nIt ... it is that if it right there Henry\nIt it really does I mean it is an illegal alien just is an illegal alien somebody who at ... or illegal aliens subject to a foreign power or they residents in ... under the jurisdiction of drawing of a foreign power when they're in a foreign power state or they said it's going to go to our\nWhy as an ally in and out and it is because they belong to another country they a hunger is stopping the true the other\nHenry Henry you're right but that means that they are of a foreign power correct\nSo wait a minute when they belong to a foreign power just by them saying I'm now in American they come in American\nHenry and we know that are not right but they are of a foreign power under ... overturned the precedent setting Elvie Wilkins it's as anyone born in the United states of parents who at the time of his birth are subject to a foreign power are citizens of the United states\nBy virtue of called the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution\nBased on the end of the ... you know when when a man who writes the actual amendment says it did not go ... no\nNo he's a little ... and the fourteenth amendment was written in response the Dred Scott be Sanford and let you answer trainers one different\n... wrote and what the frame or believe even going to the federalist papers they use that to to commit these president just you know I I understand that it's a it's a ambiguous ... you know the section five powers of the\nOf the ... of the ... Congress could be used to prevent the children of illegal aliens from automatically becoming citizens but\nThe effort you know failed in Ninety seven\nHere we're limited obviously Americans of course when you're okay if we don't want to believe this president Donald Trump the Republicans why don't we go ahead and passed the low don't do it ... passed a law I'm\nNot saying that you know that you know it shouldn't be done and I'm not going to another loophole\nPast below that is what we're doing now\nI understand what you're saying but that that you're you're ... you're on a beginning on a false pretense gee\nYou know if you want to do it if you want it ... if he wanted wanted\nChange he doesn't want to change your miss what we were saying there is the fact is is reinforcing it you're\nDone with the older you with the email is ... the accelerates bringing attention to the fact that we ... we ... the man that was originally and ... the original intent was for the for\nThe heat bringing attention to what the deal that can be raised with the next president when does it matter\nBecause we don't want them a oh we want to change the law and there's you know there's a reason why we shouldn't do that but what you're missing the point that is reinforcing the original intent of the fourteenth amendment that maybe we can get a law may\nHenry and I totally understand that and guess what I'm with you I think that it is a loophole in the system however he is using executive order to overcome set precedent\nThe loophole in the system however he is using executive order to overcome set precedent story does ISIS let the president stand\nIn the United states for one Kim art that said this is what the fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution is saying the Supreme Court ruled on it it's in the constitution if you want change change it in the legislature\nBut we cannot change it by executive order that is circumventing the Supreme Court and the United States Constitution if we're willing to do that and why the hell do we have either one of them\nWell for one again that you're missing the point we're not trying to change it we're trying to reinforce it\nNo no you are trying to change the precedent Henry and United States for ... it it said that exactly what I'm\nSaying here that if you were born in the United states you are a citizen of the United states it was a very very clear and it was the president said Eighteen Ninety eight\nActually the majority opinion and ... the show all the things that you can include the children born in the United states will be legal as well as legal immigrants but there is no case\nWhich Supreme Court as a ... that it was just the other end of the fourteenth amendment that is a fact\nHenry let me ask you a question so if the Supreme Court holds up something having to do with the second amendment\nRight if the Supreme Court makes a ruling there do you think that Donald Trump or brought in and let's say do you think Brock Obama should pass an executive order to go around with the Supreme Court says and what it's like I'm In the United States Constitution says to take away some guns if the Supreme Court says we should be able to hold onto\nThat we're dealing with a whole new language\nAnd none of them and then it's going around the Supreme Court precedent and a constitutional amendments you\nCan't do that because of the word friendship infringement is\nLikely to get infringe on any other amendment Henry you can't you can't go home and have others\nOther lemons don't having friends just like the first amendment as the same language okay Henry Hey the first amendment then\nYou're the unit picking at a broad concept take the person about say brought Obama does it to the first amendment\nActually I'm trying to rely on the word and branched infringed has a meaning and I know many social people in society today wanted change the meaning of words\nBut that's what we're doing here no ...\nNo you can't have any legislator any person and the government and friendship Honda Second Amendment\nHey Henry Henry internal argument is predicated on the phrase subject to the jurisdiction there let me ask you something when the illegal immigrant that came into this country that killed Tate stunningly shot Kate silently what's he indicted on under United States will\n\nThey put them under the morning after the\nQuestions yes or no was indicted on the United states while she was of course they had\nTaken the trial and of course was he found guilty or innocent\nHe was found not guilty and my eyes and\nSo here's the thing is it that subject to the jurisdiction of the law of the United states\nBut he had no at legions\nIt doesn't matter where in higher tell you that I have anything to do with allegiance to the subject of the jurisdiction there up it's a reach\nI appreciate your brother but it's a major each we're headed out to break eight six six five five one

W D. J. C. breaking out in the election or doing something where they don't know what we're going to be doing that 'cause we don't have we have a red wave or a blue wave\nBut this is our final Wednesday on the air Eric Walker is going to be joining us you guys are very familiar with rabbi Walker also a little bit later on my brother and sister log into pop and talked about some weird Halloween stuff as we wrap up for the ghettos coming door to door and pandering for sugar\nGesture lower taxes smaller government conservative del marsh for state Senate paid for by march for Senate PO box to three six five pedestal in Alabama three six to to\nSays talk radio has to stick to just the way you can find out about what's coming up what's going on or what do you miss life following had one super station all this would have forcibly go to Facebook dot com and search for super station\nWanna why why do you can take us wherever you go to the super station one on one ... it's like having your own personal news anchor in Norfolk\nThat's not creepy and all your home town got an countries they should be a super station one oh one nobody wanted [noise]\nCovering all of north and central Alabama\nSuper station one on one somebody why do you [noise]\nI Know [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd\nThey walk it back you know yesterday you sent me a um a a text message that Whitey Bolger had been whacked in the big house yes his first day in a brand new prison in West Virginia yes and a\nLot of folks know and my brother might even speak to us a little bit but he joined us nine o'clock but my family we were never\nBrand new prison in West Virginia yes and a lot of folks know and my brother might even speak to this a little bit when he joined us nine o'clock but my family we were never connected cars were German Irish but we had friends\nIn low places have has especially with my folks lived up in the New York areas specifically my mom\nAnd I said to you almost immediately\nThis was an intentional transfer\nThis was a purposeful whacking and within thirty minutes there was an article up on TMZ that said that there had been a mobster in that same presume that was incarcerated for a murder he committed\nAgainst an associate of Whitey Bolger and then about an hour after that in other article appeared that the associate was in fact a mafia hitman so it looks like Whitey was whacked intentionally\n... and what's funny is if you look at the time on Twitter micro frenzies yeah was texting was tweeting about Whitey Bulger's demise mhm thirty minutes before the news broke\nSo he heard about it before it even broke out at the prison to the news stations and another story is coming down the pike that Whitey Bolger was actually about to\nFlip if you will on the FBI and releasing the information about the FBI's informant program right to the public right\nYeah so it makes you wonder who actually started the move of the prison transfer was his lawyer who got a paycheck or was it the FBI right who actually did it but yeah Whitey Bolger no more what's right and\nWe knew we I mean the ... the moment I texted you I knew that you knew because you get transferred to a prison the first time he comes out of Florida indoor prison where there's somebody there that was involved in a murder that he himself as a as a associated with and he's gone his first day\nNot just that but when that transfer happen he left a federal prison in Florida where he was serving a life sentence where there were no attempt on his life he got moved to Oklahoma for two days\nUntil they prepared for his arrival in West Virginia and then he got to Virginia and within hours of him arriving he's\nDead and it gave me an idea that about whether or not he was confrontational the guys in a wheelchair ... eighty nine years old and they beat him without a lock in a sock out of the way of the cameras and you know whatever these guys are together did there there's guards everywhere which means there's\nProbably some culpability of the prison officials as well\nAnd another story has come out saying that the uh the two guys that they have quote unquote detained in the prison for the the act of violence are actually connected to the east coast grew so ... so\n... is that then there is that All right let's get back out to the phones and we'll talk to poor elope or how are you [noise]\nModel\nSo that my friend\nMan I'm going to measure show you wake me up on and what your insurance music slut ... in a in a in this corner\nWearing short shorts [laughter] [noise]\nThat it's more like glow I'm a poor I appreciate that very much\nA man would go\nThrough to you know and and it's not just asked moving along as a matter of fact it was\nIt was ... that very much\nA man you're going to you know and and it's not just us moving along as a matter of fact it seems that uh five six new sports broadcaster Rick Carly\nHas announced that he's going to be leaving the station in early December after being there for Thirty years in a a post on his Facebook page Carly said his position as sports director is being eliminated and he worked for the sport as a sports director for WBRC\nSince Nineteen eighty nine and it's\nJust you know the the bottom line here whether that has to do with record has to do with us or or anybody for that matter is that the the entire industry\nIs consolidating\nBecause with the advent of things like the Internet the competition and the dollars there's only so much news there's only so many dollars is only so many outlets unfortunately for us\nThere's a lot more outlets and so you know and it comes an issue of you know where people are going to gather their news from I mean you've got Internet based programs that broadcast via Twitter and\nThat have more people listening to them on Twitter that every talk radio station in Alabama has combined them and things are moving that way I mean you know you know you've got how many how many Twitter followers do you have 'cause I've only got like three thousand\nTwenty thirty thousand so that the that sounded so demeaning I didn't\nKnow it now but the point remains the same though Baylor is that people don't realize this is that most of the most of the talk radio stations and not this one but you know there's some in other parts of the states that are smaller\nThey don't have twenty three thousand listeners on a weekly basis you know you've got access to twenty three thousand people on a daily basis and multiple times\nYeah if I put on a video on Twitter it's typically around ten thousand you know I mean that's crazy it's I it's it's a blessing it's been something I've been working for for years now and so with the advent of this Internet age I'm really excited for pot that I Want to join you so we can start promoting a pod cast on all my platforms really really exciting\nWell you know making bars is doing the same thing we have a good friend out in California on a ... to America Amy for Amy's program gets piped in a forty three million households doesn't mean they're all tuned in the same time\nBut you know there's all these opportunities out there and we're lock it does on his program outspoken and there's probably a half a dozen others that we're talking do as well\nAnd we all think along the same lines but the reality of it is is that as we get further and further and further down the media cycle 'cause how much do you think about this for one second I'm gonna go conspiratorial and you're here in ... cars are hurting you lock it talking earlier today about Donald Trump in the executive order thing\nI Am not to believe that that's a shot across the bow of Congress I don't think he ever intent was to implement that that's his way of saying I can do this if you don't do that but if he were to do it and be successful with it now all of a sudden free speech amendments get caught into play and all of a sudden now you're in perhaps you have the chatter of\nA you know the fairness doctrine for example or the critical information needs study comes back into the discussion and Donald Trump not withstanding are moving here from the equation if they want to be successful in that and you guys going to hit on this and I said before myself\nFuture generations of president or Congress has to do something similar where they restrict free speech\nThat threat doesn't reside\nThe Internet ... it it really doesn't and the fact that you can broadcast from anywhere and say anything and there's really not many laws that govern the Internet I mean there are basic laws that govern the Internet but there's not many in terms of speech or anything like that you can say quite literally anything you want a I mean look at Alex Jones ... for example\nUm eastern kind of our ... Howard Stern says wacky things\nBut I'm I'm really looking forward to moving into an Internet platform\n... for example um eastern kind of our ... Howard Stern's isn't wacky things\nBut I'm I'm really looking forward to moving into an Internet platform because of um also like I I ... I enjoy talk radio but I feel like there are sometimes for me you and James are getting into a discussion that's absolutely phenomenal and then it's like let's go to break and then we come back it's just not the same so I'm looking forward to the\nContinuity as well that comes along with the freedom but the continuity that comes with the Internet as well\nWell definitely it's a very exciting thing some exciting times and uh you know rich you guys are given format a I'm a try it will be more conservative talk you've got the other options\nAnd we know that some of you don't wipe the other options and that's just the way that you know folks roller people out there that don't like us and that's just the way that it's going to be so anyway we're going to get off the subject matter your phone calls and they'll be walking but I expect chocolate warm nine three three Eric Walker and the way right now\nWhat about later on my brother and one of my siblings that I actually get along with I was about to say it and then you got along with and not know none of my brother and I were pretty much ... do you even in our family we we've bought\nAnd I looked at her Twitter feed and I I kind of checking out who she following\nAnd it was MSNBC and CNN and Spartacus and the list dress all at all and I'm thinking if that is the only option that you're giving yourself no wonder you draw the conclusion that you draw\nBecause you know for every time I watch Fox News if they're getting into something like the Pittsburgh thing I Will immediately go over to that cute little boy Rachel Matt out\nAnd see what ... what all the rage has to say about it\nAnd the other day you know she had somebody on the ... on her program that is I you know the leader some pardon me Jewish organization he had not heard from the White House yet on the heels of Pittsburgh\nAnd I you know we'll talk to Eric about this when it gets here I'm not familiar with this particular organization but all of a sudden you know this this particular guy had not received a call from the White House and all of a sudden you know Matt out during the ... thing and the thing is is that if if that's all you're going to introduce into your knowledge base\nThen you've got you're going to draw those conclusions based on a false narrative\nIt's all a bunch of feelings or anyone that comes in it's sad because it wasn't the state of actual liberalism but the liberalism but we live in today is a bunch of people coming at you would know facts whatsoever with no real world situations with nothing based in reality and said they come at you with\nHow they feel about certain things and I can be quite Frank I don't give a damn about how you feel about certain things I give a damn what the law says and\nSee well that also there was this thing yesterday where Barbra Streisand and I got a little ... you're my tweets but ah Barbra Streisand apparently is moving to Canada or if the house is not taken\nBack by by it's the same thing she said if Trump got elected and yet she still here\nWho cares about barber shop I mean who cares about any I'm but that's the point is is that okay move\nGo do your thing take your show on the road you got the money live anywhere that you want to but it's like every single time something happens I'm moving I'm leaving like people are going to shutter and I was oh bathtubs oh don't don't do it by oh please stay\nI don't get to know job oh just stay ruins [laughter]\nA maple leaf is born [noise] [noise]\nShe's just liberals are ridiculous like I'm trying to stay away from that language so I feel like that's literally taking a it's taking a whole political ideology and just saying you know this is ridiculous but\nI'm being pushed into this corner by just it's it's not so much that all of them think it is it nobody steps out and says anything against it like for example if Donald Trump comes out and says something\nReally ignorant about passing and oh I don't know executive order that would go round the constitution I Believe we have a problem with immigration but if you say something that ignorant I'm going to step up and call you on it as a ton of conservatives are\nBut it seems like an liberalism you know somebody says something just astronomically crazy race gender age all those are on the spectrum and they're like oh my God you're so forward thinking we absolutely love it we may not agree but we love the fact that you're feeling that I don't I think you're nuts\nWell anytime anybody says I'm a free thinker [laughter] well you know it free is worth\nSee here is that is true but here's the thing I think I'm a free thinker I think that word has been turned so bonkers in today's society and it's just a synonym for ...\nWell see here is that is true but here's the thing I think I'm a free thinker I think that word has been turned so bonkers in today's society and it's just a synonym for post modernism I think real free thinking and making your own decisions is a good thing partisan or policy over partisanship making your own decisions but what whenever liberal says there are free thinker what they mean is there a post modernist\nBecause deeper going on a hump day edition of the Michael hard show ... yeah and that's when they get for feeding the liberal\nEight six six by by one nine nine three three hey mark what's up\nHey now how are you good how are you\nAt all so bumper music and the reference there that was good oh are you going to do ads are you gonna do subscriptions or how's it going to war\nI don't think it'll be subscription based it's it's probably going to be you know primarily along the lines of um\nUh you know affiliate relationships there might be a subscription aspect to it that will be outside of the program itself you know one of the scriptures levels and we looked at it like you know four Ninety five a month or something like that and you'll get a T shirt and a free book and all that kind of stuff but now it will not be subscription base to hear their basic content\nOkay All right oh\nYou know if that's working out I don't know how much a radio station costs and I have floated this on other shows that talked about this previously you find a thousand listeners that are willing to pony up a thousand bucks that's a million dollars you go to a bank and you can get another million how much does a radio station costs\nI don't know exactly how much it would cost but what you just mentioned monetary would be probably a good down payment on one\nI'm thinking I mean you know that would be doable do not underestimate your listenership okay oh the next thing\nCards the only problem that I have with ... with your position on that and I'm saying is we live in my heart it Henry put up a\nThousand dollars that would mean he'd be one of the stock holders in a company that I'd have the answer to\nWell this is true Michael that's the problem with like the chief executive officer when you have stockholders\nYeah can you imagine Henry Jim from Marshall County David from San Francisco being my stock holders oh my God I ...\nI Would have requests I Would want mope Andy bumper once in awhile\n... Mandy yeah man that's a throwback\nWell you go get my band the American or too old to die young and see if you don't get chill bumps or tear up a you know I Know oh have you been following the Mueller accusation since they came out\nI heard it and I've not really followed it I understand some lady was apparently paid twenty thousand dollars to claim that uh\nMueller approached her\nWell so yeah there's that and you know I think it was probably about two or three weeks ago I called in and you know this has gotten to be where it so easy and it would be a way to get ... out of his contract if somebody wanted to save money\nSo you got to wonder about that aspect here and then\nLet's take it a step further you remember how ... step in on the uh Blasey Ford thing with the sweat Nick allegations\nYeah that needs to be\nA new verb in our lexicon he ... the allegations and we had something that was almost plausible and then somebody else came in with something that was just so far out there that it ... the whole thing\nAnd you know as I look at this thing with Mueller there might be one\nJust so far out there that the whole thing\nAnd you know as I look at this thing with Mueller there might be one of them the credible and then they come up with a couple that are going to claim that were hay or something and the ... the a process\nIt's a good point that's a good boy good observation to heart\nWell it'll be interesting to see how the whole thing quite well yes it will\nThen on the citizenship I still think Trump has just made a master stroke here you take something that you know neither side and Congress really wanted to do anything about\nAnd\nHe put it into conversation and if he does do an executive order knowing full well that executive order won't hold up he could end up with the Supreme Court decision and that could result in Congress actually happened to do something rather than both sides on their hands because both of them are getting something out of the way things are\nI hear you my friend I I think he's weaponized executive order myself cargo unfortunately I Am amount of time for this brag so I've got the part raised with it but I Will tell you that I just looked at my Twitter feed and the man by the name of Jason just put it at first thousand bucks [laughter] we're all on the road [laughter]\nHey you know do you want to do something like that Michael\n... that touches my heart a truly does in fact you Jason I appreciate the offer as well\nTake care man\nYou take heart I wrote quite right coming right back side rabbi Eric Walker is going to join us it's interesting enough that it's Halloween and uh we've got some interesting conversations we're going to happen with him and then uh\nSo I'm just real weird stuff go to Bob Bob later on in today's broadcast you all stick around as do the Michael hearts are\nWe there are you to call the show and try to take him down hits the Michael heart show the following\nIt does not necessarily reflect the opinions or abuse of Crawford Broadcasting its employees affiliates or advertisers mom room\nThat was on the line and this year's elections this is just as Tom Parker you also how the leftist mob trying to tear down just as Kevin on\nThe move me to be next to have served for Thirteen Years on the Alabama Supreme Court honestly strong with independent conservative voice has taken on and beating the Southern Poverty Law Center and been outspoken that ruby weighed and all of them were wrongly decided\nAnd I'm a strong supporter of President Trump and his answers to put more conservatives don't are put into words the left his mom doesn't like that\nThey want judges who overturn our laws and look the other way when the left his mom who tries to destroy our society this is justice Tom", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Guys", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "31"}
