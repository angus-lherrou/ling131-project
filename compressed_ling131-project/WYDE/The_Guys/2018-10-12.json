having a son first hour you know as we are starting to show [noise] we have had a very intensive three weeks where we talked about a lot of in depth topics such as Supreme Court law and the waste in this year the committee's work and things of that nature so we decided on this Friday to have\nMore of a fun show to still talk about relevant news topics [noise] but to do so in a manner that was\nMore fun than just hitting you the facts about Brett Kavanaugh or what\nDr Christie and Bob the boards that or any of that stuff\nInstead we decided to talk about what happened with Kenya western Kenya west visited the White House yesterday we also so there are two items left on the agenda we've got to talk about Kanye visiting the White House talked about that this hour\nWe gotta talk about some laws that went into effect coming to a trick or treating which Dylan brought to my attention which will break down here shortly\nAnd uh the only thing other than that is for pretty much the whole first our somehow we got off on the subject of a ...\nAnd I'm daily horoscopes so if you're just tuning in this is not completely random this is not something we do every day we read about four of these live on air and I I have to say dealing what'd you say I Am\nCapricorn I think Capricorn\nCandy corn but whatever I'm so October twelve twenty Eighteen this is what it says for a Capricorn so I'm going to make a prediction I'm going to have a bigger rating conversation is that the phrase invigorating conversations stimulating stimulating same difference\nI'm going to have a stimulating conversation I'm going to need to go for a walk and I'm definitely\n... stimulating ah same difference I'm going to have a stimulating conversation I'm going to need to go for a walk and I'm definitely\nDefinitely definitely\nGoing to have some paperwork so I haven't read this how many of those do you think about it right to three\nWhich to any to\nNo that's not acceptable give me an answer they make them big enough and there's five point oh you know there are five points between off oh they pick and choose a random three for each one doing what two of the three will I have\n\nA conversation in a paper work the conversation the paperwork All right I'm putting my money down but I'll need to take a walk\nAnd do paperwork paperwork is definitely going to be in there we've had it on like three for three it's not not going to be in there so\nOctober twelve twenty eight team today you might decide to tackle your financial paperwork yes and get it all done so or one for one this is a great day for that Capricorn I still don't like how would addresses us such\nAs this is a great day for that Capricorn although you might be a little too ambitious and not get as much done as you'd like this is a good time to make use of any riding talent because ideas could be coming to you thick and fast\nTo students typically go together thick and fast except many expect many of letters or phone calls and this busy in stimulating day\nSo I think that we got the stimulating conversation in there and let me explain why it says expect many letters or phone calls if we take letters out of that 'cause nobody writes letters anymore does twenty Eighteen and we look specifically at phone calls that are\n[noise]\nWelcome back him in the wake up call ladies and gentlemen were talking about what happened with Kanye West yesterday when he went and he had to sit down at lunch with President Trump and the left lost their mind so the question was\nPosed does this have to do with the fact that he is a black man supporting a Republican candidate in a Republican president and the\nOnly reason I bring race into it is because I was not the first to bring race into a do you remember we talked yesterday about the comments that were made in which the N. word\nNot the one that's typically use but the word that means the colored black in Spanish was used by CNN commentators and referencing Kanye West going to meet with President Trump\nThey said this this is a quote they said quote this is what happens when they use that word don't read quote that was a former congressman Bacardi sellers\nThen you continue forward and there were more comments that were made using that word and so if the CNN commentators made a specific point to call out his race\nIs it because he is a black man that is agreeing with a Republican candidate eight six six\nFive five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation eight six six by five one Ninety nine thirty three let's go to William on line one William how you doing\nReal\nGood morning you're far away from a friend on the\nLittle man I it was cold here but not back old\n\n[noise]\nYou help 'em out [noise]

somebody like Candace ... says like that is her story essentially verbatim and she thinks she thinks that's exactly what's happening with John you at\nNow she's beautiful woman ... calm down that William oh dry [laughter] hey\nDid you say you're not going to tell us you know we all want to be family which is very ...\nYou know you still there ... all the game [noise] [noise] yeah [noise]\nYeah oh yeah I've seen the video oh yeah so but\nIt is an incredible but now he's ... he got booed for coming out and saying look I think this way but we disagree and we're all family you know we're we we can all have a civilized conversation about it when he just called for civilized conversation simply he got booed\n... you know you either you or your rent is just this\nBig hole [noise] [noise] yeah you're right because now what are the channel you know for quite\nA bit more if you listen to you listen to your\nAll right appreciate your brother always love it here in front of me\nYou know Slater days in St Louis park\nYour your mom and I appreciate it I\nYou do you have an awesome they All right eight six six by five one Ninety nine thirty three is a number to join the conversation we're talking about Kanye West White House visit yesterday and look I don't think on us is the most intelligent person on the planet but I Do think the last reaction\nTo him going and visiting the White House was it's just one of the most overblown and crazy things I've ever seen in its hypocritical based on their reaction when come crashing into the White House\nWhich I also didn't think I I don't think I knew was going White Houses productive nor do I think ... going to the White House was productive now due to get a sentence community in the case of Alan's Murray Johnson I Believe was her name uh yes it did and that needed to be done but\nThat in of itself was productive but I don't think having celebrities having regular conversations with the president is the most productive use of the time but we can all have different opinions eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three's enough to join the conversation let's go to anger carry on line to Gerry how're you\nWe can all have different opinions eight six six by five one Ninety nine thirty three and a number join the conversation was going to end your carry on line to Gary how you doing this morning\n[noise] what was going on by what was going on and I haven't heard from you in a while\nI may you know what I'm saying you know man you know trying to get to the job and tried to ...\nI'd rather how ya doing work you know 'cause I Do work you know you conservatives will talk about is you know there's a little boy\nI work in June slows down somewhere else where I Am ticked off\nYour ticked off white ticked off\nLa la la la la la la la la la mama\nOh no not irritate dog conservatives when they talk like that are ticked off yeah gotcha Dallas let's talk about gay guy\nWhite folks why post listen to them it don't info about okay so what's up this way of trying to sell what he's trying to sell records obviously\nYou want to talk about the vows this car will kill themselves ever since he went online meal I'm telling you know all of a sudden there's a big deal to him that\nMan trying to sell that\nI think he's very valid only\nAs long as she wanted him that song clay may\nKinky yeah look what can't cut gas didn't you know that's what I've seen the conspiracy theories about that\nLast two years later I'm trying to figure out what James is not a slam the mole Beyonce is not going to be talked hanging with Kim ... last year in mhm she's a she's a\nDie give yourself censoring you know what I'm saying\nBut I definitely think he's trying to sell records like I I'm not disagreeing with you at all\nHe saw all the time they tried to do is like hey look it didn't even when I'm o\nO P when I'm not sure where where do you care yep you know he just trying to pick people up when he tried to take the black widow you know but I'm told him I I'm doing my age we're looking at 'em like me you quite easy will swallow tool\nBut how many times have we and and just going from your perspective right how many times have we talked about Kanye West in the past month to month as opposed to how much we had talked about them in the past two months for probably the past\nFour to five years prior like I think we talked about Kanye West in the past two months far more than we have in the past four to five years\nLists where he will start going there and he ... with the ... you know when he hooked up with a kill crash\nThe car to ask you in terms of a kitten I listed shape as out if he would have been ... you know that'll be the one thing but\nWhen he may kill Jay Z cut him off and I believe Jaycee wife\nMade him do it [laughter] problem to have somebody to pull in black people date or be well nobody is going to make them look bad\nBecause you you think I think that'd be nice dream Portland regardless of race but now listen ...\nOkay let me hold you over we got to go to a break the amount of old job okay yeah yeah sure I appreciate your brother will come back to the second don't go anywhere ladies and gentlemen line from ... sitting in our studios Alabama license one love and twenty cents a wakeup call [noise]\nThat's the last we go listen to a man give me a boring you know what I'm saying I'm toilet is he taking those minutes\nI don't think anybody's ever been listening to Kanye though like his music definitely but in in like in regards to how you live how to live your life or socially or politically I don't think anyone's ever been listening to ...\n... ... you know this is you know what I'm saying is is it's just like I just thought it was just real personal you know he he's just trying to do with Jay Z it and you know and everything and stuff and you know and and now you're trying to show them each enemy of the trial\n... ... ... you know and stuff and you know and it just ain't gonna work you know what I'm saying you know up to that I don't know about a believe\nYeah you know\nYou think it's hypocritical um the way that the liberal media\nHas gone after him so quickly and I don't when I say liberal media I don't mean the entirety of the mainstream media I mean specifically CNN and MSNBC do you think they didn't go after ... talking about the same exact topics they actually praised her\nBut then when Kanye West as they go after him do you think that's a bit hypocritical\n[noise] um you know we know that can uh\nThat hypocritical [laughter]\nUm you know we know that can ... you know just a girl you know as a party girl so like we're not going to really take well I'm trying to like what does she know about physical so yeah you know\nShe got she got Asbury Johnson sentence commuted though\nIt was you know what I'm saying listen would also say that it wants you to hold that prisons hall well\nWhen you do we need to hold all we need to go down the pike shop agent uh oh boy they poke chop the employee has a ... that's what we need as critical for cancer they ask you\nDo you have an address report job\nI'll look I Will say well I'm Sorry I T Mobile\nListen I'd like to have a hard job anti mobile on the program so if you can give me some addresses well we'll talk about prison reform\nAnd say hey we'll ... we'll put it might have been locked up man\nAs long as I Am for it works out in the mobile type stuff as long as they pork chop in the mobile\nI Know a ... I Will get you shop AT T mobile may thank you carry talk you know what I'm saying hey look and they will talk while what about be locked up doll\nSounds passed it will be like scared straight or will it be like a conducive conversation\nI looked at him and I'm right below skittish grade [laughter]\nIt'll do this but the little salt involves\nBest to do it on the phone okay occupied in mind [noise] I'll use the mobile recall the mobile\n[laughter] well I look at it I got a little clock here and uh we got one face clock if it was certainly the man you know it won't take my place right off the\nBat you\nMay say well hey look I'll take care of me\nI appreciate scary thanks so much I God Bless\nAll right eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation again we're talking about Kanye West done\nI just I really do think it's hypocritical and do you think that\nCarry had a point when he was saying\nThat the reason people weren't really up in arms and came crashing and did it and when she was able to actually get something done they praise or is because they didn't have any expectations for her going in right they just thought she was a party girl kind of a a cart actually in quite literally or end with Kanye West they had a higher expectations for him do you think that\nThat's the case or do you think they're kind of on a similar playing field\nI think they're on different levels because of how they became stars also all Kanye did his a little more honestly yeah there and is a little more relevant than cameras\nYeah but I get that intellectually\nThere on the same level I Believe in socially there on the same level I mean I don't see why Kanye would be an elevated social or intellectual status in comparison to Kim I think they're pretty synonymous in that regard\nOwe\nHim is famous for why she's famous I think everyone knows why that is if you don't ... it's not hard to find out uh\nHey do we have any rage a in the system I don't think so okay cool just checking\n\nKanye is he's kind of made his own controversy off and on over the years like the one you're I think it was the Grammys yeah that he cut off Taylor Swift yeah\nThat's not like an intellectual thing\nOften on over the years like the one year at I think it was the Grammys yeah that he cut off Taylor Swift\nYeah but that's not like an intellectual thing like I get it I think maybe his star power extends longer and higher than Kim's right I totally get that but I don't get ... I I don't get why that makes them has to be the social justice warrior\nAnd this political thinker I think maybe that's the ideal we have as a society that's so wrong is these people that are good at music or good acting we expect them to be good at everything and let me just tell you as somebody who's talk to people that are both in music and in Hollywood\nAnd I mean you don't even have to listen to me just go on Twitter and look at people like Lena Dunham\nI mean they're not the sharpest tools in the shed they're really really really good at what they do but that doesn't mean they're really really really good at everything\nYou disagree\nI wouldn't say is good at what he does ... Bob honestly I've never like I've never liked his music okay now\nThere's a hot take I think ... music was good back in the day I think it's really weird now when he was just always been ever rated he had a whole song where he was like who did the scoop\nOr something like that I don't know I thought I was talking about picking up a doll crap in the backyard\nWho did a scoop scoop up the poop\nI created a rap song that's popular now a scoop up to ... put it in a bag a scoop up to ... see I'm telling you I could I could be rapper eight six six five five one\nNinety nine thirty three we're going to get into what after the next break don't\nCan't stop me from trick or treating yup Dylan's going to be that creepy old guy that's out trick or treating but now he could apparently get arrested find out more after the break a six foot five five one Ninety nine thirty three don't go anywhere in the wake up call\nYou're listening to the wake up call\nRaised in Alabama educated at John Carroll Sanford university you a big and Birmingham School of law you've seen my face off thousands of billboards but did you know that over twenty five thousand of your neighbors have trust me when they needed help the most\nThat's what I'm thankful for I'm Alexander ...\nA man for the people I Want to be your attorney call me Alabama representations\nMaintenance quality legal services to be reformed screen and there was a lot of lawyers [noise] [noise]\nForty of 'em the Ford faction stay traditions as the original\nState inspired apparel companies they offer upscale casual clothing including shirts hats outer wear\nTies shores and accessories was subtle stage civil West I'm guessing you probably want to represent our great yellow hammer steak real hammer supply company has a great mix of shirts in jackets and even work out for that was a subtle yellow for that we all know\nStay tradition can be found at the summit in between movies Pulitzer into sky [noise]\nDo you want to melt fat and get him didn't have the body you've always wanted then you need to check out iron try fitness through high intensity interval training and nutrition education I can help you trends sat and gain muscle\nIrons rather currently looking for forty locals who want to participate in a free six weeks challenge that is guaranteed to get the results [noise] with that challenge you hit accustomed meal plan\nPersonal accountability grocery list and so much more as long as you read your home late the challenge is absolutely free\nContact your closest tries today to find out more spring the whole family out just how are they the way for they can be I'd be a serious while but not as if she was from a number of great opposite side of the white guy garage tours pre made photo after more\nA race is a salad ... guess shows us just to just the ...\nA race to sell a Degas\nShows talk radio has to stick to just the era where you can find out about what's coming up what's going on or what you miss wife following at one super station on Twitter forcibly go to Facebook dot com and search for super restriction\nWonder why why do you can take us wherever you go to the super ... ... it's like having your own personal news anchor more\nThat's not creepy and all your home town got an countries they should be a super station one oh one nobody Whitey\nRecently on the Michael ...

G forces ten times those that are on earth this according to new science Popular Mechanics describes ballistic re entry and steep and short compared to the long flight profile of a control dissent\nThe good news is a re entry was successful so certainly are up\nAre accolades are props to both the astronaut and the guy's not or in this case just the two astronauts\nBut that's pretty much all the news I feel like talking about today because it's all pretty much the same\nWeather is really nothing out there I mean now CNN is saying uh we shouldn't say the word mob anymore\nBut at the same rate you got panels on CNN call and Kanye West and ignorant you know a right and blah blah blah blah blah and Don Lemon lemon is saying that the meeting with Trump ... Trump was a minstrel show\nI guess harkening back vaudeville yeah with the pain that face a\nUsed or where the eye of the war with an\nE\n\nBecause I I feel quite certain given the opportunity Don Lemon with appropriate language of give up or to energy\nOh the um\nWhen the panel is talking yeah they they use the uh the Spanish worth what yeah and\nI don't mean that I'm Talking about is it minstrel or menstrual\nOh like like a ... year old okay I Know not not the the the feminist version of it not not that one um and I mean Fox News headlines really aren't that much different BBC had one really aren't that much different the\nOnly thing interesting or\nThat proves our point about how weak the British Government it is and why they shouldn't have the gun laws they do is the story about the police inspector who locked himself in the car when his buddy was being stabbed to death on women's to bridge yeah yeah so\nYeah then there's that um they need a new Churchill over there\nYou know it's interesting because ... and I've been promising and even threatening to do this\nFor office huh run for office now clean my office but I've been threatening to start some kind of a podcast and all over the years\nPeople have asked me about pod casting the program at the other words I guess what some folks want us to do was take certain segments of the show and just put them on line that was never that appealing to me I don't even like rebroadcast of the show\nBut since the book has gotten a lot of support it's been very successful even have a a rather large bookstore chain which has expressed interest in doing some book signings we have one scheduled for a week from tomorrow at the second and Charles in Hoover which is a bookstore is not a clothing store\nBut it's right there across the street from the Galleria and will be their lives signing copies of unknown America from eleven until one so you have an African to come out just a bookshop in great place to do Christmas shopping as well so we'll be out there talking politics talk at a note America\nBut I wanted to do a pod cast was related to unknown America and go long form with it and probably do it for maybe an hour to two hours a week maybe three hours a week and take the stories that are in the book\nAnd expand an elaborate on them 'cause most of the stories the mess that we the bunk and the book about American history there a paragraph or two law because we're trying to get as much in there's we can because going back to a hundred and forty years as you can roll imagine I had a lot\nThe bunk and the book about American history there a paragraph or two long because we're trying to get as much in there's we can because going back to a hundred and forty years as you can roll imagine I had a lot of material to choose from I didn't want to create an encyclopedia and I was on a collision course to do that\nSo I thought is that right the second edition of unknown America let's go ahead and do a pod cast and elaborate on the stories in the first edition of the book and people can listen in and you know it'll be a recorded thing you can download and listen to your convenience\nAs I'm going through this process and undecided or it's going to be hosted and what time is going to be hosted it what does it look like but I thought you know I really want to get my head around the best way to present this material\nAnd so I've been listening to broadcast on which I'm not really a big podcast fan\nBut I've been listening aligned trying to get my sea legs about me about because I Want the quality of the audio and the way it's presented because there's a lot of 'em out there that are just one of the most popular ones is called ... town it couldn't be more dry and there's other ones out there with his water production or elements but I found one yesterday\nI Want to say it's called one thousand one history or whatever\nAnd I decided to tune in and see what these guys are doing because it's a product of the BBC\nNow this particular pod cast on history is not just about British history it's about worldwide history with the slant towards written in the early days\nAnd I'm listening yesterday and the the export was the guy who's written books about the revolutionary war the relationship between the Brits between England and America\nA what would have happened if America because America almost did surrender New York city New York Manhattan proper during the revolutionary war what impact that would have had on our relationship blah blah blah\nI'm a taste something going back to what you just said about Churchill\nWhen it comes to the revolutionary war\nBritish historians or bought her [laughter]\nI mean this guy it was thirty minutes of whining\nAbout how the Brits lost the war against the United states how they should have taken New York and I was still to this guy going good grief you need to run for US Senate on the Democrats' side please and I just I don't do this I was going all these years later you know I've had people call this program\nAnd it hasn't happened recently but it might happen today if I say this is where I have referenced people like Abraham Lincoln and I actually had one caller\nThat you know very well on the air and off give me though what for\nBecause quote we don't like Lincoln\nAnd we never like lake and and they give me this diatribe of things that Lincoln did and he's a terrorist and Williams assure members of tears I get all that but there are people that here in two thousand and eight team will look back to the era of the civil war and speak of it as though it happened two years ago mhm\nYeah kind of coming sided went with Trump's election but it it's so funny to me and then was podcast and most of this and it's these these old British historian says like nothing you and I were talking about you that most to be the uh yeah yeah those are the Americans they they they should have ... you know and I'm just going\nOh my gosh why don't you guys just pop a bottle of the jolly delete delete and get on with your lives\nAh Oxford's not groups it's just a little five ... oh my gosh [noise]\n[noise]\nYeah ... ... you can't can't live with and can't shoot well actually it is a kind of did yeah both of them yeah\n... mhm you can't can't live with them can't shoot well actually I did uh did you vote for him you know they're all you know what Canadian for them\nTo close yeah yeah yeah yeah it's funny that they [laughter]\n\nI was in this thing\nThat I thought well that was a waste of thirty minutes and it wasn't because of just what he was saying it was just the way it was format it 'cause I'm trying to get some form of an idea this was something will be announces on the Facebook page and coming weeks\nBecause it's something I've wanted to do for a long period of time working which for some of these things and somewhat of a long form or fashion but again I was ... and I'm just thinking you know we think that so much of the ... and anger and and all the opposition that we see\nIs right here in America no no no no no it was pretty vibrant across the globe and there's ... there are a lot of people out there like I said they're just completely bought her about what happened in the ... the Seventeen hundreds scores you know\nAnd how you you lay the these accusations out there that are unsubstantiated you know for example roe versus Wade will be overturned immediately here we are no Kavanaugh's first week no mention of roe versus Wade whatsoever we really didn't think there would be no no the Supreme Court will pay that off anytime in the near future\nBut how how similar was with the accusations from people like him all Harrison Spartacus and Dianne Feinstein in a whole bevy of mothers and the the rhetoric is almost identical so it's it's it's a strategy that you know has not really taken root with the anti gun radical\nAt least in terms of those ... you know and I knew about that of a trash can lid and it didn't take root with the cabinet confirmations\nNo no but I mean unfortunately some people will fall for it but for the most part anybody who's thinking\nLogically and who critically thinks this stuff at least one layer deep you know I have a I have a Nineteen year old son and he is he's a he's a brilliant kid and I don't know I don't know how it happened but he just is and what he says he goes dead you know I watch this I watch these\nPeople get so angry on the left and ... and they they fall for the the the instant gratification of going along with the um the hateful narrative or or whatever he says they don't think\nTo the next level or the next layer he said they're just single layer thinkers and they go along with whatever is spoon fed to them\nAnd I said yeah you know you're right because we actually at our house we have conversations at the dinner table we critically think this stuff through when we go through layers and we say okay so what's what's gonna happen if that takes place why do they think that what's the cause of that thought process how are these people being influenced\nOn on that particular topic we talk about this stuff\nWhereas most people just watch the uh\nYou know they they they're they eat whatever's on the menu\nUh that comes from a left wing media and most often the food is full of maggots\nYeah and it's very interesting you know that you bring that up because the the the\nNarrative on the second amendment has been so consistent in recent years and it's so unbelievably obvious to anybody that pays attention to it so give us a little bit of the ... I Love the fact that you pointed out things might like buzz words and phrases allergies so give us a little bit of an idea memory having these conversations\nBecause it it's so interesting to me and even in a conversation with a hammer the I'm One of my ... a weekly regular guest name was ... was on yesterday and we were talking about how\nYou know when you have conversations with liberals\nIt's hard to have a conversation with a liberal because they are sort of steeped\nIn their beliefs and you know when the conservative side we can argue we can debate and do whatever but the liberals they get off western they raise their voices they start repeating the same kind of raise our the over and over so give us a little bit of an idea if we do in gauge a liberal in this conversation [noise] what kind of responses might we hear from them\nWell okay let's start with let's start with what we can start with assault weapons um that term assault weapon and they are\nBut yeah and they what happened with assault weapons is interesting and if you go back into the nineties you'll see a Dianne Feinstein holding up a A R\nOf a ... right style rifle and calling it an assault weapon and this is what they started to do in the nineties I started to bring that term into a into the public forum and just for the purpose of scaring people\nAnd the nineties I started to bring that term into a into the public forum and just for the purpose of scaring people assault weapon is a scary term and you know so what they did was they brought that and they use that term all the time now\nMany people have many different definitions of of assault\nWeapon it could be a semi automatic which which now they're trying to deem assault weapons it could be a fully automatic it could it could have a pistol grip or a or a skull or\nA extended magazine or you know any any different number a number of different things that that that could be determined that assault so there's no real definition of assault weapons and most of the time people don't know\nBut people to throw that term around don't really have a solid definition so I asked him I say just so we're clear\nAnd I know what we're talking about could you define assault weapons for me\nAnd they never can because they hear these terms and they're like trained puppies and they go out and they repeat it and and and they're scared of the term and they scare their friends with the term and and the media scares everybody it's just it's all just a a big propaganda\nOr you know I'm attempt and it's a big anti gun landscape that they create\nSo so that's one of the things you know if you want a response I just ask them\nWhat do you mean and when you ask them put them on the other end of the question they they have to search for answers and they don't ... they often don't have them so it's a way of a rather than getting into the debate because we're always getting a debates about statistics and all this stuff and gun owners do this all the time it's it's it's a lot easier if you just ask them what they mean\nWell you know it's interesting that you bring that up because you know a lot of folks might not be familiar with the terms so crowded method\nAnd of course you know that as a reference to Socrates and you know back in the day obviously you know many many many many years ago\nYou know when when Socrates was engaging people in in thought or he was teaching or you know he was trying to make a point he would very often times answer a question from\nWhere the question and he would force people to answer the question then he asked as opposed to engaging in debate because you know you and I and and I'm like in did you know here in the state of Alabama\nTo the ... between ... in Alabama fans and although you know these debates have been going on for decades in the state you're not going to change their mind in Alabama fan but you're not going to change their mind them in Auburn fan you know these are two different bases the people\nThey have their own beliefs they have their own desires they have their own fan who if you will not support other teams\nNow a lot of it's just fun and funny and it's kinda kinda silly here during football season has been um Alabama but it's pretty much light hearted at the same time but in a sense of a gun ownership in usage it's a lot more heated obviously\nBut when you turn the question as you point out back to them in the form of a question asking them in this case you know what a A R is and they have no response it forces them to do something that they haven't previously done\nWhich is think about why the way they think they think\nYeah yeah exactly and like I said at our kitchen table at our dinner table we do this to each other and my family and me and my wife my son and myself and I was just a New Yorker and you\nMay be but it's you know it helps you understand\nLife you know and and raising kids and sometimes it's better it's most often better for people to think for themselves and explore their own thought process and find their own beliefs on these things and you know I mean the truth\nBut er it's most often better for people to think for themselves and explore their own thought process and find their own beliefs on these things and you know I mean the truth is our brains are problem solving devices when were presented with a question our brains instantly take action to try to solve that question or that problem\nAnd when you put your\nAccuser or your your um your the person who's trying to shut you down when you put them on the\nOther ... other end of a question you'll you'll put them back on their heels and if you notice when you're watching you know the CNN debate rate actually any news or\nYou know show you the the the the host never likes to answer questions because they lose control of the conversation that way when they're on the back end of the question\nSo if you know I remember Megan Kelly was asked a question by a guest who who was aware of this process and she said I'm asking the questions right yeah wouldn't answer because she didn't want to be put on that on the back end of it she didn't want to be put on our he'll she didn't want to she wanted to hold control that conversation\nRight then I Would take a real quick break and I could you hold on for a couple of minutes sure thing we're not come back the other side I Want to talk just a bit about some of these questions because I think that's a brilliant thought on your point and certainly a way to engage the uh the anti gun or left a little bit more than we have in the past I Want to go a little instructional on the other side\nWe're having a conversation with Dan ... author of good gun bad guy and good gun bad guy to you listen to the Michael hard church stick around\nWe ... call the show I Try to take him down the Michael heart show\nHoney that's a beautiful picture but\nDo you make the roof to different colors must not
