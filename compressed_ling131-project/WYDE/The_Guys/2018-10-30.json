immigrants born on us soil\nHe's planning to do this three executive order of some sort or potentially move it through Congress this is unconstitutional without a doubt this is by far the worst move the Trump Administration has made to date\nSo Donald Trump would just hurt enact CEOs clip if you're joining us on Facebook Live then you didn't hear the actual split because we can't pipe that audio into the face booklet however\nIf you did not hear that clip is simply what Donald Trump said is verbatim ... is not verbatim butter paraphrase as I Am going to use an executive order to take away birthright citizenship that is what he said\nI Am going to use an executive order to take away\nBirthright citizenship that's what he said so is that constitutional no\nThe fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution\nStates all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states in the states where they reside no state shall maker enforce any law which salad bridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United states nor shall\nAny state deprive a person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor denied to any person would end its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law again\nPay close attention to all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens\nOf the United states yet the president of the United states has the intention\nHis words not mine of passing a constitutional amendment\nThat says specifically that he's going to take away birth right citizenship\nBirthright citizenship isn't incredibly unconstitutional this is without a doubt the worst move the Trump Administration has made\nThroughout its an tire tenure\nThis will not stand this will be appealed to the Supreme Court and will be overturned this is not a partisan view this is not a political view what this is is specifically\nFive radio

the wakeup call ladies and gentlemen we're talking about Donald Trump's blatantly unconstitutional move to essentially revealed the fourteenth amendment and take away birthright citizenship how the hell will determine who's a citizen and who's not\nBeats me but he says he's only going to apply it to the case of illegal immigrants but that makes no sense because the constitution stipulates any body\nThat it's subject to the jurisdiction there of of the United states anybody that subject to the law the U.S which is any one in the U.S legally or illegally\nRight green card older citizen that he is going to\nTake away the ride a birthright citizenship I I don't understand how he could do it I think this is going to be the worst move the Trump Administration has ever made you think that the travel ban fall out when he targeted people coming from Muslim countries is bad\nDoes is oh my gosh this is going to be awful but don't believe me listen to this broken an hour ago an X. dot com here's the audio again\nAll immigration some legal scholars believe you can get\nBelieve me listen to this broken our going Axios dot com here's the audio again [noise]\nOn immigration some legal scholars believe he can get rid of the ... citizenship without changing the constitution and executive order exactly right or have you thought about\nThis tell me all it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member guessing line and you don't need a number one number one you don't need that number I mean nothing to do with that very much into well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits it's ridiculous it's ridiculous\nAnd it has to end um have you talked about that with counsel yeah I have to wear in the process in the process that will happen with an executive order that's what you're talking about it but I knew I was thinking about I didn't think anybody but knew that but me I thought I was the only one China is a good guess good Deborah [noise]\nThis is unconstitutional\nWithout a doubt\nThe implications of it are also somewhat terrifying ... because if he can ... depending on how the executive order is worded and emphasize on the books and is not thrown out by the Supreme Court\nThis isn't just limited to immigrant children job or how\nIt could be applied to anyone born in the U.S ...\n... ...\nTo legal residents who were born here themselves in our citizens\nBecause you know anyone that's born here is illegal resident I mean\nI\nI Do think that there should be some change about if both of your parents or hear it completely illegally there should be something there about it but being over here on green cards being every year\n\nIn any way shape or form that is legal if you went through the process your children born here should be citizens\n\nI I tend to side with the fourteenth amendment that\nRegardless do I think it's right of people to come over here and have kids now but the fourteenth amendment clearly states all persons born or naturalized in the United states are subject and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states in the states were in there that is absolutely baffling\nThat or is it shocking know did I ever think we'd hit this point no\nEight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three has got these phone is going to max on line one Mac how you doing\nGood morning the morning you know like you I Hope you are too I'm doing well\nAh what take this as a sign that a trope of Jeff Sessions are now\nA on\nBetter contact or on closure or this is something that Jeff Sessions was advocating long before and uh your position that is going to cost a look twice won the election I think is incorrect\nThought I could potentially hello I'd never a certain that it would but there is about yeah I'm a split over there\nAnd then potentially hello I'd never certainly than it would but there is about I'm not you know that and\nWe're not going to split hairs over there my points that I'm trying to make\nYou'll let me is that I think the vast majority of people in this country we'll heartily approve of it\nAnd it is ridiculous but somebody could come to this country drop a kid and that kid becomes a citizenship we have a whole class of vacation is now\nAnd I understand is Filipino Chinese primarily that are taking advantage of mostly taken advantage of it but it's happened in from all over the world and it is ridiculous\nAnd I think go go Donald Trump go\nIf you have a kid here so there'll be a citizen yes I Am a citizen okay if you break the law and you know the kids shouldn't ... if you break the lawn you go to prison and you have a kid here should it be a citizen and somebody in prison has a child should it be a citizen\nOf yes that child will be a citizen\nOf all that's on the ground there um analogy I mean\nOf of whatever countries those people were from they are citizens just not at the United states\nOkay so I'm a child is born here right at the child is born here and you never been anywhere else is it a citizen of that country is it from that country or was it born it has it's been it's entire life in the United states\nIt doesn't make any difference how he does because what are we gonna do deported back in that country that has never seen never been to\n\nI mean what the hell are they the child never been there and where are you going to send it\nYou're calling it a deep deportation ah it's not as a repatriation of their home country and not for that were born I was born in Cuba\nI was not a Cuban citizen my father was stationed in Guantanamo Bay ... he will eat my mother down there and he planned to immigrate yeah but Castro changed all that mhm and uh and I have a Cuban\nA birth certificate well it's not really a Cuban birth certificate but it was as says Cuba ... uh where I was born but I was born a citizen of the United states even though I was born outside of the United states\n... uh and uh\nJust because that's where I was born doesn't mean I'm a citizen of Cuba\nI Will know legions of not guaranteed and any Cuban constitution and the government of Cuba is nowhere parallel to the government of the United states and they were born in a military confines which has to do with a nominee sovereign ground with the United states but\nIt it's not a question of moral equivalency of the types of governments or the the ups and downs of any different political system that is not the issue the issue is if you are an American and you'd have a child outside of America\nThat child is still with American citizen\nIf you're a Chinese or pick a country it doesn't have to be on it doesn't matter Mexico China can but it doesn't matter if you have a kid\nIn America that kid is gonna be a citizen of the same countries that you're a citizen\nOf period so if a child born here I'm just trying to make sure I get this right so if a child is born here said they were\nI Will just answer the question if it just talking so worked up an answer the question if a child is born here and knows nothing else other than this country not a citizen [noise]\n[noise] makes sense but what I'm saying is from a legal perspective that is the case\nAnd if you want to change the law changed law if you want to change the amendment amend the constitution but right now the constitution is crystal clear um and I think an hour or ... or the wrong approach\nYeah I I Would agree on that that you need to go sit right routes change laws all that uh yeah that would be the best way to handle it\nYeah and again I'm not I'm not making it from a emotional standpoint I mean I I I'm with you I think it's a little bit asinine but I also think you know if a child born here and the constitution says it's a citizen in it and it was nothing else\nWhat are you supposed to [noise] I it's a very tricky subject I don't think you can send it back 'cause where are you sending it back to it's never been to where you're sending a quote unquote back to you know you have to do is we start whipping amendment where we're going to end up in the future yeah yeah\nWhere you're sending a quote unquote back to you know you have to we start whipping amendment where we're going to end up in the future yeah yeah I mean yeah very true Josh I mean this is this is this is going to produce hell for the Trump Administration you think Sarah Sanders job has been tough\nUp to this point is you can earn money huh [noise] her paycheck huh [laughter] yeah she is rather hundred percent right on that I appreciate your moment or you have a good woman are you to God Bless All right let's go to Christie on line to Christie how you doing [noise]\nGood very good Kristy [noise]\nYeah I Would agree with that\nMhm mhm yeah\nMhm my mother\nAnd see that therein lies the question of what happens with the mother and that's why a lot of people claim chain migration and it's a valid claim you know somebody has a child here they get to stay here because of the fact that they believe that they I hate the term anchor baby but essentially what it's saying is they would the child have anchored themselves\nTo us soil um and it it's a it's a valid claim but I honestly just as the types of the law reads um\nYes child in the Marines under the Obama administration they are they were allowed to stay over here President Trump trying to crack down on that but yes parents were allowed to immigrate over here because they didn't want to separate families\n\n... ... thing that they have a\n... ... ...\nYeah I don't I don't think that they have a baby you have a baby\nAnd that's not you have to start the process to become naturalized yourself or get your green card and the right way yeah you're out of here\nYeah and that's something that I can get behind you know when I view this argument I view at the same\nAs abortion when somebody says a if a pregnancy comes about for some reason that isn't a you know the best of reasoning um or that the mother isn't able to support themselves are yadda yadda yadda what do we do\nThen I'm I kind of you at the same way as to why is this the kids' fault\nYou know what I'm saying is the kid didn't ask to be thrown in this I'm into this world when you know it it was either by the malfeasance of the parent or some other entity\nI'm so I'm not sure I'm not sure where to go there is a very touchy subject but I just I feel like we're putting a lot of blame on the kid in saying that we're going to take away a what the fourteenth amendment guarantees\nUnderstand likes to do it if you're going to get where they have said it was it just to sit in here lately it all the benefits everything not have to do\nLong it was it about here lately it all the benefits they not have to do anything yeah you have said per se a American\nYourself or your ... your child yeah\nAnd I mean that you're out ... as they get back when they're of age\nNow here's a question for you um would you be okay if they do not pursue the route and this was this is just not as question a conversational have if they don't pursue the quote unquote correct route right they don't\nGet the green guard they don't do that um if the parent is deported could the child that you're in the foster care system because it is a United States citizen\n... and that's the only other option in and out of the\nBoard that you know you are an American unfortunately your prayers it won't change here to allow that so I guess\nIf I did something that Brett ah well and I went to Princeton macho ago J. foster sister that stuff that that your parents know knowing what would happen to you unfortunately it might be better in the long run that they are in foster family hey\nWhat the law you can't let the kids yeah you know and then\nThere was going to follow the law yeah\nAnd see the the the thing with that is a it's the same question with that with family separations at the border now a conservative seal its if your parents go to prison right you can't go to prison with them\nSo if you're an American citizen and your parents committed a crime and coming over here legally and your parents were deported should you be deported within should you should suffer the consequences of their mouth seasons\nYou know but at a mid\nAir and if I Am an American I broke the law much out but yeah if I did not have my husband he would get your hair yeah\nAnd I would not knowing you know I'm an adult I Know that it happened\nI proceeded to break committed a crime that I was going to go to prison I I'm Sorry you know\nI think are going to talk about it is a hard decision to make you know it's not a it's not an easy decision ... but I appreciate is Christie ... what\nAre you to God Bless eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three we got one slot open up the phone lines will get to the rest of your calls when we come back

snopes\nWell on the ah right in this morning I heard a several people contact you Baylor and a voice their opinions about Donald Trump's threats to a\n... by suspend the fourteenth amendment override the fourteenth amendment and you know go in the air if you remember that you made the comment that it's a it's a difficult conversation to have because when you get in and I'm Talking about the legalities of it all\nBut here's the ironic thing and of course you know we're talking about birthright citizenship in this case and we've got other stories when it covered today and your calls are welcome\nAt eight six six five five one nine nine three three I don't know if you've dealt with it or not but I find this just to be a tattoo on the ironic side\nThat when it comes to the executive orders to the president he just cannot override an amendment whether you can do however is instruct agencies that one in four said amendment from the way they function in the way they're funded\nAnd then all of a sudden this goes in front of a back to Congress theoretically if we're going to have a vision of an amendment in this case the fourteenth and that could end up eventually end would in front of the Supreme Court considering the fact\nThat many people on the left are going to be quite vocal about this as it continues to gain legs throughout the day\nDo either one of you or even doing for that matter find it even remotely amusing that as a strict literal list of the United States Constitution that the one person most likely to throw a monkey wrench into this entire process\nAgainst the president would be Brett Kavanaugh\nThat that's exactly that's what I led with I said when I first broke the story I said this will be appealed to the Supreme Court and if you think Kavanaugh will vote for this like Democrats will say oh Kevin all over the Kavanaugh will\nAll of a sudden Kavanaugh becomes their greatest asset oh yeah oh yeah and just like that the world is redefined mhm\nThat's

to come in to share some really weird Halloween stuff kind of a redo from last year broadcast on Halloween friday gene allowed and was going to join us march broad frame and Steve was\nToday is the one day we had no gas plan to be with us at any stage of the program and I was a little bit concerned about what we're going to talk about\nToday and then Trump woke up and we're off to the races do\nThey play of the day as Donald Trump is now threatening to a override the fourteenth amendment do away with anchor babies in the United states and uh you know I have come down on the side\nOr the viewpoint so I'm Jeff Sessions for many years but it doesn't change the fact that they're bait for me isn't so much work to do with these kids by\nWhat the president's thinking the timing and is he feeling a little bit\n\nI'll just say emboldened but it seems like he is having a lot of uh forty well\nWell it's funny if you watch the ac CEOs video the uh the journalist is almost choking on the water he's drinking he's like so are you going to go forward with this birthright citizenship thing thinking the president's going to go no no no we never do that or even if so you know we're we're looking into it but probably not and he goes yeah we're going to do it and the guy goes\nAnd he literally just start smiling he's like there's no way I just got that on tape like\nThat a shovel look on his way out you know I went down the hall remember to go to get some coffee ran into a twice in the hallway and you know we were talking to you know this is really\n... in part a response to the care of a caravan pardon me which is looming\nAnd you know the fact that he is telegraph you and you're not going to get in or even if you get in your babies aren't going to be babies ... so you know they're they're they're just going to be mass deportations even if you uh find your way past the the border checkpoints but it is a very interesting constitutional conversation 'cause everybody's got their opinions\nThe problem is that even the jurors that have dealt with this over the last several decades\nThere's never been a resolution to it and so it's going to make court challenge after court challenge after court challenge but I can just see Donald Trump he is order happy there is no doubt about it he has got that pan out I mean he is going through sharp ... like a card dashing at a conference I'm a [laughter]\nA or a I'm not going there are\nAll right let's get out to the phones and we'll start where um Hey Ron how are you\n[noise] warning Michael Moore and uh and that's your thing okay for all think of something that I think you should just or blah I'm like your friends that earlier\nYou know just because they're so to jail it they'll go that's right but the parents they'll go to jail right on their hometown their\nJail um let's cable you know Bruce Lee Bailey was that he would allow him to come back and became a ...\nSo that's a problem on our resources guards to um\nYou know on this system\nSo let's get a a problem on our resources guards to um you know on this system\nHowever I'm sorry\nIf I'm gonna try to go on I may lose my kids I'm not going to go\nAt all I'm going to try not to lose my children you know what I'm saying and if you're gonna do it anyway and you don't deserve your children are better off without you better off here and\nThat's how I feel now the second thing I wanted to mention um you know I Love your show Michael I Love average show on this station man what's going on ... can I get along well\nSure there you go three zero three for a one one eight zero zero that's where our Colorado and in in the work so I think a copper is laying off\nAnd stand for this radio station not only that they're listening to this radio station ... a year at times\nBecause now you have to pay the bill itself just\nWell Ron ... where we appreciate we appreciate the support we appreciate the kind words and uh you know certainly you know I think you know a lot of ... are going to be some changes coming here at Crawford Broadcasting but you know you guys are law but just know that it's there are other things in the works that are\nWell may

you're both still need to get and still need to know the second one\nWhere we're working on the second one right now and the podcast is already scheduled to go live this upcoming Tuesday so just hang around what are we doing a live broadcast via the Internet and some of the things we're working on as well so we appreciate it very much my friend\nThank you yeah I actually cared you too and if you want to follow Michael hearts friend you can follow me on Facebook Baylor cook on the first thing that pops up thank you for using my airtime to promote you know\nI'm promoted you so much I Love you Michael I mean this together\nOkay back to this or maybe so if if children are born\nIn the United states so by the fourteenth amendment and all that good stuff\nThat child cannot be deported correct right okay but the parents can correct yes about average a month how much do we spend on each illegal person in the United states\nWell obviously that depends on benefits but it's ...\nInto the thousands okay so if they weren't to enforce that law a deporting the parents but not the children and created a massive massive federal orphanage if you will ... or boarding school\nAnd taught the children English and taught their children about American history and politics and law in math you know what kids civics what kids should be taught in school anyways now\nWould that be a bad thing even though their parents get the boarded they stay here and they actually\nWell I mean I actually ultimately the courts are going to fall to keeping the children and parents together so I guess you could make the argument that you know no matter how many goodies that they had you know children that you know the end of the day or a child in a in a\nDepressed household why that might not be economically secure cetera et cetera you know most of the colleges are going to make the argument the children is better off of the parents no matter what the condition of the children's living in\nI don't think so because the Ninth Circuit court was the one that started the family separations\nArgument but Joel is better off with the parents no matter what the conditions of Jordan's women him\nI don't think so because the Ninth Circuit court was the one that started the family separations at the border they're the ones that said the ... the children cannot\nBe talking with John talking about what what psychologists which I otherwise to young children don't want to be with us today is that you got a little child she's two years old her name as little Baylor do you really do think little Baylor would rather be a you know with Baylor's\nMom orders little goes hey look I'm getting a house or the hill she later lady I got a going on here I'm going to be an American citizen know Charles\n\nAnd then there's that and then there's that but you know to happen is we're gonna numbers you brought that up not going to have the means of all these little cute little girls dressed up as sexy cocktail waitresses for Halloween and they're going to be incarcerated becoming cages looking\nHere's the problem with your thinking is is the verbiage in the constitution\nThe road rage\nWell you know hey here's the problem with your thinking is is the verbiage in the constitution the robots for what the fourteenth amendment the fourteenth amendment is the verbiage in the fourteenth amendment in the constitution no there's no there's no fourteenth amendment\nIt's in the no rights but it's not in the constitution\nIt's not in the articles Henry now you're really splitting hairs\nWell I'm only going on now is that people who have put this in the action they argued themselves that are will\nHenry the question still remains is it in the constitution\nYou can argue us and you can argue or not you can argue yeah because it's in the constitution so how can something which is in the constitution be unconstitutional\nWell for her dissenting opinion or he argued that both like citizenship had been repealed by the principles of the American revolution and reject\nHenry ... you're the one that brought up the constitution and whenever anybody goes something unconstitutional or it's constitutional we've got to the fall to the constitution\nOkay but it's for legal legal citizens and the right\nTo their children to be automatic citizens was never in part on illegals\nIt Henry you still got to go back to the fourteenth amendment because if we can start to you surf the authority of the amendment then you start at at the same thing with all the other amendments at the same time and the bill of rights is part of the constitution that's why it's guarded amendment\nYeah and it was it was very important it was the only way we can repeal Dred Scott you know that\n[noise] so yeah it's in the constitution\nThank you I appreciate you devolve into the obvious\nThat you know what ... is you could argue that it is and there were too but you know most people would say that it's unconstitutional this is where do we split ... say that an executive orders are constitutional but it's in the constitution\nThe phrase now is the executive order does not actually appear in the constitution now the tennis and allow the president to make\nA act assigned to a bench order if you will now it certainly is but at the end of the day it doesn't change the fact that the constitution has to be amendment\nAmended by the Congress and the president can write all the executive orders he wants but the Congress does have the right to veto those orders and send it into the Supreme Court if need be and that's where this thing will end up\nSo that exact phrase allergy of an executive order it wasn't exactly in there it's just implied and I would\nArgue has pretty much and so is ah the the fourteenth amendment and every other are\nThe fourteenth amendment is not applied Henry oh hell to hear\nThe phrase allergy again I average splitting hairs I Know what we can say that when you ask me is it in the constitution and I said no that's what I was referring to is the fact that it had the exact plays out is not in there but yeah you can twist didn't than words and uh\nWhat what what phrase allergy is not in there\nThe fact that you can get like illegal alien\nHenry we're not talking about the ... the parents were talking about the child the fourteenth as clear that if you're born here in this country you are a citizen of this country you can argue that all day long but that's what the amendment says\nWell that uh there's one opinion that says and and I believe it's K. Mart a decision that a\nTenor yang goes in the Ninth Circuit court and poll opinions out of my or office all day long they did this\nAnd I believe it's Kim Clarke a decision that a\nTenor yang goes in the Ninth Circuit court and poll opinions out of my or off is all day long they did make them constitutional\nMental and all of these are the what made the fourteenth amendment constitutional was the fact that they argued it\nAnd it was ratified so there you have Henry I've I've\nIt wasn't it wasn't allowed for illegals it said it was it ... it was it held in that was true at you as\nA command or the ... of the fourteenth amendment and I know that is against splitting hairs but it was the last decision in Eighteen Ninety eight and it was an important decision because nothing since then\nHas been brought to the Supreme Court\nTo a distinguish between ... a citizen and shut up in a legal Elliana and other citizen so there's definitely been a ... or credit for since that Eighteen\nHenry the vomit you're having is it your hung up on the word illegal and the issue now becomes is a child born here are they themselves illegal by virtue of the fact that there are here under the wrong pretense\nOr the parent is under is is there in a state of limbo as you would say that they don't have a either a a destination or I'm what I'm trying to say is that the child than is it the same state as a parent until it's born right\nUntil I was born and that's why the amendment speaks to born here not conceived here not brought over here during term but born here\nShow the parrot now is in a state that is in a prison or in\nA headline and Henry ... we're going in circles\nBefore before you get onto sorry I just wanted to get before you went up to that a phone call the Indian citizenship active Nineteen twenty four addresses exactly what he document says I'm provided that all non citizen Indians born within territorial limits of the United states\nAnd they are here by declared citizenship in the United states it happens with Indians but it could be a potentially extended to people\nOf all creeds but with that one with the Indian and you also got the Jones Act which allows the planes Indians to travel freely between Canadian border and us border if they're born in Indian Territory in Canada they're automatically us citizens yep exactly so\nI mean it's I mean do you can go round and round this is going to be debated all the time John ... Chapman University Center for constitutional jurisprudence\nSo the constitution has been this applauded for over the past forty years he says the lawn subject to the dirt jurisdiction there of\nOriginally referred to people with full political allegiance to the U.S green card holders and citizens but then if you go down and you look at judge James see whoa who was appointed by Trump to Fifth Circuit court he said that if anyone tries to change the fourteenth amendment and how it's applied with executive order it is unconstitutional\nOkay take it to the extreme under the jurisdiction there up\nAn illegal come to America and engages in some kind of drug trade and violate the federal law and has picked up then is arrested are they under the jurisdiction of this nation mhm yes so the parents even if they're illegal are here and by virtue of the fact that they're illegal\nDoes that not prove that they're under the jurisdiction of the United states because they violated our law\nThe only people who are not under the jurisdiction of the United states once they stepped foot on us soil which includes territory or diplomats that's because they get diplomatic immunity\nAmount of community because they're not under the jurisdiction and yet just like with the second amendment we're back into the hair splitting of what the verbiage means\nI mean it's like people forget the gate silent\nNot under the jurisdiction and yet just like with the second amendment we're back into the hair splitting of what the verbiage means\nI mean it's like people forget the Kate Steinle case that was an illegal immigrant or the girl was that well found not guilty of murdering a girl that was still indicted on it and still brought to bear under our judicial system is under the jurisdiction of our law but\nAlso here's the question can you just finish the sentence for me Michael amendment to the what constitution yeah yeah so the verbiage isn't the\nEight six six five five or nine three three come right back\nYou don't have to agree with Michael heart you can choose to be wrong if you do it might go show\nThe following it does not necessarily reflect the opinions or abuse of Crawford Broadcasting its employees affiliates or advertisers\nLast night yeah has taken banks that side making Moscow say say when I go to school and I only see not saying ... ... the deputy by paying deputies in all the things in that county school said hell has given me and my classmates our own guardian angel I'm only twelve so I Can't that I sat down\nBut I'm asking me to death for I mean\nOur children are so precious and they deserve to be site\nEvery day when they go to our gift these are carefully selected and trying to help provide our children and schools would support and attention they need ... does it know political parties and criminals don't care about race or gender when I was first elected you're sure if I made only one problem is to keep your neighborhoods and your school say\nI'm Mike hail and I'm proud to help protect our two oh November six I'm asking you reelect me\nYour share paid for by the sheriff Mike hell reelection committee ... box to six nine trust will Alabama revive one seven three\nThe following it does not necessarily reflect the opinions or views of Crawford Broadcasting its employees affiliates or\nAdvertisers paycheck you know del marsh del marsh the conservative running for the state Senate yeah ... well\nI've been thinking oh I think del marsh and I talk a lot of light yeah how's that ... altered the largest tax cut Alabama seen in a decade yeah and that tax cuts can save people off pot load of money that is true on top of that\nDon't marsh helped pass legislation to dramatically cut down the size of government said Minnesota uh another hundred million a year\nSo what you're saying is del mar say do you and the rest of Alabama a whole lot of money that's what I'm saying and you both believe there's better ways to spend your money then to give it to the governor's factly good so you won't mind picking up the check for breakfast I like this new ... you know if you've dealt with a check just for\nLower taxes smaller government conservative del marsh for state Senate paid for by march for Senate PO box to three six five pedestal in Alabama three six to move to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Guys", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "30"}
