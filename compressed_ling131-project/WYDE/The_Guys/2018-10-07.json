it did with him and listen he's\nWe'll go to in touch with Dr Charles families and our continuing series on our return old destiny [noise]\nThose of us who are Christians ... is our destination [noise]\nMuch has been taught about our celestial home many articles and books have been written\nIn TV and movies portray of variety of ways\nHere in the Bible described a return home [noise]\nI Wonder why we don't say much about him\nMaybe it's because we don't know much\nMaybe it's because we're not too excited about going there yet you remember the little quip about the little boy in Sunday school and his teacher ask\nHow many of you want to go to heaven and everybody to raise their hand except one little boy and she says John and what about you you don't want to go to heaven he said oh I thought you were getting below to go now and I'm not quite ready [noise]\nBut I Want to tell you something to do a lot of believers on do not ready\nTo go to heaven in fact they like it so well here they're not very interested in having somebody says well think about that one of these days but not now so here's the whole purpose of this message the show you why you and I ought to be thinking about having preparing to go there\nSomebody says I got to say that I'm prepared no no that's the only part of the preparation is what I have to do besides get said well you don't have to do anything to get in but that's not all the preparation\nWe ought to be sharing Arab face not only with someone about the nature of the Senate God's forgiveness but the eternal home that God has provided for them\nWe all know enough to talk intelligent about what happens is all about usual I don't understand the book of revelation well the message I'm going to give you the day as you don't you don't even have to know the book of revelation\nThat knows some very important reasons you and I ought to be thinking about having talking about having having it on our mind\nAnd heart and sharing it with people who'd today are not going there\nWhy should you not be about heaven let me tell you the first reason first of all because our heavenly father is there it's interesting in the gospels\nThan in the sermon on them out four times in chapters five six and seven Jesus addressing the people who are as good as he said the ... my father who is in heaven our father who is in heaven the father who is in heaven\nFour times he mentioned that sermon Eighteen times in the gospel of Matthew alone Jesus reverse the father who is in heaven\nAnd when he gave us the pattern prayer how did he began that prayer he said that this is the way you pray our father who art\nIn heaven hallowed be thy name why would Jesus said so often and refer to the father as being in heaven\nBecause that is our eternal home that is our final resting place one of the reasons you and I ought to be thinking about heaven talking about it and sharing is that's where our heavenly father is the second reason that's where our savior is\nYou recall what he said in the sixth chapter John when he was talking with the ... the ... and they were arguing with him listen to what he said he made it very clear where he came from he says the thirty first of all he says I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me he says I came down from heaven\nYou remember what the angel said to the apostle standing there when Jesus was sending he said what do you spend your gazing up in the sky this same Jesus\nYou remember what the angels said to the apostle standing there and when Jesus was sending he said why do you stand here gazing up into the sky\nThis same Jesus who you have seen as sin show so come in like manner which means\nThat he ascended visibly and physically he's coming back to visit ... and physically\nAnd the Bible says he is that the fathers right hand ... chapter to see it as if all goes right hand and in Romans chapter eight thirty four he says\nHe's their interceding for you and me Jesus Christ cities of all those right hand is they're praying for you in the day and night watching over us answering our prayers seeing to it that I Need some at\nMaybe think about this when you think about having\nThe Lord Jesus Christ who stretched out his hands and his arms and was nailed to the cross for years and my son born in his body the penalty for all of our sin and his chosen to live within us all the days of\nOur life and to walk with us answering our prayer and loving us and for giving us and cleansing us all the days of our life let me ask you a question don't you want to meet him personally there may be a lot of folks and have him but I Want to tell you there's not\nGoing to be anything like meeting him there was the third reason you went out to be thinking\nAbout heaven and that is the Bible says and John fourteen that the Lord Jesus Christ has gone home to prepare it for us he says he's going to repair place for us and if he prepares a place for us he's coming again to receive a son to himself that where he is that we may be also that is our future home is in heaven\nThat is the Lord Jesus Christ he says he was going back to prepare place frozen that if you were to pass away to date you would not go to the head when he's preparing you would go in the presence of God but the final heaven is why you're not going to spend eternity following the judgments either price\nHe said I'm going to prepare place for you and if I go and repair place for it he said in my father's house submitted mansions minute dwelling places he said that that we're not so I Would have told you I'm not going to tell you a lot so he's telling us that they're drilling places places to live\nIn heaven and he's going to prepare a place for us\nSo one of the reasons we ought to be answers and talking about it is that's where we're going to spend they turn it did with him and listen he's building your\nPlace but as opposed to raise\nThat is and it's found in the Libyans chapter three that's where our citizenship is already\nHe says inverse twenty four hour citizenship is in heaven but which also we eagerly wait for a savior the Lord Jesus Christ who will when he comes now transformed listen he will he will transform the body of our humble state\nThat is these physical bodies of hours into listen in to conformity with the body of his glory that is his glorified bodies our bodies are going to be transformed like his glorified body which will satisfy heaven that is part of the preparation is not only being said\n\nOnly being informed his likeness but ultimately the preparations going to be when I bought it is transformed into the same substance of the glorified buddy of Christ burst one them on who will transform the body of our humble state into conform with the with the body of his blurry by the exertion\nOf the power of the the the supernatural power of God that he has even to the subject all things to himself now he says one of the reasons we ought to be incident happened is that's where our citizenship is does he not talking about us being a union\nAll things to himself and he says one of the reasons we ought to be incident happened is that's where our citizenship is\nDoes he not talking about us being aliens and so journalists and pilgrims down here got never intended for us to think roots down here is if we're gonna live forever we're just passing through a lot of folks who just they think this is it\nAnd then living like this is there but this is not it and we shouldn't be living and\nLike this is why are we going to spend they turn it that we should be living as strangers Asians pilgrims sharing the wonderful gospel eternal message of grace to those about us on our way to heaven and hoping and trust thing they'll get on the caravan with us and we'll take them with is the glory\nBut there's another reason is that look a description that is not only am a citizen of another country but the Bible says something else significant I think about um this whole idea that is that our names\nAre recorded in heaven already look if you will in a loop chapter ten remember when Jesus was sending his apostles out\nAnd he told them that um he would give them power over ... and all these things and\nThey had returned and they said the day on the subject was we've seen people hills and all kinds of things take place listening about Jesus said\nHe said having told them what he was going to do for them and having heard that great testimony inverse twenty nevertheless they're not rejoicing this that the spirits is subject to you but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven\nWouldn't you agree that that's a foolish choice to make when there is another choice\nIf you wanted to ask the Lord Jesus Christ they forgive you have your sins and you're willing to repent of those things you're willing for God the turn you around change your life\nIf you're willing to tell him the day that I received Jesus Christ is my savior believing in meaning that you accept his death on the crosses payment if you're a sin and you're seeing him into your life to be here say the your life and your lord he writes your name in the lamb's book of life forever everything we've just said you have the right to look forward to it\nWhat about it\nCould you honestly and truly telling me\nThat it's wise to live a life of selfishness and independence of God\nAnd take your chances which really are no changes at all when by the grace of God\nYou can have it All right now you have internal security right

know\nNa\nNa\nWell let's let's think about that for just a moment here's what king said he said he would give that men great riches he would give him his daughter and marriage and here's the best part he would never have to pay taxes again the rest of his life [noise]\n\nAnd so it was hard for David understand why nobody would step up and take that opportunity Saul who was the Bible says head and shoulders above all of his compatriots saw would have nothing to do with this challenge\nAnd so David is mystified he has a big God nobody else seems to have one\nSo [laughter] you know the story five foot\nTall David volunteer before\nHe decided to do this something happened that reveal the human side of overcoming a site that has changed since biblical times listen to this when David\nOldest brother ... heard David asking about the reward the was\nFurious ... says he's speaking a day but why did you come to\nAbout the reward he was\nFurious first twenty eight says he's speaking today but if I did you come down here and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness sarcasm I Know your pride I Know the influence of your heart for you ever come down to see the battle\nAnd David answered his brother this way\nOne of them is they're not cause it's a brilliant answer I mean he\nDeflected Eli of anger and he brought the focus back to the matter at hand there'll be angry at me he says isn't there something more important for us to be thinking about\nWhen a man or woman listening to me he decides to be a champion for God based set themselves up for a lot of heat and criticism\nAnd David tells us that we have to stand firm in our convictions even when the closest people to us are telling us no you can't over the years that I've been leading and doing the things got his called me to do I've had so many of the people that are close to me try to talk me out of what gun talked me into\nIt and that's the truth is that something you would think they'd be on your side saying go for it no they're trying to keep you from doing it they don't have the guts to do it and they don't want you to do it either [noise]\nThen David declared that he ...\nMentioned the response can you imagine the response over on the Israeli side of the story I mean they're thinking this guy is he's a teenager he's just a boy\nTheir disbelief turned the consternation maybe even anger and like his brother's some of them just frustration\nThey felt terrible that this boy was going to go out and sacrifice himself to this humongous slow and when I saw her that he told David come over here and he tried to talking about two\nAnd then he said well if you're going to go out let me give you my armor so you're at least have some protection now if saw was head and shoulders above all the rest of the army and David five feet he didn't put on the armor he got into it [noise]\nHe walked around inside of it [noise]\nHe tried it on and he said this isn't going to work I Can't even moving this armor\nAnd so he took it off and McCain gave him\nHis blessing and let's stop for a moment to know\nWhen you study the scripture you find two people who are in contrast with each other just think about this the Bible describes Goliath by his size and his site and his shout\nBut the Bible describes David by his courage his conviction and his confidence the Bible describes Goliath by his physical attributes and the Bible describes David by his spiritual attributes very important point to remember\nWell one of the things that they had that go I didn't have was a sling\nThe Bible says David headed for the plane and on the way he stopped at a broke and gather five smooth stones and put them in his pouch and he had a slain in his hand and the approach to ...\nOne Goliath saw David he was insulted the scripture I mean it's so graphic the Bible says when he saw David he said and my dog that you come up to me with sticks\nCurse David biased God's problem using the name of day gone and then he'd go to the ball even more inverse forty four chapter Seventeen he says to David come to me and I will give you and your flesh\nAnd then he'd go to the boy even more inverse forty four chapter Seventeen he says to David come to me and I will give you and your flesh to the birds of the air and the\nBeast of the field just imagine Goliath\nHe'd been committed this valley every day for six weeks twice a day waiting for some of the show up who's willing to fight him and on this day he sees this little boy come out there know she'll do sword and the Bible says he this stained David and I looked at word off you know what it means he curled his lip at\nHim he's oh you can do it [noise]\nAnd David replied\nYou come to me with a sword and we're the sphere and with the ... but I come to you and the name of the lord of the host the God of the armies of Israel whom you have defied this day the lord will deliver you into my hand and I will strike you and take your head from you\nAnd this day I Will give the carcasses of the camp all the ... to the birds of the air and the wild piece of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel and all this assembly show know about the law does not say was sort and spare for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands that was David straight\n[laughter] [noise]\nIf it's folks but David has just infuriated the biggest bully on the block [noise]\nAnd if God isn't to David says he is David his history [noise]\nTape purposely intimidated Goliath and in doing so sets himself up\nTo win the battle notice what happens next the Bible says at that Goliath moved toward David ... says that David ran toward the giants [noise]\nIf you're watching from the hail you've seen this enormous arm to ban start walking toward and apparently unarmed a boy and then you see something really amazing you see that boy began to run toward this wire\nAnd when he was there where he wanted to be he stopped running quickly took a stone from his bag and put it in a sling and with years of experience and practice the scripture says he slung it and struck the fullest scene in his forehead so that the stone sank into his forehead and Goliath battle on his face\nTo the or eaten Hirsch who's the ballistic expert with the Israeli defense forces\nHe did a series of calculations showing that a typical ... stone hurled by an expert ... at a distance of thirty five meters would have hit their lives head with a velocity of thirty four meters per second or Seventy six miles per hour\nMore than enough to penetrate his skull and render him unconscious or dead\nDavid made good on his promise he ran he stood over Goliath took the giants sort\nCut off his head the next few moments must have been filled with a shock response of both sides the Israelites probably thought that I just see what I thought I saw [laughter]\nAnd the first things knew that they were in a world of hurt to overcome ers we fight a battle\nLike David fought and I know you know this story but you could tell I was having fun telling to you again it's one of my favorite stories in all the Bible all of us it felt like David on occasion when giants in our way\nBut because we're talking today about how we become over comers David will surely and overcome or wasn't he overcame a giant that nobody could have given him a chance to overcome\nI'd like to take just a moment now see we unwrap the story around our own lives how do we take the principles from this story from the Old Testament which we are\nGiven him a chance to overcome and I'd like to take just a moment now see we unwrap the story around our own lives how do we take the principles from this story from the Old Testament which we all know so well and apply them to our own lives what can we learn that will help us from watching David\nDo what he did by the hand of God first thing I Want to tell you the number one refused to be discouraged by your friends when you're fighting a battle when you've been called by God to do something great refused to be discouraged by your friends do you remember\nLives reaction when he hurt his younger brother ask about Goliath how many times has happened to you and to me have you ever determined to do something important only to have your closest relatives and friends doubt you\nThe sad fact is we can always count on those we look to for support in fact sometimes all we can count on them doing is mocking us are undermining us instead of encouraging and standing behind us\nI just want to tell your friends when you want to do something great for God get ready for your brothers and sisters to give you all the reasons why you should fail\nOften the criticism comes from those who don't have the courage to accept the challenge themselves\nThey're thinking seems to be if they're not going to succeed they don't want anyone else to succeed either [noise] be prepared for this challenge don't let the defensiveness resentment jealousy or anger of others deflect you from your purpose no matter how good your idea or a goal is don't expect others to immediately\nAgree with your purpose or vision you have to be determined enough to fight your own battle if they try to talk you out of it you just keep going somebody said if\nArticles from Dr germ I get the details when you contact
