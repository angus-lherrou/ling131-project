I'm a deeply religious person but whenever I make an argument I make it from the foundation of what the law says\nBecause I Want to come out and make an argument that somebody that doesn't agree with my ideology can understand that we can go back and forth and have a dialogue on it\nAnd that's the thing is you got to have that perspective we live in a democracy that is a diverse democracies democratic Republican the Republican wrote public wow that was hard a Democratic Republic\nIn which we are diverse America is a melting pot of different ideologies and choices your ideology should not rain over somebody else's choice\nIt's just that simple eight six six five five one\nNinety nine thirty three and eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three let's go to Henry on line three Henry how you doing\nI'm doing okay I got your number but now right [laughter] it all on wait I Can't believe I got him and the phone stayed on this long I'm speaking out ever since the storm or\nSorry brother and we started talking about this phone lines lit\nUp no no and I'm from that I'm I'm getting a just knocked off the line it's the towers out here on the oil rigs I Gotcha whoever's ... yeah I mean they're not even open and some of the well heads and pumping stations\nSo I'm edging the prices are going to grow up for fuel that ban do they really bite are that bad today out there in the water\n[laughter] you know not better not worse than any other time I'm so used to it it's ridiculous I Know that out here man this is like this is real life all that stuff that you're all deal with when you're landlocked\n[laughter] are you having to deal with other people I Can't even choose the people are bunk with or have to live with daily and I always I always choose the better cook [laughter]\nAnyway I got an idea\nThat we don't how about we don't have a lottery to fund the government how about a winnings\nSince they're taxable that those that goes to the government and so we make the lottery we have a lottery mhm and we have a gambling problem so we also fund\nGambling addiction a step to end it or to do away with the people that I have a problem with gambling fair and we found that we give it to a private company to hire it's hundreds of people to create and runs a lottery judge private and uh we we can have a legal stuff over there I'm sure\nHave held judgments and lighter and have a tax then therefore the revenue the government's still gets out something out of it like they don't have anything else\nYeah Baylor second Baptist out and they'll have forty seven states were running now are given to the people who buy the lottery tickets the government and all those lottery tickets that when you get taxed so you have forty seven states\nThat come here buy tickets probably the biggest louder this country's ever seen ... and all that funding goes into our tax base yeah forty seven states people are not going to be a winner maybe even get their money back from buying a ticket because all the proceeds all the way things go to the lottery ticket buyers\nI mean I'm On board here Henry ... it's a it's a very good solution that a allows for both schools of thought I never thought of it that way\nSo then then the next call as well you don't keep on having Republicans who\nCan't manage the money they're driven we buy will get us or buy new Republicans that can manage our tax base credit better way 'cause you know I remember the Republicans have\nWe buy will get us or buy new Republicans that can manage our tax base and a better way 'cause you know I remember the Republicans have not been in charge very long it's been a hundred\nYears sets construction and we got rid of the pro slavery party and give us the dogs in the streets the fire hoses on people and don't forget that now that you want them to Democrats to be in charge again move in some ways for that\nYeah I mean I I don't know why people don't know the history but we have people now come into the state that don't know nothing about the history of the Democrats and how they did people and how they still do people\nBecause uh you know they got a new a base now just while people instead of the black people and they treat them the same way you know you can't get around to it you're going to it that's just the way they are they don't know anything else that's been passed down for generations within their little family\nI don't I don't want to get off target here the the lottery is a good idea you know the same money that I could go bowling with or have any ... that I get to any other uh recreation\n... if I'm Talking to Bill Bill with totally oh man our come on Henry anyway that\nMight have been drinking too early this morning and I know it's\nToo much salt water [laughter] what a lot of money and you can do anything with your money you can gambling you ... you can go to the bowling alley and gambling there you go to the bingo and ... and gamble that there was no reason why we can't have a property and it's common\nDon't forget it's coming but don't let the government being in charge of it not ours their status in the past and you know what the lack of leadership and the inability for Republicans to be a true conservative is failing us now in that state and we have people migrating to the state since since now listen carefully\nSince the Republicans after a hundred years of reconstruction Republicans are in charge since then since we've taken charge as Republicans as conservative mistake has been nothing but go up and be better at every position you\nKnow you can look back when Medicare was not rounded probably anything was taking care of and it was all by the Democrats all they want to do is increase your taxes and taxes and taxes and you know our taxes have not been going up like they were under the Democrats mhm you got to look at the big picture guys I mean you know Democrats are not good people\nThey have failed us now those voting for them to ... on them and a sliding scale a stupid because they don't know their history they don't know I I Believe it to me they don't\nRemember yesterday must be smoking too much of that wacky weed if you ask me if you're not remember your past you're ... you're just\n... I'm giving you a warning this time I'm giving you a warning this time he got about ... seconds sixty thirty seconds they\nTalk about it oh well I mean let me get the Senate thirty seconds I heard you on the radio yesterday talking about Christ writing Lance names in the sand you know think about this he was writing it's one of those centers of those men and each\nTime he wrote their name itself where were you last night with Billy or so and so each one about ... dropped the rock and left until there was nothing there to accuse her memory and that was the man what was the man that she committed adultery with yup\nSo here's the thing now this is what you gotta ask yourself we can we\nCan disagree on whether the lotteries a moral all that stuff blah blah blah but you gotta think about this now people who's\nIn your life that if you want a lottery might be sneaking up behind you with a knife you might want to get rid of those people eight\nSix six five five one Ninety nine

more of a liberal belief especially if it's from an ethical standpoint you have you are being more of a liberal than a Republican is not a Republican belief to say that the government should dictate

one too\nOh my gosh you're hearing about all the personality and now a Chevy Chase and I'm Still married did not like each other and this is fascinating to watch that and how that came about\nNo you're right you're not the right to let\nThe cartilage a Caddyshack happen organically in a lot of the the script and and what they feel very interesting\nYep you're right ... and it was really funny when you watch stuff like that is that if you go back and watch the movie you look at it through an entirely different set of eyes\nYeah the the whole scene where bill Murray's a take his life but the flowers\nThat's all made up row yeah oh yeah absolutely part that's my favorite part you are correct it anyways I Love your show Michael thanks for entertaining me in the morning\nWell our research going in there but I wrote my\nAnimal that's good to Alan's call hello Ellen how are you\nA reasonable well I I don't know not fall allergies are worse than not playing allergies\nOh don't even get me started I'm right there in that little tiny sliver of time we're in between the two so I feel your pain\nYeah listen guys don't give the Democrats any\nItaly why don't do that ...\nThere were five people in Indiana that porch names to get bronco bombers name up all the primaries last in Indiana the first time if they hadn't done that he wouldn't be your own would not have been on the Democratic party\nPrimary in Indiana and he'd never won depression is a ... not had enough votes to win the primary thing don't give the Democrats ...\n... all one holders says something about when they're down we kick him\nYeah and it's a point where people who are Democrats are down ...\nDon't let any body for yet have this seat so corrupt\nJust just just the people were evil their self centered in April and don't let up on them for a moment because they will find some but yeah I haven't gotten over legitimate election for two years ago they will find something just stay on election if they can\nDon't let up on the plate Josh\n... very much and let's get the Clark's call hey mark how are you\nI'm doing well Mike on yourself good good deal\nSo on the Democrats being down you know you could make the analogy of the current miles on Tigris or you could go back in the shoe tied even but uh I mean you know I'm not an Alabama fan but I kind of felt bad for the Todd when they were were they were back in the day\nA lot of Alabama fan but I kind of felt bad for the Todd when they were were they were back in the day and I didn't want to see him completely destroyed recall him\nAnd you know I normally don't give a lot of consideration the things that Hillary says\nWhat you stop and think about it why should\nWe be civil to somebody that wants to destroy everything we believe in\n\nI mean those are words directly from her mouth right yeah oh ... and worse\nWell you know is there any doubt in your mind that the left wants to destroy everything that we believe him\nThere's no doubt in my mind that the left will do anything to regain or maintain power regardless of what that looks like\nYes and destroy our constitution and our country and the process\nAnd they have said as much\nYep so\nI you know you flip first statement around and uh yeah they're messed up and you know especially when you consider the fact that they control the media I mean you know they've got everything in their favor and they still can't sell their ideas and the reason for that is their ideas are so bad\nThey truly are\nThey truly are and you know what else is interesting Clark is that typically you know and any problem in life might have a solution or to or maybe three maybe four but some of them only have one\nAnd if you have a problem and you have one great solution and you're on the opposing side you've got to take the solution is not really a solution at all and that's what the Democrats are trying to do here and what they don't seem to understand is that people are smart enough\nTo protect me and this hyper age of the Internet where they see through a lot of this kind of crap and the reality of it is is that you know being in opposition to what conservatives believe or Donald Trump tries to do a rubber Republicans warm that's not a political position\nAnd that's just an antithetical position for the purposes of posturing and enough Americans are starting to see it for exactly what it is\nWell I'm going to take what you're saying just a step further you know my whole life I've heard crazy\nAs an outhouse rap and I never had really given not a whole lot of thought but right now the\nDemocrats are crazy is out house rats and I think it's because they're completely trapped yeah and they everything going away\nYou know they've never been in the kind of danger that they're in right now if the Republicans hold both both houses and we get real an honest investigations\nI think the Democrat Party as we've noted is going to be dealt to blow that it'll take it what decades to recover\nI don't I don't disagree but you know what I'd like to also say ... and Jason ... as you know knocked out on this yesterday or the day before\nIn addition to retain in the house and Senate I Would love to have\nAn attorney general but I could really depend on his way out to be as a you know as as aggressive as we'd all like to see him but no your observation is very astute in that regard\nBecause the simple fact of the matter is is if we were you know if we maintain the the upper and lower and of course you know the White House has not even you know often play at this point in time\nAnd we have somebody that's going to go after these ah these fools that just consistently are trying to you surf the constitution and create their own laws along the way as well as now the um the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\nThe Democrats I mean you know ... ...\nYou shouldn't and created their own laws along the way as well as now the um the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh the Democrats I mean you know ... Miller who pass from years ago wrote a book on a national party no more and you know this was you know Twenty years ago but I mean they legitimately will be a party left him a dust\nYeah and I you know you talk about getting a new attorney general John it got to wonder\nIf Donald Trump is not just playing the game with them right now and letting them twist for the time being and he doesn't have plans to make a move all the more I watch him more fascinated object um\nWith just how or down the board looking\nWell you know there's been so many of you know accusations that he ... he has ruined our political background but when people seem to understand is that the politics of international\nOur office and it certainly is something worth considering there are a real problem we have is that and it's such a part of that the size of the signal is the fact that the super station what a one signal is so vast\nIt would take it would take you know millions of lives and thousands of dollars\nBut uh anyway no it's it's a it's a good recommendation early and we also you know we always invite candidates in the local races to contact us directly and let us know whatever's on their mind and then two of the uh the midterms that invitation is officially extended\nEight six six five five one nine nine three three is the number for a a James hanging out in Studio doing answering the calls are run on the board just kind of hanging out with you guys today\nTalking about some of the silly news of the day of course the big news story is Elizabeth Warren and her idiotic or see but there's other idiosyncrasies out there for us to cover as well so you don't get a scholarship whatever's on your mind and ah what is kind of take it from there and let's get back to the phones and we'll talk to Joe and Hello John how are you\nIn a way [noise] [noise] [noise] right now I'm really enjoying it I think\nWell thank you during this race where if you decide you to\nSometimes you just gotta laugh at it because it has gotten that silly and\nSo that's why I have a garage full of camping gear because I Need to get out and just commune with nature turn off my devices and forget that some of this nonsense even exists\nLike Dr psycho said sometimes you got to unplug mhm and run away\nBecause it is it it's fruity it just is and you know the ... the I Can't even keep up with the means and some of them are so priceless yeah mhm\nYeah and to watch these Democrats just it's they're like a bunch of maggots all crawling all over each other trying to get to that piece of dead meat and it's just it's just you're watching me just go oh my gosh what are they thinking why they thinking and then again you know you get to the dealings\nThat they're constantly interviewing on the side of the road asking them who the president is and you know both drawn generally isn't it yeah and then [laughter] I Know I saw that last week and\nYou know you just have to kind of sorry for them but you know I said it was last week maybe these idiots map there really maybe they're all under something maybe the whole ignorance is bliss thing maybe there's some\nValue in that because you know you turn on the news and you just you look at this stuff and you know you and I realize you and I communicate all day long and sometimes into the evening about what we're going to the following day\nAnd you get on your phone your devise your computer or whatever and you look at the news the trendy news of the day and you just like a no ... nobody's getting now you were talking about going to you know the end of these ah ah these heavy handed conspiracy theories that make no sense whatsoever you know the flower stuff for example\nThat seems insane\nThen you look at well little Lizzie and you just think it can't get any worse\nAnd then it does\nYeah but Michael you just watch the ... and ... say if you will of Animal House and was one of the best clothes on their son you can go through life\nYeah fat drunken stupid well apparently you can and apparently a few people have and it's worked out for him quite\nWell but you know if we don't have the people with the common sense in the fourth ... to see things\nAnd apparently a few people have and it's worked out for them quite\nWell but\nYou know if we don't have the people with the common sense and the fourth ought to see things through into fixings are broken\nWell it's just like in an interview that was done a couple of days ago and I don't want to elaborate on this\nToo much but Alexander\nCortez was trying to make the argument the low unemployment is bad for the country\nUh oh yeah [laughter] and then the problem is the problem is [noise]\nI don't have enough cough let me let me let me let me give an example I went to um to very high school I'm John Carroll for a couple of years and then eventually I transferred over to bury because I was you know my friends I went to bury and I want to be closer to them and you know my parents were just talking about driving me from her role right downtown Birmingham which is er John Carroll was located at that time\nAnd I was having some problems in math\nAnd I still have problems with ... computer with me everywhere I go but anyway I was having some problems in math and what am I what am I teachers his name was I'm Thomas ... from ah from Barry and I went to ... and I went to I ... and I asked him you know to help me out a little bit this guy when it came to math\nWas brilliant I mean he just was brilliant but I was so far removed from the formulas and the\nUnderstanding that he sometimes got frustrated with me because he couldn't understand what I couldn't grasp that makes any sense\nIt's almost like he couldn't dumb himself down enough to my level do bring me up to a point where what he was going to share with me it would make sense I'm that way with Democrats I Can't get that stupid\nSo you can go down to the level one exports to X equals purple\nI Can't go down to the level of I'm One one thousand and twenty four Indian so\nIt it was my address I mean I Can't I Can't go and why in the world doesn't even matter and on top of that is that not a perfect example of cultural appropriation if you will and pandering to a certain minority group\nYeah bye Here's the thing she can make so much money now with the whole climate change thing all we need now is Elizabeth Warren on the side of the road looking at traffic and somewhat throw a bag of trash at her feet and then she just there is that the camera with a single tear\nYou ever seen the movie Joe Dirt Jody or take yeah\nJodie air today and there's little from the Indian guy selling bottle rockets on the side of the road that's where I Lived with Warren needs to be bought [laughter]\nBottle rockets in sparking wars\n... showed up a frog no it never entered [laughter]\n[noise] ah the bad thing now yeah how's\nElizabeth Warren need to get herself a cheap cowboy hat a VW bus and open ... stand on the side of some remote dusty interstate somewhere and leave the rest of the adults alone\nThat's the smartest thing I've ever heard anyone say about any thing\n[laughter] [noise] uh\nUh was\nIt was that most of the great bread go knock on more than ... ... ... ... Warren you ever been assigned a real t._v.\nMm oh gosh I was about to get bad trouble over at back\nSaving distribution Michael has his doodles\nIs a good day on superficial one oh one WIP [noise]\nHome places keeping homebuyers happy says Nineteen sixty nine with quality sales and service\nThe whole place is a gaping hole buyers happiness at Nineteen sixty nine with quality sales and service out of time to look for your dream home during the home plate sister's late model so\nYou'll find great prices the whole place has a great selection of deer valley home valley the heaviest all built buying a house or the single most important investment you'll ever me to be your dream of homeownership or reality\nThe whole place is committed to helping you in every way\nWhether you're a young couple just starting out or need several bedrooms for the kids for planned it just right down the political your dream home during the hunt places this play bottle so the whole place conveniently located exit two eighty on like sixty five year\nAnd a pencil belly parkway and that's the only place since Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nEvery business needs good partners to help them succeed and meet their goal vertical solutions media has been working with small to mid sized companies in the Birmingham area for over ten years in fact even the trusted marketing partner but it's very radio station for almost three years\nVertical solutions media has experience working with a wide range of industries and with companies of all sizes are small retail stores to multi stay corporations their approaches customize to the needs of each client whether offering occasional projects support or fully integrated day to day marketing operations in addition vertical solutions\nMedia recently lost a new Web development division called outlined start they specialize in online Web strategies and build affinity with your audience for friends are wearing his and the prospects for yourself process was a free no obligations sixty minute marketing consultation call them at two o five nine\nThree six three one seven for er visits our website at vertical solutions media dot com\nThe following it does not necessarily reflect the opinions or views have proper broadcasting its employees affiliates or advertisers mom room\nThat's what's on the line and this year's election this is just as Tom Parker you also how the leftist mob stride to tear down just as Kevin off\nThey want me to be next to have served for Thirteen Years on the Alabama Supreme Court has a strong independent conservative voice has taken on and beating the Southern Poverty Law Center and been outspoken that roe v Wade and murder found were wrongly decided\nAnd I'm a strong supporter of President Trump and his efforts to put more conservatives on our federal courts to left his mom doesn't like that\nThey want judges who will overturn our laws and look the other way when the leftist mob tries to destroy Russian side to this is justice Tom Parker", "show_name": "The Guys", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "16"}
