got to think about it is and it kind of contradictory if they can only have one female parts and all these big old board of directors or whatever when there's not just to stretch that any more yeah it's like well for a while now\nUh apparently I I think on the spectrum I think we're around a thousand now so I think every board is going to need a thousand people just so we can have equal representation\nUh apparently I I think on the spectrum I think we're around a thousand now so I think every board is going to need a thousand people just so we can have equal representation\nExactly to get out of control it wrote a another thing is to oh\nI'm twenty six years old I'm a young guy I'm a follow up lift my country and ah you know I I I'm a patriot I Love the scotch all of our history thanks for your service that I Am so tired of\nThe white Christian male being the bad guy and everything you know I think we should do I think we should just all ... or so I'm just all move there and take back all of our vision electorate is a fellow fall back on TALK about everything that a Christian white men and just take it back\nI mean that's one theory there Eric ah [laughter] I don't even know how to respond to that um\nIt really is weird to see the fact that white Christian males are being demonized because it's like I don't think like I could find a group that is like more cordial\nLike ... like I get it there are some ... there are some um what's the word I'm looking for there is some radicals in a barren but there are radicals for every religious sect\nUm but to like demonize I mean I said something on Twitter the other day and a girl said oh you wouldn't really know about that because you're a white male and I was like what does not have to do with anything exactly\nWhat the legs seriously association\nAnd that's what I was saying she assumed to my race and my gender maybe on one one thousand twenty fourth Native American like Elizabeth Warren back on the lady [laughter]\nLaugh but it just tries I just I get so sick of that 'cause I'm twenty six years old and I have wash my clothes on a ... ... I'm not privileged ... dirt poor\nYeah I Want to do that a lot I mean like that I I'm not some rich privileged person I work my ass off where everything I've got\nBut see he therein lies the problem is now a days the color of your skin is posted the note economic privilege\nAnd let me tell you it does not especially from the way that a lot of us are a lot of us grew up right I'm typically called white even though that I'm a genetic mixture but I guess if we're just going to be surface level and look at the skin color\nYou know kind of a racist policy but we'll go with what the Democrats do or if we're just looking at the color somebody's getting there are a lot of us that started out a little low like a very very low income my parents were the first\nIn their families to go to college and make it\nEssentially above like lower middle class I mean and they're teaching me those same values the same way that they grew up I mean it's just absolutely absolutely\nUm edit abhorrent to say that just because you're white means you're better off in this country it's stupid it hasn't been that way it's been outlawed since Nineteen sixty four and it's just an ignorant ignorant premise\n[noise] well I Want to say there's a lot to say I'm going to let you go ah ah my family came over here in the early Nineteen hundreds illegal Irish immigrants yeah ah well I'm Irish look how bad we got treated like the entire time I was in the u._s. yeah all my compensation too so you have a good ... you don't get a [laughter]\n... God Bless you that is something that we don't hear you don't hear a lot of Irish people asking for reparations\nSo if we if we can throw Irish people out of uh what's the phraseology the use of Irish people are no longer in the um oh what's the word that's used Dylan um he just used it I'm blanking\nOh my gosh I've never had a brain part this hard on air or it's where\nIt's used Dylan um he just used it I'm blanking\nOh my gosh I've never had a brain part this hard on air or it's where\nOh my God well I'm going to transition 'cause I Can't remember it's where somebody said oh privilege privilege if Irish can never be included and white privilege any more than what are we talking about because then that kind of denotes Europe that that's not European privilege anymore because Ireland is technically a part of Europe so ... to\n... hours is like the second most white country out there yeah yeah yeah but they were he's right the Irish are\nTreated poorly um when they first emigrated over here so we can no longer say that it's just white privilege across the board we have to specify further and really nailed down this mythical patriarchy doing\nWhat what is it I'm thinking I'm thinking it's whoever the Democrats look at and just based off of the color of your skin make it not Democrats I'm Sorry leftist look at you and make a judgment just based off of the color of your skin knowing nothing about you\nAnd not knowing you as an individual but just identify you collectively\n'cause you know that's not a racist policy or anything hey you probably do this because of the color of your skin [laughter] I mean it's just laughable and Republicans are the\nRacist got it got it really makes sense if you don't think about it but we've gone down multiple rabbit holes let's get back to this article do you remember what we're talking about K ivy yeah we're still talking about ... ah we're still talking about K granting gay\nGrainy K I feel like you know others Toys R us babies are us I feel like there should be a store for grandparents and it should be ... like Special K ...\nI I mean I'm I'm full of ideas here if anybody wants to make a million dollars hit me up and we'll make it together eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three so again we're we're talking about on yellow hammer news dot com Kay Ivey reaffirms her support for pro life amendment opposed by Walt Maddox\nSo her democratic opponent Tuscaloosa mayor Walt Maddox opposes the pro life amendment as this Planned Parenthood ill the feminist majority oxymoron and the ACLU and other out of state liberal groups\nQuote it is unconscionable to me that Walt Maddox will join abortion rights activists from across the country and opposing this measure that simply recognizes the rights\nOf precious unborn babies ivy emphasize the governor also rallied voters to support the amendment on election day that's something I Want to say to this is something that needs to be in the Alabama constitution voted in\nAbortion was federalized essentially by Robie wave a power that the judiciary was never supposed\nTo have to create federal law\nThat's the rule of the legislature but nevertheless nevertheless they essentially created federal law and became the legislative armed through the judicial branch don't allow that to happen make Alabama different and ratify this come election day vote yes\nThat costs to go out all these horrible why people should have put it this quiet about being white and the United states\nWell I think it's worth going from a longevity a standpoint than I Would definitely be the hundred year old black man\nYou have you\nUh if you're telling me I'm going to diet fifty versus dying in a hundred I'm not looking at the color must chemical or my skin's and consequential I'm thinking what am I live in the market and going out\nYou are the first white person that that would have like a\nLot of people aren't thinking of when they're going to die or not\nIf you had a choice\nTo live to be a hundred years of the black person mhm or hundreds or did is being a white person which one would you choose\nI Would choose one hundred years as a black person because I'd rather live one hundred and fifty one hundred greater than fifty\nLight all my book now and then goes all the current of white people that did this corner that by being in the United states oh come on late night how would you like to be a black person in the United states\n... helped me nailed down here what white and black or because I don't think there's any one hundred percent there's very few except for Elizabeth Warren nearly one hundred percent white people\nAnd there's very few one hundred percent black people every body is a mix of colors and creeds and culture [laughter] you liked it a little bit more in reference to know that was pretty good I I was pretty good\nI Know oh this is Liz Liz Liz ... as long as I've been living\nDo you like a little bit more in reference to that now that was pretty good I I was pretty good\nI Know oh this is Liz Liz Liz ... as long as I've been living in a blast walls got an old saying you know I just signed a black person with good hair they always say the guy it'd be and then they blew mhm so you\nKnow so you know so it would be able to see a black person was real good hair ... starts to let's say if the guy in the end of it yeah so that list of what\nYou don't live with Warren doesn't have a good ... she got no hair no commonsense I just don't understand how you see guys on by black people huh how big expensive like people say that\nI thought Elizabeth Warren thought she was black as well [noise] I Will not well I'll tell you list I don't know that was racial Dolan ... sorry one of the St Louis\nThere was a black and white people ... ... you know like people with black people in the United states got all type of different colors you know I'm going to become an ...\nType difficult light skinned dark skin like me I'm you know I'm Talking about you know how difficult it's just like why people you know got different color hair blowing\nCommitted\nBut see I think there's all different shades of white people do yeah I mean I'm considered white but I'm pretty than\n[noise] but you know 'cause I actually I didn't hear it differently on the black and white keep\n'em in like you know it's been going on\nSince we have here yeah you know I'm I'm I'm like I don't understand ...\n... so the question is what constitutes black and white because what if there's somebody like me who has black ancestors but as predominantly white then what\n[laughter]\nLuckiest you won the lottery I [laughter] I I'm I'm up to my ... I'm\nA little air but no we got a racial problem here in the United states you know and and the thing is that you know we all got to come together and fix it black people got the state's black people got six black people plop you know and I'm Talking about like you know and I'm white people should have no problems at all I got to do this right now\nLet's see I don't think there are black people and white people problems I think there are American problems I mean when people say why people problems they point to the clue Klux Klan and that's the ... it's just as an ignorant of an argument and saying that a radical Islamic terrorism is system as a a what all of Islam is it's just not true\nSo I mean I just don't see why that comparisons made the difference between radicalization and normal everyday people\n[noise] [noise] well I'm I'm Talking about you know it's here you know is is is here I'm kind of like I don't have the answer for it\nI'm I'm Talking about\nA lot of these great leaders have the absolute fool it I just think [noise] um [noise] I don't know I'm Talking about hey I'm I'm I'm\nI'm stumped on that one see yeah but the first time I was stumped carry their early do it's a good morning man\n[laughter] I'll start but but you know but I just don't see I'm the one I just don't make sense to me yeah or\nA white man in the United states the ... and when you can do when you say\nOkay you don't do anything\nBut here's the thing everybody in the United states has the same equality of opportunity now let me finish the statement there is as such a thing as economic privilege right there are some people that are born into a higher income household that doesn't necessitate a certain racial\nConnotation right you can be black and born into a very wealthy households or you can be white and born into a very wealthy\nThat doesn't necessitate a certain racial connotation right you can be black and born into a very wealthy households or you can be white and born into a very wealthy household but I don't think simply your race put you better off in this country now in our modern times\nBlah blah blah [laughter] almost cooked lives to be I Would have had dropped we knew that list look look when you walk out the door ...\nAnd you know and people see that black skin you know they're gonna get intimidated a little bit or they go to the question though they're going to take up to like you know ... do they learn just like the white laid a solid black man I went through that part of the ...\nI did see that yeah you see that\nBut she she like I can look at her as somebody who's typically called a white man and it was probably mostly white I can look at her and say she's a moron or there's other words for it but I Can't give them money or she's a moron she's not she's not closer like not white people as a whole\nYou know I respect her for like you know question because I think you know I you know like we ... we do a lot of car\nYou know and you know of them you know hey you know a whole lot you know but I'm thinking you know but she said that just say hey listen you know she had a partnership just cop always she should've followed them too is you know you know to his door\nI turn around and that was stupid yeah you know what I'm saying and I'm like in like a\nStupid people didn't even think that's what I'm saying she's an idiot\nWell I'll do that like you know what like sometime I go through for you know late in the little black kid have wrote a book in in uh in New York\n[laughter] taught but anybody can look at that woman like if we're just going to be honest but if we're just going to be real honesty you could look at her and say yeah that's not true like you could just like he just looks like one of them crazy when he's\nUp to ... a ... does she have a bit up till\nThey're like no I'm not going there Gary you're going to give me in trouble now\n[laughter] [noise] oh but you know this but Liz that's the question\nThat people say to shift today would you rather live to be a hundred years as a black person or ... years was a white person if you had a choice\nAh I'd lead one hundred years with a black person longevity so simple

galactic anomalies so y'all be patient will get through it together so we do have this started to talk about we do have Hillary Clinton it was a war and in the news look we're looking for stuff to talk about\n'cause it's the same thing well what's still do last night we had a brush her to say about it have any recommendations for how to get a match out of a doodle let's go down that route\nWell you've got to brush or because they are a or a longer haired on ... you really should brother and his curly so you really should brush or at least once a day\nOr thank you for that OK maybe go to the next topic has the easiest way to get rid of them yeah\nI Know other than cut them out [noise] yeah I don't\nThat's why a short haired I don't want to talk about headline news\nBut yeah three big name hers hadn't really used and CNN sister network mhm three people that I have no idea who they are but it just goes to show you that CNN like the Democrat Party is in trouble and it's very\nInteresting that we are now as of yesterday Twenty one days removed from what might be the biggest mid term in at least the last two generations if not three\nAnd I don't want to go on one of my luxury rants ladies and gentlemen this is a time for us to have a very very serious conversation\nAbout getting people bought out to the pole and showing up to vote because I'm telling ya if we lose the house the Senate on not that concerned about\nBut if we lose the house of representatives we have got a real mess on our hands and if\nYou think that the rocky relationship between Democrats and Donald Trump is something now just wait until event because you've got to remember that who else flipped their party and the first midterm wow that would have been all Brock\nAnd the challenges that that caused in this country now we have two more professors that have come out yesterday that are supporting the notion\nOf eight court packing plan to remove Brett Kavanaugh or to at least sway the court so if they if the Democrats happened when the house\nThe impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump will proceed the impeachment proceedings against Brett Kavanaugh and I'll tell you something and this is absolutely the truth I don't care where you come down politically\nIf we get into a dish him where we are in\nJust in peach meant happy\nPut the national security of this country at risk\nBecause other countries love when America now I'm Talking about the dictatorial countries they love when America is destabilize remember going at each other's throats\nAnd if we don't secure especially the house of representatives three weeks from yesterday you were going to not recognize this country and the next couple of years\nPeople in and talk radio where they spy particular emphasis on conservative talk are often are accused of outlandish claims that the Democrats aren't but you know are fanning the flames and a rhetorical commentary et cetera this is ...\nUm outlandish claims about what the Democrats aren't but\nYou know are fanning the flames and a rhetorical commentary et cetera this is not one of those times\nThis is one of those times when I'm being very very very serious about this because the midterms\nHistorically speaking in this country have been complete snooze fast and people don't care what people have better wake up and start to care this time around because you're going to see what ever it is a Donald Trump that's that has pleased the those are you that he has plays all that gets caught into jeopardy\nOr lines rope and eight six six five five one nine nine three three and let's start with Derek hey Derek how are you\nUm hey that Democrats have already put our national security at risk starting with Hillary Clinton and her private email server\nUm I I mean we could sit down and talk about what the Democrats than the national security all day long uh [laughter] I think I said before it's time to call in the Marines\nIn what respect\nOr [noise] I I Believe that there is trees and his forces inside the FBI are that are still\nThere department of justice and say and they needed to read it out\nWell when you say bring the Marines in or are you referring to martial law or something similar\n[noise] something similar I unfortunately I don't like I don't like saying that that if a if that's the only way to do it to clean house like it needs to happen um I Believe ... has been committed by some of the highest levels of our officials howdy combat that\n\nWell also flipping the house\nCause a lot of those investigations into question as well\nAnd there's a lot of floated I don't think there's fifty thousand indictments sitting on a table waiting to be delivered but I Do know is it as a handful of them there and if we if we didn't lose the house of representatives\nOh well that's good Stein meat as well and I just don't think enough people realize what is truly at stake here because so many people are so politically disengaged\nBut when I say that it's going to a cause national security issues that's not to discount what Hillary's done up to this point but the reality of the fact is that what Americans which has happened in our past before we see a lot of um\nWell let's just say cloak and dagger activity directed towards the United states ran the United states is busy consuming itself from the inside or as Abraham Lincoln was fond of saying a house divided against itself\nCannot stand that's exactly right and ...\nWell I mean we all need to wise up and realize that's why I'm I'm your pledges to combat foreign enemies and domestic\nYeah you got it I I ... I Believe we'd better ... within\nNo I agree with that I completely do there are good call thanks for making a\nLot\nI think of something like that were to be instituted the it would backfire big Tom and not that I don't agree that something like this are like that might or should happen but you got to look at\nWind troops were deployed inside the United states in the past looking Katrina mhm migratory and uh happened the city was devastated instructor was gone police couldn't do their jobs coast guard couldn't do their jobs because they were getting shot at\nSo Fort Bragg was mobile laws in Haiti second listen down I think it was versus the FAA before but anyways you ...\nGarden do their jobs because they were getting shot at so Fort Bragg was ... it was done everything goes versus the FAA before but anyway you have paratroopers walking down Bourbon Street St Charles avenue\nAudubon body armor on combat load emission\nGoing through the streets as a security force they they were getting pop shops they can add up now they weren't allowed to shoot back unless they could verify who was shoot or by the same rate\nYou see that now they're so Katrina people haven't had an idea why they were there but you just start flooding the streets with guys and girls just because of what's going on and start removing elected officials out of their offices in our homes for trials and\nBut you know and some of the major cities that are more towards Portland for example\nIt's starting to feel\nI can tell you there were a couple of James that if I could have recommended death if I was given that choice they got death I'm not going to say what branch in where it but ah\nI sat on some that just Pearl by here but anyway\nGetting back to a these units are at Katrina James let me ask you this what is the civilian equivalent of obeying an illegal order\n\nThe civilian equivalent of a banner\nYou out of order yeah accessory to cry\nRight you're an accessory to a crime because an illegal order is a following an illegal order makes you justice guilty ad or culpable as the officer issuing that illegal order\nAnd I think ... years of hindsight there is no debate that those dirt bags from the thirteenth military police brigade were obeying illegal orders and I'll tell you what\nThat currently that was in charge of that uh that a composite brigade God I Wish I would've been a sitting on the panel for his court martial oh my God I Wish I was I just sat there back to death I promise you\nYeah but you know they're going to get it this way when when you bring something up like that\nYou also going to take into account the rink structure of the people in charge so I wouldn't hold a profit you want or property or he has the or in your case of Lance corporal or anybody like that I found a break because they're doing what they're told and that's what they've been taught to do and that's what they're supposed to do what you point\nIs when you got a deployment like that James okay how many echelons do you have between the brigade commander\nAnd the platoon commander\nFive five echelons of obeying where in the mission of the United States Army\nDoesn't give them the right to violate the civil rights of American citizen I Know what you're going to say if martial law's declared and ... but there was no martial law declared in Katrina and the weapons confiscation was not what it was not solely with in the city limits of New Orleans\nThey wind up onto the north shore they were in Hammond they went all the way up to the Mississippi border\nWell I understand that but if you remember when my comments and I said when I said they would not be a good idea and I use Katrina as an example showing how would I Would not be a good idea\nCertainly what the point is that there should have been at least five genes at least five general court general court marshals for officers that were in there because their duty\nTo the constitution of the United states was just say I can not fulfill this illegal editor but they got the guys that they had in the ... uh who wants to ... um that ran for president after the Clintons he was the uh\nUm he was the chairman of the joint chiefs of what was his name Wesley Clark I'm here to tell you right now Wesley Clark should have gone up just for a general court martial for having started for having anything to do with that it was cut and dry now before I should've said this is the beginning of the phone call\nShould have gone up ... for a general court martial for having started for having anything to do with it it was cutting ... now before I should've said this at the beginning of the phone call in Nineteen Twenty one\nUnited States Marine Corps was deployed to guard mail runs because you've got a lot of veterans from World war one that were um\nThey were complaining about not getting their uh veterans' benefits something like that and then what was happening is those\nWell alleged veterans were attacking the mail delivery throughout the east and out into Ohio so United States Marines companies were deployed to guard mail\nBut there's a big difference between guarding runs in confiscating weapons no United States military unit should ever be involved in something is dirty is that\n... and I just as someone who had experience with general court martial\nAnd knowing what the criteria for bringing an officer up for a general court martial or for that matter a senior enlisted bad\nUh everybody involved in that ... painting sounds me\nAny second Airborne Division should have been prosecuted in jail for that\nBut what can you expect from ... from the ... bag dirt ball that unit ought to be disbanded for that quite as if they committed in Afghanistan and I witnessed some of 'em James he felt the command structure in that division\nTim I appreciate the call and I'm sure they do as well\nYeah I'd like in eighty second trooper to call in you want to talk about ended up personal information\nI'll meet that guy at the corner I see that makes it all American patch I still get rabid wanna fight\nI Can't stand they get by on play fetch you know from the from the beginning and you know it's funny you can get another unit in the United States Army that were the most ... some of the most professional guys I ever ... operated with Afghanistan and Iraq professional to the nights the hundred and first\nYou got the second which is a drag from the military and the hundred and first that I'd be happy you allowed to operate in the United States Marine\nThank you Jim runny difference where she had to call Jim\n\nHow little axe to grind and I guess\nYeah and speaking about access to grind Donald Trump has called Stormy Daniels horse face\n[noise] ...\nMaybe she was born with and maybe it's\nUm on Tuesday yeah he got her a horse race and threatened to go after her\nWhen they won a chord victory over his alleged mistress and then there was one woman\nThat ah oh I was on CNN made a comment about why a ... is not concerned about Donald's mistresses because perhaps she was one that's how seedy the conversation from the left\nHas gotten a federal judge just thrown out Stormy Daniels lawsuit ... versus Trump and Trump is entitled to all legal fees you went on to say now and go after horse face and her third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me hey total con\nWhat's funny the discourse is lovely oh it is and if anyone ever watch the scene in it and if anyone who wants to do is watch the scene and I I Would not want them anymore because when the Stormy Daniels thing was going to hand her\nNever watches CNN it and if anyone who wasn't so is watch the scene and I I Would not watch them anymore because when the Stormy Daniels thing was going to have her on an interview\nShe was discussing and describing certain attributes alone wrong and they were applauding giggling at it laughing right thing to such a great thing he says horse face yeah and they lose oh yeah yeah so uh\nBut then again Michael I have an audio response by calling ... disgusting massaging is\nYeah yeah because somebody who has a minister's really hates women\nBut you know isn't it interesting to watch the uh the school yard banter\nAnd never well at least not since Obama was president but prior to that almost never happened\nSo publicly that's not a suggestion previous presidents haven't had a few a choice words and phrases for the media and their detractors but nothing like what we're witnessing in this country today there was a real quick break come back let Assad Josh ... first on the other side you're listening to the ...\nWhen the universe the room ... even stands up it's the mud hut show\nThere see here have this class of water oh you don't drink tap water too much of a chemical taste for you when you cook with it you bathe in it but you don't drink it because of that growth marine taste em I write that bad taste it's caused by a lot more than just scoring\nWhen people jumped prescription drugs down the toilet when pesticides in a hormone seep into groundwater all of these work to make that bad taste you hate so much that you can keep your waters said in chemical free with the Hague water purification system takes systems aren't coming to my self cleaning whole house multi stage
