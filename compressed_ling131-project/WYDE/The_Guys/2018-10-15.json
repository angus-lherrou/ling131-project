thirty so you don't want to stick around for that we're going to get into the politics of the day ask him about what happened with cab and all I Do want to talk to them a little bit about this mob mentality thing that we talked about\nIn the first ten to Fifteen minutes because I think that it's a very very important topic and we can also talked about this too because I think this is a very important topic because\nYou know I think a lot of the times we ask our leaders the wrong question\nYou know we ask our leaders what do you think about this thing that's here today and gone tomorrow and when you know how they view something that's here today and gone tomorrow you don't really you know how they feel about one issue but if you ask them how they feel about the things that\nYou spend a lifetime thinking about you really know where their heads up so I think it'll be interesting to talk to him about some of these topics really excited to have him on the program so again we're talking about this idea of how does your past affects\nThat so I think it'll be interesting to talk to him about some of these topics really excited to have him on the program so again we're talking about this idea of how does your past affect you and are reading the story from John eight where a woman who has committed adultery\nIs being brought before Jesus and they're trying the fairest seeds of the day the ones with the holier than thou attitudes really that's how I like to\nParaphrase them are coming forward and they're saying\nThe last ... and say we should condemn this woman what do you say right and we'll pick up where we left off we were talking about Jesus melt down in the sand and started writing and\nAgain just really quick we are the woman in that scenario right\nWhere the person that could not stand up to that they could not stand up to the laws of Moses and part of the laws of Moses what we violate we deserve a repercussion for if there is no Christ\nIf there is no savior and we violate the laws of Moses than we deserve a punishment that is in that type of realm right we we deserve that punishment that the law lays out in the law lays out punishments for when you violate the law of Moses\nSo they bring forward this woman and Jesus kneels down in the sand and he starts writing\nAnd this is the idea that just absolutely overcame me is when my pastor said why do you think Jesus is kneeling down\nAnd writing in the sand when they bring such a serious charge to him and basically the question is not what should we do to this woman the question is how do we view how do you view the laws of Moses and they're trying to trip him up to bring a heretical charge against\nThem right and he bends down and he starts arriving in the sand\nAnd at that point is everyone still looking at the woman hollering and still to at the woman ready to throw stones at her or are they looking at the religious leader that they just ask what they're supposed to do the guy that claims to be the son of God in what is he doing he's writing in the sand instead of answering\nThat question and then after that he stands up\nAnd he says one of my favorite versus in the entire Bible again this is John eight if you want to read it for yourself he says he who was that he who is without sin among you let him be the first to throw a stone at her and again he stoop down\nAnd wrote on the ground again\nLet that sink and they're saying what should we do to this woman oh holier than now we have brought you this woman that send that's violating the law of Moses and we never violate the law of Moses just this woman and he said OK anyone of you who has not send who has not violated the law of Moses\nGo for it pick up that stone in her letter and then he stoop down and continues to write\nSo not only does he push it back at them then he kneeled down to take that image offer like to take all eyes off of her again\nRight and it said and when they heard this they began to go out one by one beginning with the older ones and he was left alone in the woman where she had been in the midst\nSo they left because he said any of you that happens then go ahead stoner\nIn one by one they went and we can't do that and they walked away 'cause we're all sinful\nIn one by one they went and we can't do that and they walked away\n'cause we're all sinful we're all in the same level and then this woman is left alone with\nJesus who's writing in the sand who has taken all eyes off her in any other scenario this woman would have been taken out stone and probably killed\nRight\nAny other scenario of Christ wasn't there and so the woman was left alone with Jesus and he and he straightened up and Jesus said to her\nWoman where are they didn't know one condemn you and she said no one lord and Jesus said neither do I condemn you go your way from now on sending more\nThink about that\nNeither do I condemn you ghosts and no more you know we're taught really two things that ... these two integral things when you look at the Bible were taught this idea right Jesus comes forward\nAnd he says my joke is easy my burden is light and for those of you to you who don't know a yolk in the biblical times was a rod they put on the back of an ox center on the back of a person and then they put two palzer to wait sir to\nSomething on the side right that's how they carry things getting ... if you had to get water it was a natural thing you'd take a yolk you would put it over your shoulders are over the shoulder of an accent and then you put the two\nBuckets on the side with water in it and then Jesus Says that Jesus compares the laws of Moses in the Old Testament to that he was like that is a heavy yolk that as a heavy burden\nThat is a hard yoked that's a heavy burden but then he says my yolk is easy my burden is light love God and a lot of people\nAnd then when this woman is caught in the middle of a send in the middle of violating the laws of Moses\nJesus comes forward and he says look\nI'm the person that's going to take that place for you right look ahead who's the person that dies on the cross for your sins that Jesus so what does he say\nWoman where are they did no one condemn you she said no one word and he said to her neither do I condemn you go your way from now on sin no more\nAnd this is where we take this idea that we've been born again through belief in Jesus through the sacrifice that Jesus made if you take that in your heart\nYou are a new creation you go forward and use sin no more because if we're all help the standards of the Old Testament of the laws of Moses or all deserving of help because the laws of Moses we're supposed to make us\nLook and say we can't do this on our own but we need somebody that can help us so powerful message you haven't accepted Christ and your life would highly recommend it because his yolk is easy\nAll or what have the a case brought forward in a lower courts that would that spring\nCourt would be willing to hear ... and I I don't know of anything but I think at some point there will be\n... but uh your listeners need to understand that even if the court if the Supreme Court ruled a rosy weighed a overturn roe v Wade\nWould not and abortion which simply return the issue to the states where it was prior to Nineteen Seventy three mhm I'm you know states like New York California would be pro abortion states ... with the states would decide that not federal government mhm\nDo you think that attorney general Marshall will take the law out of Alabama that was a struck down by the eleventh circuit court here recently um now that Kavanaugh is confirmed that has to do with abortion during a specific trimester specifically ... do you think he'll take\nThat to the Supreme Court now because he was trying to decide on whether or not to launch an appeal do you expect something to happen now out of Alabama\nI Can't speak for what might happen with\nHe was trying to decide on whether or not to launch an appeal do you expect something to happen now out of Alabama\nI I Can't speak for what might happen with Alabama attorney general\nUm and so I Do want to ask a a second thing that the Kavanaugh\nA confirmation brought up with this idea um that we're seeing a lot of of the presumption of innocence versus mob mentality um what did you see during this Kavanaugh's confirmation than anything give you cause for pause that you hadn't seen before in American politics\nUm that was startling such as what a lot of people have said they've seen which is this mob rule that basically\nYou're just presumed guilty because the mob kind of comes after you\nWell I I've said that I've talked about this several times is the first of all as I said earlier I don't know what happened thirty seven years ago I don't know what he did or didn't do er\nAnd I'm so not nobody can and can say ... or you\nHave to have evidence to pursue a case in our entire justice system is predicated on the idea that that you're presumed innocent until proven guilty mhm uh your\nAssured due process if evidence warrants a trial your shirt or the trial by jury of your peers\nAre obviously none of that was recorded a justice Kevin ... and and nor was it accorded to a doctor for ... so I I think uh that is a tremendous threat and and and in that threat applies to everyone\nIf someone can come in and and say that something happened thirty forty years ago and you have a no way to prove or disprove anything\nAnd it could result and and someone losing their job or or in the case of justice Kevin I have your entire career\nCalled into question and destroyed\nAnd um that\nThat is an extraordinarily dangerous precedent but there's also something else here that that I think people need to take note of and that is is that um if they continue to do this they'll come a time when there is a legitimate victim who will not get justice because nobody will believe mhm\nKind of that it kind of that where you bring so many claims I don't want to say the boy they cried wolf but I totally understand what you're saying if they bring so many claims that aren't able to substantiate it than somebody who has substantiate Asian won't be hurt because people will become so desensitized us information\nAt that point I'm moving on a little bit I Do want to talk or specifically about something that is in the news now that's making 'em a lot of headlines and that is a President Trump's handling of a foreign policy issues so I'm just on that perspective just on that topic what do you think about\nHow he's handling current foreign policy issues are there things you do differently or are you liking the steps he's taking\nThe broad ... of\nA foreign policy is a very broad issue I mean we're talking about\nUm has handled our our war against terror mhm\nAnd how he got to do is look at ISIS or when he took office or the uh ISIS had been referred to by the previous administration President Obama\nAs the the JV team obviously it wasn't as they controlled a substantial part of northern Iraq in eastern Syria that had a school system that hospitals they rented engaging the international trade of those are selling oil stolen oil they were still selling\nSchool system that hospital they were in engaging international trade uh although it was or selling oil stolen oil they were still selling it across\nInternational boundaries mhm uh and yet now a Ninety five\nPercent that chair towards been reclaimed and ISIS has been relegated basically to the status of a terrorist organization so in that respect he's been extremely successful I think in terms of a\nA respect among the nations of the world that's been restored I think it's yet to be determined how this will work out when North Korea ... there is a dialogue going on\nI'm skeptical frankly I'd I'd be skeptical a regardless ... because uh uh ... not in a judgment of the event administration's ability to deal with this regime\nI'm skeptical of the regimes sincerity\nMhm I I think that uh this is something that I'm a we'll have to wait and see how it turns out\nWhat do you think they would stand again I'm curious about the north Koreans you sir well I\nThink there are other things going on North Korea that they don't get talked about I think there are a lot of defectors and uh and I think I'm a\nChina is is the principal player here and it's so ... what they would prefer is a much smaller presidents of the United states in the region particularly\nA removing nuclear weapons as a potential threat from a from the U.S in the region and small are a number of troops an airman and ah I'm from\nThe United states we have an army base there we have a an air force base there are no sign\nMhm so I think that that China has a played a role in this I don't think that uh come young and uh does anything without a frugal China frankly\nThere okay very good point you know the ultimate\nThing here would be that Kim Young on as a as looked at his country and decided that uh uh that he'd like to see the nation prosper but my guess is that would be way way down his list of priorities\nDefinitely makes sense he seems to be somebody that's motivated by what's best for him and his regime as opposed to what's best for the people the country\nSo we have to run to break my producers in my ear telling me we're about to go to break is there any way we can hold you over for one more segment 'cause I got a couple of more questions sure awesome well thank you again for joining us we'll put you on hold

through what they called a a a hasty search over the weekend which is just looking for a media sort of a survivors and then of course the or the exploratory teams came in behind them but Mexico beach in Mexico beach was you know it's kind of old Florida if you've never been there in the sense that\nEvery structure wise either cinder block or cinder block in wood or just would\nNow a lot of the structures that were up on pilings did in fact survive but Mexico beach is also part of that's off that part of Florida we have a lot of locals you have a lot of people that are have retired you know the area\nIt is out probably twenty five years behind Panama City in terms of its growth which meant that it was still very affordable portion of the coastline but to talk about sad I mean it literally just gone no matter where you look and it's heartbreaking and I was talking to a to tc over the weekend\nAnd uh you know I made a comment I said you know I've got because I've been here a Crawford for so long\nI've got a whole bag full of a vacation days than I have my disposal I said you know maybe I just it burned two or three of my vacation days this week or next week by myself and a chainsaw and head to the coast I mean just I have this compulsion to do something I Know there's probably ill advised\nOr on my part but it is absolutely heartbreaking for those of us\nThat have spent time in that area whether it's Mexico major port saint Joe or an especially over a tourist St George island which is the fate and kid rock as a place down on on St George absolutely gorgeous stretch of land\nAnd I just it breaks my heart to think of the destruction it might have occurred down there and it's not even a hundred percent known in Mexico beach will come back as we know it\nBecause many of the uh foundations that were their closest to the water you know they're no longer build up all the the the beaches are gonna have to be completely re done that's where the Army Corps of engineers is going to come in and there is an awful lot of work to be done down there and it's going to take\nProbably the better part of a decade were still recovering from Katrina to some degree\nSo I was going to be very very very long arduous and a lot going on down there\nAnd I mean there's still some areas are still ... ... so long ago they're still making sure and put new CEOs out there to make sure the saying is don't wash away right and ... years ago and they're going to do the exact same thing next go\nThey're still making sure and put new CEO out there to make sure the sand dunes don't wash away right and ... years ago and they're going to do the exact same thing ... beach if you look at the pictures\nIt just goes to show you not always just the when that was the storm surge that came and took everything out if you look at some of the pictures like we saw last week\nPart of the bees looked like the Dover cliff right we'll just let your straight down other ones the beach he rode is so much he went underneath the road and the roads just gone and done that area of um\nNorth side of Mexico beach split in half just like Frederick did the Gulf shores\nThat's um Cape send blast yeah All right\nWell you know ... years ago when me and my high school friends would go down to Panama City and we didn't quite frequently\nAfter Camille in Nineteen sixty nine there was a building that was being constructed condominiums or Ninety eight and it was on the beat side\nAnd they do longer deemed it safe now it has since been built out we referred to that building and a lot of people might know what I'm Talking about if you can go down there any length of time as the dead building it was literally the concrete structure now it has now been built into condominiums but that thinks that in a state of\nOf all of repair if you will because they weren't certain if it was a structurally sound for the better part of about Thirty years and I'm Serious as I can be about that and so you're going to have some of those situations now unlike Panama City\nMexico beach did not have a lot of high rise structures it was mostly these old wouldn't you know the whole the um\nAh the houses are like that disgusting ... green ... to ... yeah the little bungalows or their baby blue or whatever that's what Mexico base look like and a lot of the ah the little hotels are like in Panama city's replaced and they're called um\nAh the kiss good court or the Barney gray hotel it was like the Nineteen fifties sixties version and so in that we're talking down around um a spin occur Thomas drive in that area way back from a day back in the eighties seventies and eighties\nThat's what Mexico beach looked like as recently as last week it's going to be very tough to recover from that for years to come however the president will be terrain in that area no word on whether or not he's going to be in Alabama because obviously Florida is the one that got hit the most\nBut Trump is expected to be in that part of Florida as well as Georgia throughout the course of the day I seriously doubt is going to be anything to report from that\nNo reports on whether or not he will look at at a residents of Mexico beach and uh remind them that well armed president because that's what he did\nOver the weekend with Lesley Stahl on sixty minutes\nAh she was trying from what I now I didn't watch the thing 'cause I'm I'm sick and tired of sixty minutes and all these you know it's up there with SNL\nYeah but from what I saw on Twitter she kept trying to back him into a corner and he kept coming out swing and now they're back and knock on her back and knock on her back he was on the well the\nThe the video you see of Mohammed Ali sitting there the guys trying to rope a dope stuff yeah he's just sitting there going back and forth back and forth yeah that's what I got from Twitter anyways and and my snapshot and I don't I don't think a lot of people\nRealize that\nDonald Trump gets off on this kind of stuff I mean he ... it reminds me of Sunday afternoon dinner after we got out of mass\nAnd my grandmother was at the house into her scotch and all of a sudden it started a fly because my grandmother she pick a fight with anybody 'cause you know might you know the the classic white picket fence chicken frying\nFly because my grandmother she pick a fight with anybody because

came out about New York creative culture\nYou've got to pledge mothers should have been out of here months ago and but she's tried to pin him down and I it it almost makes me wonder why Trump even put themselves in these situations because you know it's coming but all these things are just set up his jobs but\nNow she watch enterprise to fire Mueller who's in the year to\nHave an investigation into collusion between Trump and Russia\nDrop it on to say I don't pledge anything but I Will tell you I have no intentions of doing that I think it's very unfair investigation because there's no collusion
