decision more I kind of agree with that to a point in it it it brings me to a point I see a lot of people get married\nWhen they can't financially support themselves right I see a lot of people getting married and a lot of them are getting married a mommy and daddy dime and here's my thing if you're getting married and then moving into an apartment that your parents are helping you pay for\nI'm of the old school belief that I think you shouldn't get married if you're moving in and you can't pay for the apartment you can't pay for the bills you can't pay for you can't support your spouse I think you're just plain dress up I think he's just playing house you're not that's not a real marriage I mean the state says it is but\nI mean what are you doing just living together I mean I mean I honestly and maybe this is just my old school beliefs I don't think you should get married until you can support that marriage why would you enter into something that you can't support the same thing with a kid I mean it's the same argument I make in everyone's like you can't teach abstinence anymore\nI mean I I'd say only do it inside of marriage but if you're going to engage in sexual activity outside of marriage better be ready to support that get because guess what's an obvious\nOn set against what's an obvious result of sexual activity shark or it's a kid just what's an obvious thing that comes with marriage shocker it's supporting yourself\nAnd supporting the person that you said hey now we're a team\nYeah but apparently that's a flood concept at this point to society I

six by by one Ninety nine thirty three it is what it is it is you are allowed to be openly hated if you are white or men in this society I think that's fair\nAnd if you're a white man you're doubly allowed to be hated double double double trouble eight six six by by one Ninety nine thirty three but you know what I say to that if somebody's ignorant enough to hate you because of the color of your skin or the parts you got downstairs you know what you say you say okay well\nI don't need you we don't need you in a civil society and you just continue on because I don't understand how that has become normative\nHowever we normalized hatred I loved it the people that come across with the hate right towards white men are the same people that says Republicans and conservatives are the party of slavery and you know do the one they're the ones go in and saying we need reparations for slavery still\nMen are the same people that says Republicans and conservatives are the party of slavery and you know the one they're the ones go in and saying we need reparations for slavery still in slavery is awful because we hate white men and it's like white women that are saying this I'm like I don't think you understand how your statements\nIn sentiment are the most hypocritical thing possible you're saying because of something because because of the fact that a group was marginalized because of the color of their skin we're going to intern attempt to marginalize and hate another group\nBecause of the color of their skin or the genitalia they got downstairs and their argument doesn't even make any sense because then they that's also the same group of people that comes out and says genders on a spectrum\nSo how do you hate white males\nIf you can decide whether you're a male or a woman so the next time somebody goes I don't like you 'cause you're a white male I'm going to say well are you assuming my gender 'cause I'm a white woman\nI'm actually an all white attack helicopter for

know or if you ask me in a public forum like I'll I'll definitely respect you but if you say if you demand that I changed my pronoun usage when you are born with the chromosome count that denotes man\nYou know we're born with a chromosome count the votes woman or don't ask me to publicly changed my pronoun usage of you it's just it's nonsensical you are born with your gender and you'll be addressed as such but it's still a respect thing I'm not going to disrespect you that's where I think people take it too far as when they disrespect ah\nPeople because the way they choose do I ... when it's blatant disrespect I don't think you should conform your views but don't blatantly disrespect but the same time we're told you can literally be whatever you want\nWhy is Asian on on the

woman\nYeah\nThat doesn't shock me though eight six six five five one my main I Am thirty three so what do you think about Andrea's question because everybody's kind of danced around that and I think it's a good question what do you think about the question is monogamy possible or or\nI'm Sorry our question was is monogamy possible in the modern society hers was is a modern society possible without monogamy because my stance would be to get the free market you know the free market maybe would allow for some adaptation and some change\nThat would potentially we would learn how to adapt without monogamy what do you think from a non biblical perspective\nThe current society would not exist without monogamy yeah because there is such a stigma about being monogamous yeah\nThat is that where to go way they'd be such a significant portion of a ... society that would be forced to change that we wouldn't recognize it after that change not talking about a force change I'm saying what if our minds\nUh you know God willing if I got the money I can go out and I can purchase a car and I think that's a commitment that's a lot less serious than committing\nTo be with somebody as marriage vows say until death do us part I just think those are two\nEntirely different commitments I think I can commit to taking out a bank loan and saying yeah I'll pay you back um but I Do see where you're coming from Michael in it's a very good point\nEight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is number to join the conversation or find me on Facebook Baylor cook origin messages on their let's go out to skip docked on line one skip doc how you doing\nHere on the morning I I I agree with that go on I think that um\nSociety can a free society could absorb a very different lifestyles a monogamous turn on monogamous or\nYou know historically a monogamy was really um an economic uh matter or a ... sure that um [noise] uh your your efforts\nYeah I'm an economic uh matter or a to ensure that um [noise]\nUh your your efforts were put into a marriage to look after kids children mind you\nThat belong to both the that sound you understood you know the genetic background yeah this is why a lot a lot of animals are are monogamous because it ... it makes certain about the genetic background being they understand the the chromosome or make up but\nThey do it in many different ways one animals actually ensure monogamy by smell is they can actually smell or partner a and to make sure that the partners not messing around the literary a sense of smell is but\nThere was right I think humans as well\nBut I I think that one's right I think the ... and you're right it's also Baylor I think the free market\nUh by way of a a a new contracts are and bite with technology I think that we don't have to get married necessarily we don't have to go through these religious ceremonies in Greece pseudo promises that a lot of people can't uh\nCan't keep but I think that a free\nNow I don't I I Am going to push back there I don't think there's pseudo promises I think a lot of people are able to keep those promises I'm well that's\nThat's true yeah that's true\nAnd I do think when I make a promise you know uh and you aren't able to keep it right I wouldn't call it a fake promised I wouldn't say because it gets a fake promise I Would say you went in with bad intentions\nI Would just say that a lot of people went in with the intentions of this is going to last forever and then as the previous caller pointed out at seven years you know you're just kind of like ah this this really ain't working out\nYeah ... but I think a ... by way of contract there would be some some real from a\nA vigilance and there'd be some consequences when people go into these religious or contracts they have this kind of\nA panic up say they believe that you know were sinners and we were expected this than were expected to ask for forgiveness\nUm you know we have ... different compounds but contracts are different uh you know contracts are really a can be monitored with technology and and the consequences are hard and fast and farm and so I think that uh\nThis is why you know if if you are dealing with care to research this is why are actually Christians\nHave a higher rate of divorce than atheists\nBecause the sea is a I think they they don't have this fallback position of monogamy I think it's it's very important to realize that uh the the marriage is held together by a kind of a sticky glue that you know it's kind of nebulous\nAnd uh it's it's not really is from is a contract ah I I think that uh if we would just get rid of a this concept of state and forced marriages and uh\nHe's an unheard of expectations with these cop out fallback position I think society would actually be better off we'd be far better off\nIf we would just move away from these uh I dated a ineffective\nAnd disappointing uh relationships is disappointing uh arrangements and just I just do a lot lot with a lot of the free market with free mines and free hearts and free cans to decide how they want to people to come together and I think we have more peace to have more productivity\nThe hearts and free cans to decide how they want to people to come together and I think we have more peace we'd have more productivity wouldn't have divorce lawyers\nOr the the the the two the two I'm\nA people come into the contract\nWith a very vigilant to be very careful about setting it up instead of just jumping into a marriage like that you now you're both New York quite correct the marriages are too easy to get in shape much too easy and it's very complicated and destructive get out of these marriage I especially if you have kids\nI Do want to correct you because I think you're misusing statistics are that you cited previously were you said Christians are the most divorced or separated adults and I'm looking at the Pew Research for him\nAnd you are correct the Christians are the most separated 'em in comparison to all other religions existent in the United states in fact it's Seventy four percent but when you look at the population data I think it's I think it's incredibly misleading because of the population down in comparison from Christianity to atheism is Seventy point six percent\nAs opposed to a three point one percent so there's no way just based on sheer population data that we could expect those um faith sets a and I would call atheism a face that that we could um expect those to be on the same level just based on sheer population down\nWhile I disagree with you it doesn't really matter what the numbers are matters of the percentages and rates I agree with the atheists are probably ... percent I agree with you completely but I'm not interested in the numbers so that people in the country or ... percent of the population I'm interested in\nHow do these groups actually act when you look at them and they there's a there's a there's a survey done by a actually a Christian\nOr the origin called George barring a B. A. R. and I'll have to go and look it up\nYeah and it showed quite clearly that are Christians\nUh had a a a higher rate of divorce than it is actually strangely enough it was actually higher than the Bible the Bible belt Alabama Tennessee and Kentucky I mean sure we we we claimed this was the Bible belt but we have more divorces than the other parts of the country\nA lot of these some of these two nations the or ... you know evangelical short kings of homosexuality and divorce these people have an incredibly high rate of divorce\nOf two and I don't know why are they separate things don't equate um when I I don't want to get into I really\nI well I mean you ... you know I don't know you made the equivalency and the equivalency is false so those are two entirely different things to be against willing to be against another is two completely different concepts\nWhat am I guess\nYou said you said that you group to homosexuality and divorced within the same fear and they're not in the same sphere you you said ... that are against from a from apple I'm an evangelical the does in support of gay marriage but I Do think you should stick it out in a marriage as long as you possibly can I'm against the idea of just divorce is a first whim\nWell I'm just saying that you know these people who are who claim that add adult free homosexuality or divorced\nAgain all these aren't the same thing you're you're giving a incredibly false equivalency\nOr by but if but if you look at the platform of these people have\nI mean look at look at look at the uh look at the pass just look at all these pastors who ... who are the leaders in these denominations insects look at what the extent to other to women to to their bank accounts they've\nYou know ... and and uh I really think that these institutions whether it's state or any other ...\nYou know ... and and uh I really think that the institutions whether it's state or any other ... eventually it starts running from inside including marriage and I think that we should really open up we should really encourage people\nTo use a free market while we still have it use contracts use technology to a better relationship\nAnd fish by itself would that our society we would have a more peaceful\nDucks as a society if we would just to go out to um move away from the state run institutions\nThese programs these traditions that um have kind of becomes petrified and they become fossilized and they just are are so rich and now people are breaking away from them and up and move away from that go towards\nThe veterans more got you got there they're going to college in a\nResidual eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is a number to join the conversation going it's eight six six\nFive five one Ninety nine thirty three I don't think that's a result of an institution existing for a long time right and I think that was the um false premise that was set forth by get back I think rather it is ... there was a human element in any human institution\nRight and what corrupt more human elements than anything on earth is this element of greed which does exist in a free market um and so I Do think that human greed is what corrupts people like for example I I Believe he's referencing these mega pastors right that have\nI think the fact that you can divorced somebody and then you all can both marry somebody else and demand typically still has to pay what is it alimony or not Charles for alimony um I think that's ridiculous and a failed and sisters and I don't know I just think every single state touches is really bad and I want them out of my bedroom and out of my life as much as\n... by one Ninety nine surgeries to my heart when it comes around us all it is human presented by yo AM radio mature to go check out you'll have a news dot com\n[noise]\nThere'll be ... there'll be ...

probably about a week away from large you name brand new podcast related to some of the things we'll be talking about on the program and certainly a lot of the history that we talked about on the program so I keep an eye on the website Michael heart show dot com micro heart show dot com the pod cast on fire off\nMaybe as early as this rate trying to get some of the um final technology dealt with\nSo we'll be doing that and your whole surprises in ... we have up our sleeves so that's going to be a destination\nOf you guys in coming weeks and hopefully mountaineers or keep an eye on that as well eight six six five five one nine nine three three of us start with Harlan hey Harlan how are you\nI'm great Michael and it's wonderful to be back in Alabama I just returned from about a month on the road a wonder related so in my travels I headed out west\nLaid on us so\nAs I ... through Missouri and I got up in Montana and I got to listen to\nA like McCaskill tester their political ads and you would have thought they were the only two people are coming down the pipe will support veterans and you would have thought they were going to go down and with their own hands close the order or their political ads\nYeah that's something that James and I have picked apart several times in the past these guys out there that are you know they're running for ah the county school board on a Second Amendment platform\nYou know I mean I I\nI Can't get my head around that I really can't but it's it's interesting that are that it seems to be happening across the country\nYes now a a real quick anecdote and moms and I'm sixty three years old I went to a sports bar and I got carded\nAnd I should\nBut in Montana I'm sixty three years old I watch sports\nBar and I got carded and I said\nWhat happened in the wild wild west you know and I still I don't get a card in Alabama is let you know that when I was out in California um I I've been going on while I don't know if that's a nickname for San Francisco has made it this this far east\nAre out there they call it and she she still\nUh because of all the human species in the streets\nUm they also have a ballot initiative out there for trolls so if you own your own home or your home and you're renting it out they're going to tell you how much you can charge are basically in perpetuity or because of the housing crisis is so horrible um\nAnd I guess I just wanted to just say I I almost moved to Alabama by choice or and I and I all I almost teared up when I got very good I'll just say\nWell welcome home\nAnd thank you and this great in the morning and you guys have a great day\nYou too which is very much Harlan\nYeah as you as you travel around this country it really does benefit people tremendously to kind of get out and about ten or just see the way the world operates outside of the fear of off the University of Alabama you know many times I talk to you about and did it friday as a matter of fact\nYou know being on a plane somewhere and meaning to find out that uh I'm from Alabama and just the responses are\nCute cute cute cute ... sweet yeah\nBut it is interesting and I guess somewhat to a degree even a\nComforting to know that the whacking is well it's a pretty much a permeates all aspects of American soldier because there's a lot of it out there but then again you know you look at these rallies that Donald Trump continued to be on his rally Torre\nAnd people coming out by the tens of thousands whereas you've got a\nYou know that the movement mama and uh and uh her events where you know they're having a bus people in and of course you know ... has like fifty seven people show up in the last one that he conducted in and uh it's just it's it's so funny it is so funny to watch this stuff\nYeah I'm tired and\nApparently he's not even talking to me well no I'm I'm reading the story about the goodwill workers you know you did you see the story out of New Jersey ... the goodwill worker Fonda original Seventeen Seventy four newspaper with United a political cartoon in donation been very nice\nAnd good will work or in southern New Jersey stumbled upon it feels framed\nYou know the United not political cartoon on top of one of the printed newspapers paper it was found in a donation box by workers who were tasks to pulling out valuable and high end items and I guess they do the same kind of weird\nSo ... it's estimated between six and sixteen thousand dollars they expect the value to go up though because the two hundred fifty in the universe is coming up right and right now they're looking for either the original owner or they're looking for a collector or I guess you could say\nNot to restore but somebody who\n\nShows off I I don't want to say like an antique place or an auction hollering but they're looking for somebody to get it and take care of it\nRight so I Wish I Would have found that yeah mhm but um yeah I got I got four guys in here\nSo they're looking for somebody to get it and take care of it right\nSo I Wish I Would have found that yeah mhm but no\nI got I got four guys in here all of his looking at their phones may deserve their shopping for a new song for the spring they got to deal with an airplane Fortnite and that James over here just looking to to take out whatever space he can possibly take I'm just looking up stories that aren't about\nPolitics I'm not buying a new song for the spring I just purchased a a sweatshirt on a ... that says limited edition grandpa so that's my new sweatshirt for three dollars coming in not mine songs Michael that doesn't\nHave limited edition grandpa no it wasn't the rose up I mean\nI don't know I'm a limited edition grandpa but the song shopping comes later in the season\nMm okay Mm Mm Mm yeah the the millennial and\nGot that right All right so what else we got on our radar\nMaxine Waters and bombs scared a bomb bomb threat I ain't scared quote Missouri science scared yeah um\nAnd what about the whole pipe bomb thing because you know all of a sudden all of the um oh the the conspiracy theories ... started to abound about that and of course you know we talked about it briefly last week it was more of a a late afternoon story\nAs we know that the uh the bombers van was covered up and Trump stickers and you know that that that by the way is what stimulated the or the lovely back and forth between me and my oldest sister and how ignorant are wise because\nDonald Trump has an entire league Jim ... has a fleet of white vans that are conveniently decorated in pro Trump anti liberal stickers that travel all over the United states of America\nAnd uh that you know of course there was the ... the bumper sticker on the backs of sources the man and\nSo they're driving all over drop it off these ah these pipe bombs killing babies they'd taken care of everybody out here and uh it's just so amazing to me and I'm watching this stuff on on Twitter I'm going to have to like do a moratorium on my Twitter feed or something because ignorance is just every time I get on Twitter I feel like my I ... down a point or two\nWhen you got the pipe bomb going on then you've got the shooting up in uh the synagogue up in Pennsylvania and people were quick quick to point to a Trump supporter\nWhen you go in his Twitter feed her Facebook page and he railed against Trump he railed against the embassy move in Israel you went to Trump supporting bass Trump very sick and he got well\nYou know that's kind of was stimulated the or the back and forth between she and I was house so much of what's going on the country and and this ... this by the way it was pretty synagogue\nTalking about how so much of the rhetoric from Donald Trump the oval office the White House is what is stimulating these attacks\nBut then you know I came back with her and I said okay I tell you what happened if I send you some interesting quotes from Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton or you know of course all Spartacus or Maxine Waters and the crickets for days\nBecause it's it's it's so funny how so many people seem to be able to compartmentalize their viewpoints on things and they ... they will utilize\nI don't know evidence that they themselves have\nWithout realizing that in fact most of this is stimulated from their camp but how in the world they can just\nIntellectually dismissed that is mind numbing to me\nIs it really\nI mean it kind of is I mean in the face look if these things were not so well no if they were just kind of in the shadows\nOkay but they're everywhere I mean Hillary Clinton is doing her continue that are who are ah oh woe is me to or it's all over ... ah NBC it's all over Fox has all over CNN how can you not know I used that far displaced from reality\nIt's all over ... ah NBC it's all over Fox has all over CNN\nHow can you not know are you that far just place from reality show how in the world can you not know these things are occurring and how can you avoid them while using evidence to point to me telling me that I'm some kind of ... raised his big it when I wasn't even a Trump supporter in the early days\nAnd again I'm a fiscal conservative and more of a social or center right moderate when it comes to social issues so you know all of a sudden the arm painted with the Trump brush where you know in years past he's been one of the largest contributors to democratic campaigns in New York's history\nHello how can you just it's like I remember when I only\nMatters my parents' comments only matter when you were on the Republican ticket or a conservative ticket for that matter when your democratic because when you're a Democrat in the next thing you say just replaces your previous comment right serving stops\nHateful Xena followed nurses says and I just don't understand where that comes from it was completely ginned up if you know George Soros is that they're cranking out bumper stickers I don't get the deranged rent Anthony can you explain that to us\nWell I mean you know sort of what he plays into you know one of the reasons why he called me yesterday I was on the more you know on friday night\nThe president got big kick out of the ... you might performance on the bill Maher show his aunt that you get it you know you sometimes you get a copy of his rhetoric and he will sometimes say certain things that he knows which for good behavior\nFrom the mainstream media or trickle behavior on the left so so ah he uses that as a distraction mechanism you know the the great hired and you're like is it they\nPicked up on what he did\nThey would change their strategy and start to focus on the working class family in the middle class families that the president's focused on that instead of doing that or they want to spend time on checking him to conflate the situation will met and\nAre doing disaster as violent things but some scribe with the president said\nSo he sort of very good job of deflecting them into areas where the average American really just back here\nAnd he's going to be out there continually focus on\nEveryday people and the common struggle that we have here now the teams with Wall Street journal reported about three weeks ago at the bottom\nTen percent of the society is experience about a five and a half percent wage clean since the implementation of of the president's policies and so it's working I'm an upset about it and I think they're in their ... frankly\nIs only to increase to just not clear to me that he lives in the house and they say he he he could come out of this with the historic victory in the in the midterms are they all really see a somebody that's on the left\nCan you give us a little bit of insight into his personality ... a pre presidency and and what I'm asking is you know over the years you know he kind of ... he was in that orbit\nOr or the the liberal Democrat New York laughed and you know here in the deep south I mean my first draw from New York I understand New Yorkers but in the deep south is kind of this a New York city mentality that some kinds sometimes permeates thought and I'm just curious is that\nYou know has Donald Trump had some kind of a cathartic awakening in the last few years or was that always part of his psyche to reach out to people when you were not the vending machines so I'm assuming that has always been on these types of this reached out to others\nI think are the real question I tried to chronicle that in my book I I take a of people through\nA fried Trump's orange and how we got it and then I take people through President Trump's life in his twenties thirties forties his rise and fall you know he had to declare bankruptcy and for companies\nAre and he was an insolvent position there are in the early nineties when some of his casinos were belly up\nAnd talk about his struggle and has its own memorial\nIn stone ... started getting it to go back in the lecture that he wanted to do the force of his oil on the nation is a little ... so in that entire period of time and I only for Twenty years\nThis is a guy with older men and New York city show for so many people are have gravitated to this is a guy from um aids or in his hotels uh\nHad gravitated to this guy from um aids or in his hotels a or a quarter of it you will also I got pretty close to some of the service is covering the campaign or the few of them even in the White House\nA lot on on the one who wants to get a little ...\nSo so that the great irony here is that uh the demonization is good business for some of the media outlets and it's good business for some of the\nDemocratic or left wing politicians but\nBut it's not it's not the it's not the truth there was a very big disconnect between what he really is like as a person and how these people would like to portray him and how people perceive them and so I tried to do a very good job in the book\nThe least exposing that and explaining it from my vantage point because I grew up in a blue collar family\nEven though I've had some great measure of success and live a large part of the American dream um I can explain why my cousins who are climbing out on Long Island all the glass or there are working in Delhi's and pizzeria is why they love the guy\nUm and it it it's pretty much you can take that cross section throughout the country I mean he's a very broad base blue collar support\nWherever the conversation with Anthony Scaramucci he's the author of Trump the blue collar president Anthony because I got more questions for you and I appreciate your papa by this morning to a very very very much very appreciative of where we get before we get to where I went to the kind of a a you know [noise] pontificate if you will for just to remember what do you see happening in a week from tomorrow\n[noise] well you know listen I think I think this guy gets on the edge it can be in it you know he he's a guy it's going to make probably eleven twelve more campaign stops are in the next eight days\nAnd he's a guy that has figured out by galvanizing his base you can increase voter participation and so one of the big problems that mid term\nElections have had for presidents is that they're in power and their voters are quite complaints that the other side is not in power and their votes are quite angry and so they they turned out not but he is figuring out\nDeployment of mechanisms over the last say five to six weeks which could cause a very big groundswell of turnout for him you know we used to say during the campaign might\nWe'd be outside of the civic center watching people wait on line how long you been there for seven eight nine hours president once said to me hey if they've been outside the civic center for nine hours waiting for a speech you think they're not showing up on election day right and so so so the point being is that the I think it's gonna be way closer\nAnd the pundit say a Nate Silver to eighty six percent chance that the Democrats will take the house he had those same numbers for Hillary Clinton going into election day two years ago and I just think the president is not somebody to get the unrest\nAnthony before I let you get back to work I got to ask a question and I'm going to go out on a on a limb here by myself because many of my\nColleagues my peers here at the station you don't necessarily agree with that\nAnd over the years we've had the opportunity to speak to some really great fired for good friends with people like Laura Ingraham colder and\n... kind of sort of slightly supports my view him as a culture completely disagrees with me and I asked her a couple of weeks ago if the president and I'd states tweets just a little bit too much and the reason I'm asking that\nIs because there have been times where he's put traits that Rogers going oh dear God why does he have to say that but then I'm starting to wonder maybe he's not broken that they're just a little bit but are there are there any times were Anthony Scaramucci would say the president\nYou have to say that but then I'm starting to wonder maybe he's not broken that they're just a little bit but are there are there any times were Anthony Scaramucci would say the president may be adjusted our role that back or is there really some ah madness to the methodology that seems to be working and his benefit or do you think sometimes that maybe he could just keep it more closer to the vast\nWell I I had that intellectual discuss ... some of that I wanted to have in the book something on the campaign and shake our heads and then he ... many of us who say no completely not all that's right it was but you know and any chance it's all\nSo I I saw this in how he\nHad that marketing genius to use Twitter during the campaign or if you are listening to your video ... personally you know as well among the\nCable stations always told by about\n... you had the support out there and get the independent any doubted that just a sliver ... up in the polls I'll just give you one quick thing before we go about the three weeks of justice cab and I was under the spotlight or the president was it was all that which is all of us wants to hold the key to all these have said so\nSo less of that sort of stuff\nPeople start focusing on how well the country's doing all the economy's doing well how all the ... or delay\nThat's very very good for so all I Am in that camp and ultimately like eating like\nAn idiot [laughter] yeah a little more self editing on\nWell you see she actually made the comment that he should get rid of a Sarah Huckabee and just take over the communications department of himself and you know ... and see and I've always we've not had several times over the years the name of the book is Trump the blue collar president by Anthony Scaramucci have they are saying that the book is available to all the usual suspect the places\nA lot of little ... all that so they ask you about\nA little bit of ... was looking for the whole like at my fingers crossed for like two ... Poland to uh uh getting out of his ... and I'm very grateful but you\nKnow they they it was my honor was my privilege and we appreciate it so very much edited Scaramucci again the name of the book is Trump they blue collar president you all go check it out and then he thank you so much for your time\nTake care of it you two\nQuick break come right back Bob Norcross joins us in Studio ... answering your cause James texting or whatever it is he does on the Michael archer\nSaving this tribute Michael has his doodle\nIt's a good day on superficial one oh one what do you want to give you\nThe following it does not necessarily reflect the opinions or views have proper broadcasting its employees affiliates or advertisers", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Guys", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "29"}
