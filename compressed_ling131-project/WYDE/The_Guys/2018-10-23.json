I feel like seeking asylum is synonymous with escaping the hell\nRight if we're just going to break it down in layman's terms what are you trying to do when you seek asylum you're scraping the hell are you currently\nGaping the hell right if we are just going to break it down in layman's terms what are you trying to do when you seek asylum you're scraping the hell are you currently live in once you've escape the hell don't you stop\nOr do you continue to press forward why not stop in Mexico once you've already escaped the hell why not look for asylum in Mexico why instead push forward to the United states does that say something\nDifferent about the intentions of the people that are coming\nTo the United states and we haven't even talked about the fact of how they got into Mexico and the first place\nBut I Want to get your phone calls first eight six six five five one\nNine thirty three again that's eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three let's go to Josh on line one Josh how you doing\nGood morning fellas your morning\nHere's the thing with this little migration heard of people coming up as a military person this is us all\nYoung men military man yeah that are led in fraud or women in a small group of women and children what Israel\nThat pass through multiple countries that could have gave him asylum Mexico being included as they got in Mexico they can be an asylum you know\nI wouldn't classify this is a migration of people seeking asylum our class fathers as an invasion\nI I agree I think this was an invading force especially did you see the way they came into Mexico literally forcing their way past the Mexican border by force\n[noise] yeah yeah and that's that's I mean so I think it's ... it's not going to be forceful going begging you to take it exactly\nI mean if and plus if they they hate their country so much why is it that they're flying flags of their country as their markings words are\nExactly I mean it just it doesn't make any sense and I did see this amazing picture\nBecause there are thousands upon thousands of people marching in this and they have the flag up in the front and the question is what would a force like this do if they marched on their own government and demanded what they want\nInstead of marching to another country\nThey might actually get something done you know we have actually get something productive does yup\nThere's a lot of loopholes that are being bussed in this story right now and they just continue to grow as it continues to be like a sponge they're just more and more holes found\nWhat laughing is uh like I said if I feel like as an invasion force and what we have an invasion force coming a novel they wish to protect our border with whatever is necessary\nI ... I mean it is a direct attack on our attack on our rights are laughing I agree I agree entirely I appreciate your brother I have going for\nYou to eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation ... so Joe disagree to me last night right he said it wasn't an invasion because he made kind of a parallel that in an invasion is a successful invasion right because I said\nOkay what if we stormed the beaches enormity right what happened on D Day what if we stormed the beaches enormity and didn't make it past the beaches what does that happen is that still considered an invasion and he said well no because you didn't invade\nI was like but I think the active attempting to invade is still an attempted invasion it's still an invasion and therefore you have to protect your borders against it and chose a military guy\nI think to invade is still an attempted invasion it's still an invasion and therefore you have to protect your borders against it and does a military guy so I set up the scenario I said okay imagine this imagined to your station as a ... as a military personnel in South Korea\nNow say there are people from North Korea\nThat come down in a large group\nThere's a large group of them there is a force of them right\nLet's call them before she got so there's a large group of them they come down to the border right they go across the demilitarized zone separating north and South Korea and they don't ask for asylum rather instead they push past\nThe guards\nStanding on the south Korean border they enter South Korea by force is that people seeking asylum or is that people invading the country eight six six\nFive five one Ninety nine thirty three is the number to join the conversation again it's eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three let's go out to Murph on line to mark how you doing\nI'm Still trying to get over the person they eat first egg yeah\nYeah yeah yeah I wouldn't be doing ...\nOut of it but I'm going to eat it yeah I'm I'm with and he was saying with milk\nShot out the anti Andrews Air that was a\nThat was something from one of his comedy routines many years ago but anyways yeah I hear your definition of asylum is not correct and neither is the last\n... if you're seeking asylum there is there is an imminent an immediate threat upon your life now so you have a political dissident somebody who writes an article\nYou know chastising the the government of whatever particular country they're in and suddenly the leader of the country says well I Want that person kill yeah and you find out you go seek asylum\nYeah well that's that's typical asylum is I was using what our society is saying now is a sign them which is almost synonymous with refugee status at this point they're pretty much on in the same\n... right but the refugee term has been played out example is laid out the refugee term so they gotta switch to something else to make it seem like they're running from something and poverty is not an imminent threat on your life from another individual that's I mean it's a bad situation correct but\nYou know it's something that if you work hard enough you can rectify it on your own to get out of your way dependent\nUpon the government in place of a say I don't think you could in Venezuela like I I don't think that's possible there but I I Do see what you're saying\nBut but this this is ... and they may not be carrying weapons although at this point a bunch of 'em probably arsons people from Mexico right now is\nJoining their uh their South American and Central American brothers there yeah and not to mention the ones carrying drugs but this this is weapons or no weapons this was a military threats yeah and while they may not be officially sanctioned by particular government\nBut rather large majority has pointed out by previous caller do not have their families with them it's just women and children at the front of the pack and then it's almost all men from there on [noise]\nOkay and when you get these folks would they would all made at the end of the day where if you want to give away I work for your family for someone and back to your family you're gonna miss or you're gonna go to the United states of America\nThat and that's in there if you're seeking asylum you're going to suffer in this go out with you but if you want something more than ... you're going to the U.S they are not coming here for asylum at oh man you talk about ... I I don't believe that that's a loophole United says America we got to fix these people are coming here to full whatever we got here and discuss or doesn't offer them for free or whatever\nAnd for a job that's why they're coming here not as common like I said it's so thick ... but at the end of the day go it\nBut if you really want that those jobs right if they're coming here and specifically for economic economic you don't get a job by warming a country storming the border by force that's not how you can read on how you get a job\nI agree I agree and death and death will be at the stuff you see the water but once they get through the war what are we truly going through this yeah how are we going to shoot him\nI don't know what the rules of engagement are that's all I was wanting somebody in the military ... that knows the rules of engagement on the border to ...\nBut what I'm saying you know the rules of engagement saying okay if they're trying to come into our country\nOther days when I was like oh I was wanting somebody in the military ... that knows the rules of engagement on the border to Cleveland\nBut what I'm saying you know the rules of the gate and saying okay if they're trying to come into our country for that right you are Americans going to stand by and let 'em look here so I assume down in the secret trying to come in\nWell if they're invading the country I don't think they're innocent\nPeople were sampling their invading the country for ... I don't think they're in a\nFocus on that myself\nI'm a I mean I I don't know what I Do I don't know what the protocol is there but I just I'm not I don't think you know it's either hot styles are innocent people I think they're they are trying to push through by force so I don't think we should allow that because of the country without lawyers are in the country\nYou know I agree with you understand we've got to pick up on a river water you know but are we going to do it and it's rather than dogs up to about enemies ... yeah\nI guess the main question of boils down to is how how's it going to protect them\nExactly because when he woke up across the border are you going to push and what you want to pay them you know what I'm saying if you go on strike because we can't lock them all at once that we can't you have to have a number of all the votes so realistically I was safe for us to talk of mystical\nAnd meet these people for they get here and help them do whatever they need to do what it mystical but when it gets awful you know\nI I mean it it it would be an interesting interesting thing had happened or what do you think about the timing of it\nI think some of those last like are you a Democrat to help them through with it I don't know what if and stuff like that Hungary where people you know say doing this or that they can probably get some of the groups and give you ... on the side of it is yeah of course you know but it is it a self in the United states\nThat we plant from one side of that I Can't believe that\nIf they ever have any evidence of that but these other countries no about us in this country and how we operate when I was of course they plan on their mental I think you\nKnow I was just saying yeah you're right\nWell I think will be the biggest thing we got to do is make sure that we want to stop this we've got to get rid of the country and getting their first those pro Sunni folks back home and then before they get a boy just wants to get to a border that we have to do what we talking about ... it's going to be a myth oh yeah\nIt's going to be made what happened with Israel and Palestine as something similar happening on our border\nBecause this will be forced his hand before the opposite it's Mandeville look horrible so I'm saying I think we need to do with mystical whoever is one of the first of all spread out than those people that you can turn them around somewhere somehow\nYeah well so for those of you for those who don't know tell them where they can find you a on the on your show this oh\nGo ahead you know a a focus ACN Odom cable network will be on with the actual at night um if you don't have a hand or you came with young boys ... dot com that they see that go from here I Do think that what you learn to live without a rough 'cause she\n[laughter] she appreciates\nJob I was living with him at wake up call oh yeah\nRight ... brother eight six six five five one Ninety nine thirty three that's the number to call in and join the conversation listen again you check out Joe you especially need check on Mondays 'cause that's when I'm On there and\nThat's when Joe don't get a pass on the ... because I don't let anybody get it to pass a pass on the debate regardless of who you are what you've done nothing you don't get a pass unless your facts and unless what you have to bear matches the situations you need to check it out Monday charter channel eighty\nAlabama cable network or if you don't have Alabama cable network or charter\nYou can just check it out on WWW dot J\nOur channel eighty Alabama cable network or if you don't have Alabama cable network or charter you can just check it out in WWW dot J.

dog is pretty good actually [laughter] All right let's go down to the phones and we'll talk to her oh hey row how're ya\nHey good morning Michael I'm doing well thank you for taking my call 'em\nHey look I just want to be straight as a American Mexican and I'm truly embarrassed for what is going on right now with this whole caravan\nInvasion um which is being played by the left a doubt ally I'm trying to instill fear of Hispanics here in the U.S\nAbout how might how bad we might be and not letting that man which is a crock um you know as an American this cannot happen and you know as a\nSomeone who came from a parents who fled their own country\nBecause of authoritarian and socialist tendencies now that the Democrats are on last themselves\nAre in many parts um why would the head when we vote\nFor governments system that our parents and grandparents fled from that it's just after nine people need a wake up people need to get to the polls and vote for freedom vote for prosperity\nFor nine people need to wake up people need to get to the polls and vote for freedom vote for prosperity enough of the other crap they've totally and master cells and they are showing\nWho they are and they're obviously desperate for power we all need to wake up Americans\nAre\nFrom different sides wherever in Latin America they came from we do not want it's just a government that is actually trying to gain power um you know my father never took anything from the government will lead and prosperity believe\nAnd self righteousness um we all need to think that because if the Democrats take over the house we're going to see it different it's got to be worse than what it is now um we need to get out and vote I Know went into houses top\nPeople need to hear everyone and say this is not who we want\nAnd we just need to fight for freedom because that's why we're here will live the best country in the whole world maybe some of these guys are the caravan have good intentions maybe they want a better life but it's not the way to do it in in what's happening right now so just to get that off my chest Michael\nRowed hang with me for just a second you know you and I have had been friends for a long time you come up here to the studio where this in the past and you and I have talked to a you know numerous times and I'm curious\nAbout if you can give us some insight as soon as you point out your your your heritage\nI kinda like to know your thoughts about what people that share your heritage that you know personally feel about not just the caravan but just the condition of the country as a whole and let me tell you before you answer that why I'm asking that kind of a question because you mentioned a\nYou know your family I also have a friend of mine that I haven't seen actually seen or just one time recently unfortunately in the funeral\nBut um her name is Maria and you know she and I were very good friends are our daughters play together when they were young you know as people grow up they then they go their separate ways and whatnot\nBut Murray as family is from Cuba and her family fled Cuba during the but teach the years\nBecause of something very similar to what you're speaking of and every every Hispanic slashed Latino and I apologize for that moniker because I'm sure there's a difference between the two but everyone that I've ever met or interacted\nWith has expressed the same sentiment that you just did but it seems that\nThe the the left is portraying it as though the Latino community is so as far left as many of\nThem or is there any is there any truth to that and if so where am I missing it\nYou know that's a really really good question Michael um\nIt really depends where people ended up in this country if people end up in a very urban setting I e Chicago LA New York and even Atlanta now there is a process of adopting a nation\nThat the left goes through\nAnd what they do is they buy you they by the people in need how they promise things to them they promise welfare they promise um anything to be able to say we're going to help you\nBut you have to promise to conform\nAnd you have to conform to the ideology of it\nSay we're going to help you\nYou have to promise to conform and you have to conform to the ideology of the law and people truly Michael\nIn urban settings you're brainwashed all the friends that I had a cargo that live in these urban areas and they hear me speak hold on social media\nThey don't get me because they've never lived outside and they think that's all you have to believe in and\nIf they even think\nOf moving away from that ideology they get attacked um to get back in line and I've seen this one I talked to friends of mine that are there even business type people have to conform\nMindedness and I I had\nReally given that a whole lot of thought that that the viewpoint some other coast\nWithin the circle of light mindedness\nAnd I I had never really given that a whole lot of thought that that the viewpoints of other cultures isn't so much a danger to this country as much as the ... the the extreme extremism\nThat seems so desire is to want to assimilate them into their viewpoints and if they come into this country without a preconceived notion of what this country is outside of freedom and liberty and that kind of stuff\nIf they come here they become more or less a blank canvas is to have a ideology\nInstalled and or instilled in them where they know nothing different does that make any sense\nYes but if you look at it goes back to what we talked about a few weeks ago\nHow\nIn the big cities the urban areas if you will you got people who want to be accepted the parts of groups\nCommunities stuff like that so they started molding their beliefs to that group so they can quote unquote fit and yes people 'cause I mean\nFor all and end all actuality human beings are a pack animal\nWe we got to be around other people and make it takes a special kind of person to be a hermit you know we have to have interaction with other people to stay sane unfortunately a lot of the big groups that like to interact with each other are insane and so they spread it\nAnd so other people adopt those ideas to fit into that group where as you go into the country or the suburbs or whatever you want to call it\nThere you're so far removed from all that\nConstant gathering of the\nThe minds if you will you have come to think for yourself\nWell you know there's been no ah no secret to the fact that I have a background in the construction industry with a special emphasis on foundation repair waterproof in drainage that's how I ended up with a radio program on the station with Dale Johnson roll over ten years ago during a program called house dogs would just do in this nation\nAnd because of that and because of my relationship to that industry and I still have this company besides got Alabama water management and would it drains and some pops and crawl spaces and things like that for houses that are flooding and mold and all that kind of all that kind of stuff\nBut because of that particular company and my relationship to some of the other larger foundation companies from which I've been employed over the years I have been very ah very\nOften exposed to people within the Latino community because they tend to gravitate towards the construction field\nAnd now they're not reflect back on that and the guys the crews that I was working with and that's sometimes I've even hired\nIts now dawning on me that in my experiences with them they didn't necessarily seem to be hyper political they didn't seem to be\nObama fans or Trump fans they were just doing their thing taken care of their family getting a day's work in sometimes long day's work 'cause they're talking about you know a group of people and I know this was going to sound ... perhaps a little bit on the bigoted side but talking about a work ethic\nAt least the ones I've worked with but anyway you know now that I think about it\nThey're not consumed with this unless they are mired right there in the middle of it it's a similar conversation that we've had with locket\nAnd all of a sudden I'm beginning to realize that that the that the real\nDegradation if you will they the the assaults on culture is coming out of the blue zones\nAnd not so much of a sense of right or wrong or ideology because\nWhen people are removed from the urban centers they don't seem to share this this is one of the reason is there's a story up here\nOh gee because when people are removed from the urban centers they don't seem to share this this is one of the reasons there's a story up here\nI I forgot to you know who ... but it popped up earlier\nAbout a Trump rallies and how these Trump rallies which are are for the most part middle America\nHow they're drawing crowds that are massively larger than anything Obama ever attracted even at the height of his popularity let's not even bring Hillary\nEnd of the equation because she couldn't attract anybody I mean everybody was pumped in there and so I'm starting to wonder and and and on top of that if you have all these polling organizations that are located in these urban centers and they are you're not fighting big polling places and Jim is in Alabama\nIf they're only polling people within these blue Specter's if you will\nThan what they're putting out in terms of data could not be less accurate\nAnd you know I'm I'm getting called up the call an email or text message over the last several years and it's not until row made that point that it really kind of hit me that there's no blue wave out there there couldn't be a blue wave and ... and to the degree that there is it would have\nTo be artificial and so you've got all these people\nOn this caravan come into the United states and I think that a lot of folks right and left are seeing this as fresh blood particularly on the left\nAnd an opportunity to indoctrinate these people along the way so that do it when they get here they're automatically in this position of a of you know being antithetical to what we in middle America considered debate the future of this country\nBut it doesn't have to be that way because as reality sets in and you begin to realize that the goodies eventually run out because once you start voting Democrat\nIt's just like in these ah these qualifier horror films where you know the that the alien invaders from outer space they come and they consume everything in their path and then they move on and we're seeing Democrats do that culturally\nOnce they've got you in the envelope of voting for them and as especially if it's generational they move on to the next group somebody with a common in the program it's a couple of days ago maybe it was last week\nThat it seems like the the black community is being left behind as extreme as Democrats move onto the Latino community\nAnd it's a damn shame because it's the height of exploitation\nI'm done [noise] but you know\nI'm very frustrated by it because it is patently unfair\nThe unemployment numbers across the country do you know the unemployment was in Shelby County now arguably Shelby County the richest richest county in the state of Alabama you know the unemployment numbers for Shelby County as of yesterday\nUh who point two percent I was gonna say about three years ago three point one\nTo point two percent among Latinos in blacks it's slightly higher than that but all across the country the unemployment numbers are great\nI don't have a lot of money in the bank I mean I've got some investments but I was checking my um my uh one of my accounts what am I stock accounts yesterday and I have a mutual fund is a devastating fine it's up to ... percent this year\n[noise] and you know I have other friends that are telling me similar things and I'm looking at all these these these denominator Z and unemployment\nAnd you know I have other friends that are telling me similar things and I'm looking at all these these these denominator and unemployment's down my personal income is up slightly because the tax breaks my investments to the extent that I have them all up pretty significantly\nAnd all across the board there are all these positive signs and yet we've had all this and it's been consternation from these people that are screaming at the world's going to hell in a hand basket\nFor the life and ... I Do not understand it but then again if you reach out to a certain aspects of the culture\nWhere educational systems might be challenged or people that do they come here legally or otherwise the don't understand capitalism or the American way of doing things it's very easy to supplant in their minds and entirely different reality\nAnd we're planning a reality in their mind that it's detrimental to their futures and it's a damn shame over right back\nWhen he enters the room ... it's the Michael ... show\nThe following it does not necessarily reflect the opinions or abuse of Crawford Broadcasting its employees affiliates or advertisers mob rule\nThat was on the line and this year's election [noise] this is just as Tom Parker you also how the leftist mobs trying to tear down just says capping off\nThey want me to be next after for Thirteen Years on the Alabama Supreme Court has a strong independent conservative voice I've taken on and beating the Southern Poverty Law Center and been outspoken that ruby weighed in on murder fail were wrongly decided [noise]\nAnd I'm a strong supporter of President Trump and his efforts to put more conservatives on our federal courts to left his mom doesn't like that\nThey want judges who will overturn our laws and look the other way when the leftist mob tries to destroy some side to this is justice Tom Parker\nRepublican for chief justice I'm asking for your vote to keep Alabama's towards the place where the rule of law was respected and not where the mob rule [noise] people were my Tom\nFor chief justice mocks lemonade twenty to Montgomery three six one one one [noise]\nRight up the road molten Alabama you've been hearing me talk about these guys for years and I cannot say enough\nAbout the folks at Billy Mitchell jewelry what an amazing about your folks were so amazing deals are some of the most beautiful diamond jewelry you'll ever see of course you get great deals on those diamond engagement rings and get them and you can certainly upgrade the woman if your dreams rang as well when you go to Billy Mitchell but don't forget it's also a graduation season is upon us\nA whole line of tendons bracelets necklaces you name it if it's a diamond it's that Billy Mitchell jewelry if they don't have it you don't need it check 'em out on Facebook or for more information give him a call", "show_name": "The Guys", "year": "2018", "city": "Birmingham", "day": "23"}
