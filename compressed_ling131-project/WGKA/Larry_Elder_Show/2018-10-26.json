mostly crowding by Pearl earring fifty nine of I ...\nLive from the AM nine twenty the answer a studio within buck head it's fifty one degrees oh\n\nIs this segment we take phone calls so we've got great cause all on the midterm elections we're going to get right\nTo him but I wanted to address the too close Senate races right now uh in the country eleven days after the midterms and we're going to go right to your phone calls those are in Arizona\nAnd Nevada let's start in Arizona than a this is an open seat because of the the passing of Senator John McCain tell us about uh the two candidates they're both both members of Congress\nYes right Martha McSally versus curious and send them a Jordan I I'm I'll be honest with you I think this is going to come down to one issue in the state of ... of Arizona that immigration and border security there's a a very big divergence between the two candidates\nAh Martha ... closely aligned with President Trump on his efforts to secure the border and then work on an overall solution a fierce and send them a just quite\nFrankly is not and I think that has been the driving force of of really having the numbers move Martha ... way a matter of a month ago it looked like a two three four point advantage for cures and send them a a now it looks like Martha ... up by about a point or two\nI'm there early numbers there as far as registration sure do look like they're favoring her about again Jordan go back to globally this is one of the two Republican seats the Democrats absolutely have to have if they were to take majority yeah I mean\nSo again this is these are important races and they are down there within the margin of error either candidate could win a but there's some momentum going behind the Republicans right now or take a listen this is just interesting the Democrat candidate congressman a cinema uh she said this in a radio show this is coming back to haunt her\nThat by thirty three\nNo no I don't buy more me as an individual if I Want to go fight in the Taliban army idols there enough you know I'm I'm fighting for the Taliban after I'm Sorry that's personal decision and I asked\nI mean I don't know why she said something like that find that I don't care if you go fight for the Taliban but as a member of Congress and then she says this about her own state by thirty for speaking to the very liberal this year that routes nation just a couple of months ago\nAs they say and that's very loud and pay a laboratory democracy and then my hair is I'm a math class [laughter]\nLine they read it ... out of high\nYou know that's not funny if you're running for your your or to be a singer in your state where you've got to issue serious stuff like that just to please the crowd I'm so again that is coming back\nUm and I know that those those are by ... being used and said speeches are being used uh to remind people that just to these people are just\nSo many times says the Senate candidates they tried change who they are less finally let's get to the vet and then it gets these phone calls the vet a Dean Heller is Republican incumbent are facing a challenge from a Democrat Rosen a what does it look like they're\nYeah Jacky Rosen a congresswoman or from Nevada again this was one of those ... states the Democrats really focused on early on they thought they had a great job to flip the seeds does senator ... numbers were down a little bit uh Jordan I think President Trump is actually played a big role in this state as well\nOr the turning out for Dean Heller of the numbers have turned around and it looks like he's got about a two point lead there again a lot of national\nDollars are going to flow into the state Jordan I think Dean Heller is in a better position than Jacky Rosen is again it's one it's a state that Democrats have to have if they have the majority so if you're in Nevada you're going to be inundated with ads over these last eleven days\nOkay we've got lots of calls try to keep your comments as short as possible so we can get to all of them let's start with Joe in North Carolina on line one Joe welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nYes I'm a manager in an apartment complex in North Carolina and I've been asking residents you know how are you seeing and how are you voting and\nI've only found two Democrats who say they're still gonna vote Democrat those are the ones who've told me they're Democrats is probably at least Fifteen said after the cabinet thing they just can't vote Democrat\nEither that is an interesting point right there I think that I Want to get as many calls as possible but I think we cannot forget the effect that Kavanaugh a behavior by the Democrats\nReally is what started this Republican beginning of the I I wouldn't say the red wave yet but a comeback for Republicans not just in the Senate especially in the city but also potentially in the house as well which we can get to it later show because there's a lot to talk about there's well focusing on the Senate today\nEleven days out back to the phones we go but I Do think Kavanaugh it was it was the beginning of this Republican kind of resurgence in uh the mid term elections a along with President Trump hitting the campaign trail again are doing what he does best surely in Michigan on line to surely welcome to Jason Kidd alive\nI enjoyed and a couple of minutes go fans said that one state's gonna be the shocker and I think that could be Michigan\nJohn James up against Debbie Stabenow two to three weeks ago he was Fifteen points down he's now seven and in some competitive various things either even or running ahead he is a rock star if you have any listeners and\nAll the ones in Michigan check him I have a website and definitely tell I've had I've convinced several people already just telling us about him that are changing their vote for him so we we need to talk and communicate with our friends and neighbors and make them aware he has a wonderful candidates\nThis was a lot of military experience right then and again was twenty points down just six weeks ago is surging right now in Michigan State that President Trump did carry\nDay and I just want to be answered laughed fence contest promotions and on demand audio all\nOn your summer to North America is free to do with the idea that or Android app store [noise]\n[noise]\n\nAh I said they

learn something he said he held or [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nBack with you again going into Larry Elder pain free release ... dot com studios\nYou mean Shawn you don't like\nKnow [laughter]\nFilling in for Dennis on Monday the year's me say this I'm In trouble\nMore cost effective you against filling in for Larry I've done a lot of this over the years including at our former station and it's always a privilege to keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next at my Web page I like to some music you know he said what does he say I'm from Brooklyn now in LA\nIs because of defines me check my Web page out mark has to show dot com where you can email me\nFollowing me on Facebook or Twitter and Sean wants me to tell you out there why I'm not a Dodger fan and\nIn a second so you can get in touch me mark iceberg at AOL dot com and check on my website and see where it I still in besides hilarity or Dennis like that\nSo the Dodgers and playing Washington I write and I and I always rooted against dogs what do I do that\nI'm originally from Brooklyn and they left me and when people here that they go\nWith you left Brooklyn too\nI was a little kid but they did do that to us All right we're taking your calls at a\nEighty eight nine seven ones the agents for those are just joining us they first hour we were talking about the bombs and the uh the accused and we didn't mention his name that's important so they don't get that kind of publicity if that's what they're seeking\nBut after we did that and said that how outrageous it was an we acknowledge that we got into the idea that the press obviously\nWants to blame President Trump for everything and anything everything is his fault that goes wrong and everything that goes right President Obama as you heard we'd like to take credit we we played a clip of in a minute or two of them in the last hour and it was hard for me to take\nBecause I forgot what he did all the time which is he would set up straw dummies and then tear down like you said in the clip we have that to you know we want to risk babies a wave of that from the arms of immigrants no they're illegal immigrants and we don't want to rip babies away was your policy by the way Mr former president\nYou know we didn't change that policy needs to be changed obviously\nBut it was your policy in the first place\nAnd we don't want to rip babies away in fact the real answer is\nDon't come here in the first place if you're going to come illegally come here legally and there'll be no issue and who knows who setting up this caravan who's paying for all of it how they're getting here I heard all kinds of rumors but the fact is he's got to stop them it's an invasion you can't allow this to happen\nSo we followed by others but again he can't do anything right and of course the things he says\nAre the reasons that the suspect in custody did what he did it's because of President Trump\nBut then we evolved into the point\nThat you know why they hate him so much among other reasons because he's the first Republican that I can remember in years who's standing up to their nonsense who's willing to call it like it is it's reasonable to ask as I mentioned last our weather Hillary should be indicted for what she did she committed crimes\nAnd when I was sympathetic to her eye on another station another network people get annoyed with me because I said if they agreed to leave the scene forever maybe we could agree not to indict Hillary and people said\nShe's not above the law that is a reasonable argument that's what they see lock her up that is not violent but it's just following the rules and principles that we all in this country are subject to the laws of the country what is so radical about that\nYeah but but yet when President Trump says it's absolutely outrageous and what else I Can't even remember what else they pick on him for what was the other issues besides lock her up that they say Trump keeps inciting the audience when I think of it I'll let you know but whatever he says it's ... it's just terrible right on the press because the press a fake press they have a fake press\nThe enemy the people the enemy the people if they're not going to do objective journalism 'cause they have tremendous power\nA ... year is taking the if you American people can't get the news in an object away I never knew when I was growing up with the politics was of the journalists who were reporting it that's not true now third gender so clear he's right to call them out on it\nBut I think this is insanity when when the Obama could be outraged sent in theory the rest of us and say things like you'll keep your doctor and you keep your health care and uh you know we're we're ... we we care about race people on our side and we judge people by the color of their skin don't legal legal\nI've often said give me nine black women on the Supreme Court core conservative and I'm happy camper know where the guy\nSaid always see race and gender and uh you know sexual orientation we don't talk that way we see individuals much more and his dentist and Larry always talk about we see people as people you're the guys that do this kind of stuff\nPart let me know what you think and we'll take your calls at eight eight eight nine seven one stage and I hear I have an article Sean just gave me journalist accused Trump of inciting violence against the press I mean I I I don't even want to review article now because it's too upsetting you guys have created this in the media because you haven't been there\nLet me know what you think well let's go to um I think we're going to Angus is is it angers I don't see the name of al Alan ... there's a town called language dexterity though how You're welcome to the uh welcome to ... to show\nHow are you there okay we'll put out on hold\nAnd [noise] [noise]\nOkay and let's go to George in Hollywood, California Georgia Iran with mark [noise]\nYeah [noise] Well Mark you know as a retired or a mental health professional I just have to say that the a long time media has finally revealed itself and its ... year cites cos\nAnd I'm at this point uh the media and uh this a bomber individual both have some very prominent features of paranoid schizophrenia\nAnd I'd start with these ah [noise]\nA media a nuts are saying oh that Trump is responsible for all of this ah bombers stopping these responsible for the bomb well you know\nThat's not only mind reading but it's thought insertion they believe that Trump has in certain thoughts into the bombers mind for him to go do it\nAnd the bomber of course well uh you know it's spot broadcasting and he's having a conversation with Trump through his television or maybe he looks out a picture of him in the paper and he says oh we're so I get the water or tell me what the hardware store do I get the pike bad or what about this other stuff\nWell the reality is is that individuals are responsible for their own behavior and speech just moves air\nAnd people their motivations belong to them and what they do is their responsibility\nAnd speeches protected for the president just as it is for everybody else and just like we've been talking we didn't blame a Bernie Sanders\nBy the media is going leaving out the fact that thanks to the arms and people were saying and I don't understand why they had to make it even more trouble than it was it seems like oh that guy's it make\nYou know I don't know it it it didn't make things work and I I just don't understand why the truth isn't enough because the truth is that\nLet's see let's hear this have any form of regular encountered a so I just see on any property\nAnd there will be appointed\nBonded currently said at five million dollars [noise]\nWe have just as of the few hours ago determines in in a established some of the suspects movements and actions just prior to the shooting\nThe we received a tip that the suspect was seen outside of the local church where a he appeared to on video has been attempting to gain access into the church uh their video surveillance system called that\nUh he was unsuccessful in gaining access to the church\n[noise] well that that's a very sad story and uh\nWe'll ... we'll follow it a little bit more but does say Kroger shooting suspect tried to enter a black church before killing to look very crazies out there there is there no none of us are denying that what we have a problem with is it for a whole group of people are accused of that like you know Republicans are evil and we're ... and ...\nThat's the problem we there we know there are nuts like the the guys up the pipe bombs we understand that but we all don't get guilty of that because of that we we don't take responsibility for the\nPerson who Trump hasn't done anything outraged look he's not a perfect package\nHe doesn't always say what I wanted to say but he's standing up to the other side which hasn't happened before and that's why you have the reporters are filling out that the the document with two hundred people signed onto they can't make it because they're holier than thou and by the way they're on the left they're always on the left\nBreaking ADS news just recently the U.S department of education announced that acting\nOn a complaint filed by alliance defending freedom against
