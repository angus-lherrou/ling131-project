A. G.

thousand people Van Jones CNN\nI think it's much more likely that Donald Trump is paying for this and ... can be paying for this exactly the worst kind of thing they'd be happening or in a moment like this because what it does is it gives a mother talking points Donald Trump look at these invading horde that I Do want to say one thing\nWhich is just because someone is Middle Eastern of course there are no Middle Eastern people there but that doesn't mean that they're added doesn't mean that there are terrorists how do you know that we were in this world now where Trump can say Middle Eastern and everybody then immediately somehow began to think of terrorists\nOf most of the terrorists that we are just as we've had the United states are not being committed by Middle Eastern people by Muslims\nThey're being committed by right wing extremists in our own country but I just didn't lie on top of lie on top of lie wrapped up and live and then with life on top of it\nSo we should just let fourteen thousand people come here to talk and if fourteen thousand more want to come back and come to\nThis is outrageous\nWhat country were put up with this\nWith Mexico\nPut up with a caravan of fourteen thousand what am I was trying to get into their country are you kidding me\n\n[noise] now according to the Washington Post\nQuote for now Mexican police have merely stepped aside as a caravan his past watching first as Margaret took ... across the river to separate the country from Guatemala and then it continued by foot along the main highway chanting thief a poodle or yes we did it\n[noise]\nThe Washington Post continues the response appears to have that respond to appear to have been conveyed to the White House and now once again Mexico's most important bilateral relationship appears to be on shaky ground no kidding [noise]\nTrump tweeted sadly it looked like Mexico's police and military or aren't able to stop the caravan heading to the southern border of the United states\nLater on he said on Fox News I don't know what's going on with Mexico it looks like people are walking right through the middle of Mexico I'm not exactly thrilled they're either end of\nQuote [noise]\nThe government said they were going to do something about it but according to the Washington Post ... riot police have stopped posed for pictures in their gear as is ready to combat the migrants letting international TV crews film them before retreating\nAnd letting the caravan pass through undeterred\nTrump\nRefer to himself as a nationalist and today in the in the oval office he clarified\n\nOf al\n...\nLove our country and our country has taken says second federal if you look at the trade deals and nobody knows are better than me [noise] I'm knocking down some of the worst deals I've ever seen when giving all of our wealth all of our money to other countries and then they don't treat us properly\nWhere we're protecting other rich countries very very rich countries including by the way a country that happens to be very much that it was Saudi Arabia\nImmensely wealthy and we're taking care of the military for a fraction of the fall is not fair to us other countries also immensely wealthy countries and\nWe have to get reimbursed for that we should not be the world's police keeper and not get reimbursed and by the way when I bring up to the heads of countries like Japan prime minister I'll be a friend of mine I bring it up he looks at me\nAnd he goes I understand they understand that nobody has ever asked them for what have you ever asked I said have you ever been asked like you have to be kept out [noise] nobody's ever asked so that's a pretty unfair thing I'll I'll get back to you again factors wait wait wait wait\nPresident said all I Want is for our country to be treated with respect that's what he means he says national is do we know he's a white nationalist that's a bone thrown to the races except\nMaybe it's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most them if they think they're racist\nBefore a couple of seconds I should have a pretty good report very says yes I was just fall under\n... that would really be\nThere is a concern that you're sitting recorded message a dog whistle out there there is concern passive voice you mean that's what you think he's doing is you're like\nI never even heard that I cannot imagine that you mean I I'm a naturalist I never heard that theory about being a nationalist I've heard them all but I'm somebody that loves our country when I say a national as I don't like it when\nGermany Spain one percent of GDP report of course that Jim Acosta for NATO and we're paying for point three percent I don't like that that's not fair I don't like it was as an example where protecting\nHero and we're paying for almost the entire cost of the day that we're paying for a very very substantial portion far greater than what it should be a we have great respect for those guys but on top of that\nI don't like it when they put up barriers to our farmers were farmers cannot sell it to Europe they have trade barriers that make you guys know is better than anybody than trade barriers that are as severe as China's trade barriers which really coming down they want to make a deal very badly they'll be coming down [noise]\nBut I Am very proud of our country and we cannot continue to allow what's happened to our country to continue to have one can't let it happen so I'm proud proud of our country that I Am a nationalist is a word that hasn't been used too much some\nPeople use it but I'm very proud I think it should be brought back I'm somebody that wants to help other countries of the world\nBut I also have to take it when to take care of our country\nWe cannot continue to allow ourselves to be duped or the military and also do to address with the European Union as an example last year on trade with last one hundred and fifty one million dollars on top of that we lost hundreds of billions of dollars\nOn protection and so we protect\nAnd we ... we we do the training and they get you can't do it I Want to be fair so want them to open their borders I Want them to make it fair for our farmers are our companies are medical companies sell medical equipment they just put restrictions on\nYear and a half ago with a medical equipment can't get into Europe even though it's better than what they have [noise]\nSo they have to treat as well all I Want our country is to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years other countries that are allies of ours so ... they have not treated our country fairly\nSo in that sense I Am absolutely a nationalist that I'm proud of it yes do you ever use that um this\nLast night in Texas [laughter] as the Trump referred to Maxine Waters today\nWhat criminal aliens in American citizens which is a Democrat must be voted out of office we need [noise]\n\nPeople on the show\nMaxine Waters that Soviet

wondering I'm In the door to a National Guard down here I Know it's not an or no way to put up a temporary structure I was wondering if we knew some of the military can we just try it out or get some\nCoordination with Mexico and set up some things ... water where we could provide food shelter clothing this out and the other so that people that do have like a immediate need need this kind of things a little bit of water\nMedical supplies can get taken care of and pulled out of that ... that kind of broken up lord\nWell it depends on how far the care of it gets I think a Joseph ... I'll go to Harry first go round I think this was bought for everybody to answer very briefly if the care of it gets that close to us border yes there will likely be some kind of supplies set up at the U.S wants to start process process see\nOr some of the people are but the idea is that it will not get\nA be allowed to where she was ... get to that point\nI think you're absolutely right so our objective\nShould be to stem the flow of the caravan while they're still in Mexico or in Central America that's number one and then number two we should have stepped in mine or should they moved further and closer to the American border as why not\nTime right now to get Eddie ... comments on let me just say this there's also thousands of humanitarian groups the U.S and Mexico could work with to provide the humanitarian need\nSo that it does it become a direct country it's it's ... like if I reach the U.S border they're going to take care of me that becomes ... so I think it's best for the nonprofit world\nWho should rush to these kind of a situation regardless of the politics of player the immigration politics to play and if people need help those who are in need and we could\nThese countries can facilitate that as well we will come right back mug Jason kill alive\n\nBut I Want to answer [noise]\nNurse or afternoon traffic at stake when the only major problem ... removing by fire from me ... boulevard\nBridge are trying to get that off the red light unfortunately life Kathleen worsening bearing signing the perimeter use that for highly don't even think they didn't print knock the whole plane\nAnd then I sat down Cobb County down running I mean I found found me asked me to read them down the road many fine had sat down with ... hair involving in their own unique went down by spending ...

Y. P. D. and all these other agencies are here to protect you\nIt's important to note that this is ongoing investigation as we have more information we will provide\nI emphasize there is no specific threat\nThere you go it appears that it was very targeted towards maybe CNN\nOr the Clintons a a George Soros the Obamas in Washington potentially Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a Florida State office as well uh safely none of these devices exploded no one has been injured\nA security measures that have been put in place a bit of work so far we prayed that they continue to do so and let me just say if it's the final time we address it on the air today or we can ... the fullest extent this kind of activity especially it appears ... somehow motivated just by putting these leaks together\nIdeologically there's no place for that the United states we can have vigorous discourse we do not do this to each other and whoever\nOr if it's a group of people who is behind this should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law be put behind bars for very serious violations of crime in the United states uh back to the phones we go we're talking about this issue with the caravan\nOnly Thirteen Days out for the midterm elections you cannot\nAgain you just can't uh uh uh try to say that we're you know tried to divide a guess divorce the issue of the midterm elections\nAnd this care of an issue and the immigration issue it's all coming to a head at the same time by the way it would be see those reporting so suspicious package was also intercepted it was addressed the former attorney general holder this is unacceptable folks uh\nDon't care what kind of politics you have\nThis is unacceptable as an organization that also has received these kinds of packages before I'm a ... it's it's always out acceptable regardless of what side of the ... at all it's criminal you should be prosecuted a and a and again thanks to our law enforcement officials\nAnd those officials who who intercepts these packages\nOr before they make it a a two or their tended targets a it take for that so far has been what has happened today let's talk about the care of and a lot of calls coming about that let's go to Chris said California lied for Cruz to welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nAnd well thank you for taking my call I my comment is I I don't see any thing but that never came being sent to the border and I think they should be my question is Iraq can they help out\nA state governors participating and you know president meeting their support what can anything Jerry Brown do here in California to keep my sympathy at writing these people come across that border [noise]\nI think needs to stay out of the way maybe let his as state guard\nAssisted the national guard\nOr any other U.S forces of border patrol\nThat were necessary a set of voting politics a dominate his decision making unfortunately I think there are two days out from mid term elections a at a very liberal a governor is likely not going to to make those decisions so I think you'd best he could stay out of the way\nLet a local law enforcement there in California do the right thing where she would the federal government or who is there to provide the main support when it comes to our border it's the federal government uh that that are defending our border and also deals with situations at the border but but yeah I could I I\nSee we're going with it is and what could California's governor do\nAnd some of the state government officials there who are very liberal do to try and help a ... and it even encourage these kind of care of ads in the future and I think that's a serious problem\nLet me go to a ... you know that they are to say I've been an anti first the idea that politicians we looked up the group behind this they're based in Oakland, California does surprise there\nAnd it's a village Without Borders is what it translates to take your donation they organized these caravans right out of California\nRight uh yeah I agree with what you said your and the governor of California needs to stay out of this right now he is\nA very left leaning political a person in the in the country is\nOf and behind the California sanctuary stayed ideas sanctuary cities that everybody come in open borders no restrictions whatsoever on immigration come on come all that is not the attitude of the administration or should it be\nA and I think that the best thing for a brown and and those who support his position is to stay out of this and allow\nThe president the United states who is really the chief protector of the borders of the United states the executive branch of government or do what it has to do right now in the face of this tidal wave of humanity that's coming in\nAm not the answer John cue Twain\nAsked radio I'm ...\n\n\nI I I understand\nAre lots of all the all the\nYou know what to do one of those that don't just don't just [noise]\nYou who

central I see a ton of people on hold I'll give you as quickly as I can at eight eight eight nine seven one stage that Tripoli nine seven one seven to for three but I Want to have a conversation now\nA with a good friend who has a new book out and uh who is pulling no punches he does not pull punches in his writings you does not pull punches when he writes columns for\nA town hall ... he's a senior columnist there and he does not pull punches in interviews he also does not pull punches on Twitter and he had a lot to say which made me sick Kurt slicker author of military\nNormal regular Americans over ...\nOur democracy on the on the\nHe said let's do this thing to have you back my man how are you [noise]\nHey great to be here\nMan I there's so much ground to cover I Would like to do the pleasant trees and everything else I Want to talk about your book but I Want to talk about all of these issues going on Tucson diving right in do you buy\nThe right wing pipe bomb conspiracy or with all of these things being center Soros Obama's Clinton's and CNN because China weeks two weeks before the election Kurt I Do not buy it for one second I smell false flags being planted go ahead\nI think it is more likely than not not a right wing conservative outlier viewing this look a it is one of three things at the right wing conservative outlier\nIt is a nut who was a political and just wacky or it is a someone uh allied with a lap attempting to do exactly what's happening now which is a conservative suburb violent Bob guys [noise] um\nIf you look at the evidence but we are constantly told how a random shooters are going to turn out to be you know and are a Christian ... can I may never ... never we know\nThat a Democrats have been urging violence and a ... attack ... we know that the law has a history of bombings just look at the Nineteen sixties and seventies eighties indisputable\nOr that they did it all it's also indisputable that we did see a nearly\nEndless series of hoaxes mostly hate crime hoaxes on campuses handle where someone did something horrible you know I guess swastika or new or something and it turned out to be the very same a social justice warrior victims are trying to create a pressure\nI don't know the answer you don't know the answer but I Will tell you this I Am not going to allow the leap to tell me that I Can't look at the facts and fake this is a viable possibility I were to blame Donald Trump and sixty three decent Americans\nWho are built this country feed it you'll end up ...\nA a face on the the the the the sketchy narrative that he's left us requests eighties we might occur if we don't want to\nHurt the president came out just or to today rather and did what a president should do so did the vice president and by the way and they called for an end to this they called for civility they called for\nA no more violence he said very clearly quote in these times we have to unify we have to come together in some one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political science of any guide\nHave no place in the United states of America\nWhat happened was absolutely true that was of course it's true but but but hold on this is what I wasn't really react to\nThe response to that from Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and house minority minority leader Nancy Pelosi was to rip President Trump suggesting that he didn't mean it saying quote from President Trump's words ring hollow\nUntil we were versus his statements that condone acts of violence they will this in a statement perks the party that actually has Maxine Waters and Cory Booker and Hillary Clinton\nAnd countless others out they're calling for acts of violence and instability in the public forum they're the ones saying that it's Trump and the Republicans who are responsible for violence going\nOoh look they are ... are they are blind and stupid because they missed the ... thank God if only someone wrote a book called militant normal available on Amazon about this very subject they think we're stupid\nThey think we're stupid because Democrats are used to dealing with stupid people that he has the rank and file Democrats [noise]\nIt's not going to work this is going to have the same effect as they thought Kevin always a great idea let's track this guy and he drink beer and you know had fun in high school ... and\nThe ... that destroyed their blue wave this\nIs another example of a situation that they laid it like sensible adults could only benefit them political but they will not do it they will apply to bigotry and prejudices against normal Americans and try and paid ... ... marriage as\nSome sort of a set of violence psychopaths\nAnd normal Americans are going to say that's just not true you know whoever did this clearly need to go jail weather as a rightwing outlier a yacht well maybe you need to go that not house or a leftist trying to disrupt um\nAnd there is not a single conservative out there who condones this violence there is not one\nWell that that's that's a big part of this because\nThe the moment even when Nancy Pelosi got shouted down by a bunch of people calling her communist just a few days ago kind of echoing and Mary ... there's been done to Ted Cruz and and and Mitch McConnell and only child and it's a serious Sanders and so in the summer of\nImmediately conservative condemn condemn condemn cannot you can't do that stop that nonsense we don't like it when it's on to us do not do it to them this is bull crap we're better than that\nNow this uh these these ... you know explosive devices potentially we don't even know by the way right now what they are or or where they came for all we do know immediately we condemn condemn can them give them\nWhen the left is doing all of these things part over and over and over again when these leftist mobs and cheaper it so it cetera et cetera are carrying out these acts I'm Still waiting for the first word of hey don't do that from anybody in a in a position of authority and the American last month\nWhen you won't you won't see because they're not against it there for it\nThey're they're there for ... that that's the difference in the normal people that\nThey've got about had about ... six eight hours of this\nWhere where they could have taken the high road and maybe maybe scored some political point that's a political season ... or ... points but once again have overplay their hand\nBecause they hate us normal people so much\nThey don't even bother to try and understand where we may be coming from so that they might be able to craft a message that appeals to watch instead they say you know Trump's encouraging violence and they look at Trump and he's not encourage violent and they look at themselves and they're not racist sexes hate filled and they don't like buying less\nUh and they didn't like it when as normal Americans do they went overseas and defended their country\nThey are immediately to say this is more democratic below me\nAnd you know they are not going to discount the possibility this is from a too clever by ...\nCrying by sending you know bombs that apparently don't work very well and uh uh to people who ... who they know we're going to screen them and catch up and you know that ... that is entirely off\nAnd teaches he can't do that because liberal leaders them in a secular religion\nThey can't look at themselves and say this been a hearty Awlaki is wrong these prejudices are bad we need to change each day it's all based on or a moral superiority and they can't question that and they won't and that's why they're going to lose two weeks from now\nOr just like there is my guest the author of militants normal she's the senior columnist town hall dot Tommy is also an attorney and Los Angeles California uh occurred I Want to hit the nationalism part of the story as well just or choose me two nights ago in Houston, Texas\nA stumping for Ted Cruz in his race against it or ... percent of a president said\nThis that we're you know what I Am I'm a nationalist\nImmediately you heard of Jim Acosta jumped up and said wait a minute what did what did what job that's not just the cost of this is\nSupposed to just to follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there is a concern that you are sending coded language for a dog whistle to some Americans out there is that what you really mean is that you're a white national I don't know how you\nGet white nationalist out of left but what I mean honestly it's like he's playing the Google auto fill he started to type in the word Lazarus do you mean white nationalist and the left is going crazy ever since occurred make long bloody\nI first of all I Love it when Democrats take sides\nAgainst American to say I love America more than other country and you read to hold that position going into the electorate don't let me stop you go right ahead you won't be in that prior\nAnd ask for that you're really mean white nationalist that there is a concern to go to white nationalist okay that's not true there is no concern Mimi among really stupid people but the concern comes from liars\nOkay so you are either an idiot or you or a liar or maybe boat\nYou but we ... if you're starting there there's no other option because it's demonstrably Paul and one
