A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com and a lot of you've done that\nAnd you'll find out on my website and all these other sites where I Will be appearing next besides filling in for learning or dentists or whatever I Do other stuff to\nLast hour talked about the effort of the left to blame these would be bombings on President Trump because of the left and the media and the Democrats hate him in this segment I Want to talk about what a great job in the ... a ... at the\nEnd of the other our asked me to do that what is it done that's so good I think he didn't think there was anything but I Want\nTo talk about what a great job President Trump has done during his time in office\nI said for months now that I care less about what he says and much more in what he does\nHis tweets are not always helped him and he's in my opinion is answer many people you shouldn't\nAnd engaged with people beneath his position to his detriment I I play tennis a lot and uh when uh sometimes on the court people kind of know who I Am and they try to get my vote I just don't answer them off and I say am I getting paid for this getting paid I'm not answering you cut\nMoney talks and you know get some debates with people who shouldn't\nBut I never expected him to govern in such a conservative way he's far surpass my expectations for him I must admit he was not my first choice in the primary season I was actually a Ted Cruz delicate in my initial judgment I thought Trump was only better than John basic\nWhich isn't saying much 'cause junkie supplies will be a Democrat\nBut I have long since admitted that far from being the worst choice or the second worst choice for president he may have very well been the only Republican that could have one in fact I've wondered out loud and the caller suggests this last hour if president Providence was involved in this election\nAfter all a bomb had done you know talking about radically changing our country it might have very well been too late to turn America back of Hillary had one and I don't know if you know Bruce ... he ran against Barbara Boxer the but when she ran for the U.S Senate\nI asked if he thought God was involved in the founding of our country and the answer of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost everything right\nAnd what is it also Providence I Wonder though we got George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most you'd get no argument from me about gods involvement\nAnd now I think we got Donald J Trump with all of his personal shortcomings when the country needed him most yesterday one and I was a strong supporter of his during the general election\nOf course that doesn't matter much either considering we try again and I remember many of us thought he would be very satisfy we would be very satisfied if President Trump will just nominate conservative judges especially for the Supreme Court\nSo I thought were way ahead of the game when he points to Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court\nBut he didn't stop there\nLet me go through the list that the caller wanted ending the Obamacare mandate opening up the Keystone Pipeline than Anwar reserves and in countless regulations hurting the economy\nA significant tax cut I don't know why he talks about it but not enough Republicans do lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax forms moving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords was drawing from the disastrous Iranian deal\nMeeting with Kim all young to possibly produce the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula getting American remains he's already done that returned from North Korea\nMaking sure our borders means something yet color from last hour who knows what people are up to there just isn't it a coincidence that the coming right around the election and who who knows how they're getting paid how they're supporting themselves yeah I've heard local church groups and so on\nBut this isn't just organized spontaneously\nAnd of course naming now for the second Supreme Court a choice a few weeks ago and he was successful another I'm Brett Kavanaugh the list goes on and on and the American people love that he is not politically correct the American people are tired of all those politicians who Spain and Spain and spin\nThat's where we are talking about last hour\nAnd are afraid to say what they are really thinking you don't have\nProblem you can never say that about President Trump he may say too much but he never says two little\nHe is one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime he has done a great job and most of the American people get but it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or the comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left this the Democrats and liberal listeners\nSo maybe it was for this if the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected\nHe's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever you are dreaming if you think he's going to be defeated you a failed to get rid of him but not for lack of trying you started the day he won\nActually we now know that they started the resistance against him against the much before election day but was election day came they couldn't believe that this so called bumbling fools had won\nSo bumbling but he's still one no matter what the upper lead of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed he won and I was almost I mentioned this last hour in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania\nWhich always seemed like a Republicans fool's gold now we're always going to win a Romney who's gonna win ... W is going to win it but not only did he win but there despite their best efforts he want\nHe still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the Muller persecution\nOr is that prosecution got to think about that what was that which one is that no matter the hostile media no matter the never Trump hers no matter all the elites in the swamp President Trump is still here which never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy and including getting a special prosecutor point to\nAnd including the best efforts in terms of the bomber it won't work even though they want to accuse him of being responsible for the bomber he's accused of everything and anything they can come up with he still hear\nIt never should have happened with the ... investigation of profit Jeff Sessions as an aside I'm disappointed you never themself he played into the Democrats hands\nBut typically politicians talk to our adversaries re did she talk the Russians remember the reset button remember Obama saying that he was reelected that he would take care of it and you know they work work it out and he promised that off Mike so all of this\nYou know I'm disappointed in sessions disappointed is lack of oversight should fire Rosenstein\nBut the fact is President Trump has defeated all of this and as we said last hour\nThe press can handle it they can accept that this guy talks back then he says well we've been thinking all these years\nBut that was not to to keep people from coming in that was from TB people from leaving\nWants to work in the short run\nAnd it's important it's not the only thing we need to do as you say but it's one of the resources we need to have taken place just think with the caravan\nI don't even know some callers said what are we going to do right excuse\nMe can I Am tired and I had a caravan what mayor and the data yeah yeah that can that invasion that's right that language they got a family and I can only dated a millionaire kind yep you're right it's not a caravan as not a cat\nAnd added clip plant and people are suffering because of the ... the money\nThat go there whether that is the money and destroy comp they come back to this country you don't know who's going to get murder who's going to get chopped up we're going to get killed what happens is going to get breaking into people wake up you have I have an alarming minor everybody has a warrant to everybody has entered all these politicians\nAccent yeah why have alarmed for you\nThen in the Hollywood at least consult campaigner mentioned there we protect our country\nExactly exactly I I was going to talk about illegal immigration I'll probably saving some money on Monday when I launched a dentist but you're absolutely right we would never let anybody with no documents come into our house and say you were undocumented right to that would be legal we'd never let anybody go to a bank account and said in the bank I just don't have the right documents but give me the money\nGive me marks money no one would ever allow that which you allow people to look at Maxine\nWaters he's got four hundred million dollar home she got she got alarm she's got everything after a short open borders kind of guy that he got could they have taken\nI ...

break up with your phone we all need the help phone break up dot com you're going to find some fascinating stuff on her sight not only about the book and how you can invite someone else\nTo break up with their phone 'cause we all know that other person writes not us it's those other guys and gals pitched those other folks in the family or whatever and some great resources\nAnd among other things a challenge I've noticed encountered on your site you can sign up for thirty day phone breakup challenge tell me about this challenge\nShores so I mean the structure of the book itself is that the first time is meant to regret with science and then the second half as a thirty day plan to help you change\nYour behavior recon us out and let leaving us You're you're freaking out and helping us\nExactly at all the books I read on the subject at the former but not a ladder and I just left feeling depressed and kind of like ... but I don't want to do that I Want to help people so that's why the book it's a thirty day plan\nBut then I thought I don't want people to just have the book and read it like I Do self help books on top of the ... not actually do it I Want to create something that will support them so I put together a theory that thirty thirty days worth of emails\nThat we can accompany you as you go through your break up with your phone and that's available on the website so basically you just sign up and then whenever you sign up that's when the emails start no encourage people to do that\nAnd it also it's a lot more fun to do if you've got friends and family because I've found personally at least ... that that you really great conversation starter and in many cases people are actually grateful that you brought it up because I think everyone is starting to recognize that something that's weird about our relationship or phones I mean just look around you the next time you go outside oh so I found it to be really nice\nI mean I I actually as part of that challenge I have these surveys like questionnaires people can take\nTo a state what they love about their county where they don't love basically keep themselves on track and it's been very interesting for me to see the commonality that the response of the people and and I really can say well first of all Facebook you should be worried because\nWhen I ask what ... what the most problematic at Facebook um but that can everyone struggling with the same thing so I think we should start talking about it\nThat's a good point and it might very well be that your book how to break up with your phone cause them to lose or what was it a hundred and sixty billion dollars a week or so ago was entirely ... title and to do is you know ... ... you're on the back for that tell her because you you made us aware\nOr in in a rather unique wake up one of my favorite chapters of your book is is why social media socks and it's exactly the kind of\nThing we've been talking about it they lure us in and it is about unfortunately about ... oh I Wonder if so and so to solve this hey did you see my post while you didn't like it [laughter]\nAnd that right right I think it's something you don't get a like an instrument but something happened at all at the pollen in the forest you need to be like well yes it did happen and you probably enjoy that more if you wear a coat in it\nI mean but I find I find that to be very hypocritical of the social media companies to talk about how they're supposedly all about in helping to engage in torture actions quote unquote when in reality they're really just trying to get us to spend more time on them I mean and I like to point out to people one of the things I found the most fascinating the similarities between a social media advocates you know they know casinos don't have clock\nThey don't have windows and that so that you lose track of time and if you notice the and look at the social media feeds away their design they're very much deliberately designed to make us lose track of how much time we're spending on them so they will make more money off showing that\nNever thought about it that way but you are absolutely correct one thing that you said which uh which kind of caught me you talk about the challenge and then you'll send an email was helping us out and so forth will jump sarcastic but I've got to pick up my phone to get your email\nCheck it on your desktop and\nPeople are like oh isn't that ironic because I recommend offered like say like ap blockers and time tractors and things for the phone isn't it ironic to use technology to protect ourselves from technology and it was well no it's actually you're dealing with the\n... you know you're dealing with it you were saying that addictive device and you need to have you're trying to use it while you're still being addicted to it so\nIt makes a lot of sense to me to use the tools that are available I within that device to help you get better at putting it down to me I think it's just really um you know you have to recognize and appreciate tool\nOh for sure and and use them wisely and when as you said before we're not saying don't ever be on Instagram and Facebook and tweet and so forth they of course you want to do those things have you been doing them and if you care I Do have some friends or even as the host of the tech showed that say oh I don't do any of that I don't tweet I'm not on Facebook or\nInstagram what the heck is that whenever wow you know it's twenty Eighteen you do know that right [laughter]\nBut but it's All right right some people don't have that issue because they just don't care about the social media stuff then and it's like you\nKnow yeah it was in the you can also you can use social media that getting sucked into it you can say like I don't care deeply about like that no that for your business is important to posts new information or to\nUse it as a tool so again it's not all are that bad or good but you need to be aware of how you are being manipulated unit and then make sure that you have a clear purpose for what you're doing you know you kind of\nTraining with transparency it's like knowing what what

fifty eight million homes and businesses in the U.S\nExceeding the reach of all other providers\nOf course because they're getting to be more and more of a monopoly every day so they have quite the monopoly in most areas as it is the high speed Internet segment represents a major part of Comcast ... revenue and profits which is critical because the Comcast video service subscribers\nCable TV basically continues to decline dramatically\nMore and more people cutting the cable TV cord and going with everything else that's out there whether it be Netflix or Hulu are all the other goodies they're just cutting cable TV and and satellite t._v. for that matter\nAnd they have to count on their high speed Internet which is not staying up most of the time that was our experience\nYou know and I'd like to make an open come into all of the Internet providers how about ... spent less time worrying about trying to have the fastest connection and worry about getting the most reliable connection yeah exactly because I mean I I I actually don't read my Internet I pay for for twenty five megabits Internet at home non catlike cast was for me\nIs enough because if you if you know unless you're streaming on several TVs at once you don't really need more than five or ten\nYou know megabytes and now that you're a bachelor's pretty much you and then when you have came on a weekend maybe he's watching something on another TV but that's still plenty right so you're instead of trying to have the fastest Internet around trying to have the most reliable Internet or on I'm waiting for one provider that'll actually be solid I mean we've had I think the best look here with a TNT him\nEither right you know I'd rather not say that because not a sponsors I'd rather spend some money from these things\nEven them they they they were paying for a gig of it\nWe typically get three or four hundred ... which is again ... okay and a lot better than most people so we're not you know pushing our luck there but we're paying for a gig while it's up to uh get yeah yeah up to whatever\nThe fact is it's just not as reliable in terms of you know bragging about speed great I'd rather they just give us four or five hundred Meg period and it's always there I\nI Want to hear from people in the what the MSC liable and fastest said because I have a house full of teenagers from time to play very a big video games are so little and watching you can also myself trying to watch TV and now I Need fast and reliable so yawning around people that he\nIs and what are you using now is a cable company out in your rural Naples area\nEd Link action with us I don't even know what they do local phone company I so okay so it's sort of the phone company ... have you done a speed test recently have that you shouldn't do I do actually what everybody's on something you're not going to get very fast\nNow wearing her mom read that the Internet plays\nYeah and that'll work only for another few minutes and then it gets bogged down again but everybody can relate to that especially if you have a lot of folks in your household are a lot of people that work and you're just all getting bogged down with the weather over bandwidth you have but I Do agree with Chris\nForget touting your speeds just say we'll reliably deliver not the fastest but the most reliable we guarantee that it'll be up most of the time unless a construction and so their their cars down the street or something beyond our our help\nBut then we'll fix it as quick as we can you know something like that
