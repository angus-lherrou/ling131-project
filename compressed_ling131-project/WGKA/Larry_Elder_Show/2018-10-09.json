I think the realistic outcome looking at what how the judge is handled the case would be and hopefully would beat that they would equate her day would overturn her conviction\nUp but again at the same time they have to keep in mind the the security situation\nAnd it has to be a sort of under the radar or or\nNot read publicizing what they're doing a and and I think that's what the court has kind of a done in this case by not giving the verdict today and just quietly releasing the judgment or at at a later time so all those actions kind of support\nWe can ascertain that that that's what the court is kind of aiming for\nIs what you're ... well the thing ... analysis is absolutely correct\nI think the Pakistani government the justice system of the entire country has to take a decision who decision is will they remain a rule of law country or will they allow mob rules to rain\nAnd if they go down the ladder road this will simply empower both feel crafts this will empower mob rule\nAnd this will increase the level of subordinate should of course just so I Hope uh be taxed on the Justice Department stands up for the rule of law and for the presumption of innocence at the end of the day\nAny impartial observers looking at the evidence will find that there is indeed no evidence in support of this conviction so I Hope the justices will do the right thing and they will find a Bebe\nIn you know you're looking at the trial transcript belief the aspects that have been reporting the press gives an indication that the judges think that this would what we call put up charges the witnesses aren't there that\nWere the ones that were the accusing witnesses the mom who wrote the accusation out does not show up in court so the judges post question both the legal foundation of this as well as the facts will be evidence ... at the same time as they said we took this to the United nations and will continue to do\nUntil she's release and frankly ban the reason we're having this hearing would be any attention at all is because of what's going on international here let's be realistic I might not\nDrawing\nA sub go home to\nRelate nine seven one S.

about our country because there and I'm a minister I knew how often just have to say you're a\nBetter country because Jerry ... in a bunker and the administration wow and Nikki Haley is one of the probably the cabinet member who is the most respected although uh the United nations ambassador is not typically a cabinet level position but of the top\nOfficials and the Trump Administration to

leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure\nThat everything is in good flakes and for the next ... to come in but it's a great day in the United states and I'm proud to then part of the team now I don't have\nAnything he sat on where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was that we've got an hour or six years and we dealt with a hurricane a thousand year ... sitting us well hitting there was a lot and then to come in\nAnd just getting years of Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in her mind that I think you have to be selling was enough to know when you start with Bob and someone else to do the job so they can never find it in a lifetime\nAnd I will say this um if are all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can promise you what are we doing his campaign for that point so I look forward to supporting the front of the action is I\nWanted to do this because Nikki Haley ambassador to the United nations has been very special to me she's an incredible job [noise] she's a fantastic person very important blame but you also is somebody that gets it and she has been [noise]\nAt the United nations from the beginning with us from the beginning and work with us so they get paid has been really long time very intense and she told me probably six months ago she said you know [noise] maybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period for the end of the year\nI Want to take a little time off for a little but she's been a very successful you know governor of South Carolina [noise] for years\nAnd then she uh she did this and this is possibly the more in tune with what's going on in the world very dangerous in lots of things [noise]\nBut she has a job and we've done a fantastic job together we solve a lot of problems or one of the process of selling a lot of problems at the beginning of\nNorth Korea was a massive problem and now we're moving along along\nReally nicely I can speak for secretary of state Mike Pompeo is things in the world of nicotine and the and so we're all we're all happy for you and one way for we have to lose your health we'll come back at some point it\nWas just as it may be a different capacity to that effect\nBut uh I just want to let you know so at the end of the year next year will be leaving and they will be in constant touch I Know that one of the other day or there's you're going to go all the players\nAnd that was really the thing I think she did vested United Nations you got to know the players she got to know China Russia the she knows every one of the very first day basis and they like it\nOr maybe a couple of more likely but they say do they really like another thing maybe more importantly there is a factor [laughter] so the gear just wanted to tell you that we will miss you will be speaking all the time but we will miss you nevertheless so you've got a job but I Want to thank you very much\nNow are competing friends in the media really really really wanted her to leave\nAnd a half to suggest that she was not happy with a boss like Donald Trump instead she thanked him she was grateful\nShe said she intends to campaign for him and twenty twenty no intention to run against him and twenty twenty to primary\nSpoke respectfully isn't interesting how people leave the Trump Administration this prevalent chaotic administration in states such nice things about it\nHas for why I Believe she leaving her that she just burned out I think it's a difficult job and the difficulty boss he's demanding he puts a lot of stuff in the end bucks and I think a lot of people can't keep up the man sleep four or five hours a night\nHe's frenetic he wants to accomplish a lot and I think for people to have to do the stuff he wants to do with a lot of work a lot of pressure\nProbably two years under this president is like four years on any other president people come and people go there's a story about the new rock knew the legendary coach of Notre Dame\nAnd he was ill one and he had an assistant coach the game in insistent won and won pretty handily and new rock and he had admitted to one of the seniors at the college that it bothers him that the this assistant won the game and his dad\nAnd the man said well we are all useful but none of us is necessary\nAnd that includes the president United States\nThe sun is going to rise in the eastern set in the west irrespective of what happens we keep going people come in people go into the ministry\nAnd those who don't like the administration always looking for the ulterior reason doesn't appear to be you know ... and she said she doesn't have another job so apparently does not have an offer that's a substantial she decided to quit I think she just wanted a break all that travel all that stress\nPresidents have always complain about how the NATO countries and not a pony up the amount of money they're supposed to this president complain\nAnd did something about it [noise] for a job that you hear what the late nights every one is a teachable late night to the one Seventy four three I'm Larry
