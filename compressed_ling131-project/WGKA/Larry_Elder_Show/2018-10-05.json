four debate on the cabinet nominations did he just doesn't have to permit whether you disagree with is just a philosophy or agree with it or whether you agree with a\nA believe the allegations against him were not since they were all totally uncorroborated but picking sides there that either way he just doesn't have the temperament and uh\nThat's what's come out from Washington Post your time's a Heidi Heitkamp a senator from North Dakota Democrat a Democrat Senator Feinstein Democrat Senator Schumer Durban Doug Jones a lay here and there are there are certainly more\n[noise] but Janice on Facebook writes in that they keep talking about judicial temperament\nBut Kavanaugh wasn't being attacked as a judge he was being attacked as a person so he reacted like a person and he says that it is often\nA this was someone he was doing this uh uh primarily for his parents for his wife and primarily for his uh his children as well as daughters as well so let's go right to the phones a lot of calls to get through which can go right through and by order of those who have been holding the longest surely and Michigan on line one surely walk the J sexual live\nRight around the world for 'em I think we all have flat only be unfair for judge Kavanaugh\nBut for those that are taking that vote it's not often they have they have the courage that they're going to need to take the thoughts that we will turn number to pray for them but my question is if\nHe is voted in with the swearing in ceremony be Sunday so he can immediately start at the court on Monday or would they have to wait for any length of time to swear in\nSo they can happiness as quickly as as a I mean you get to vote and you can have the swearing in um the uh you kind of have the formal or a swearing in done very quickly within that immediate time period on Sunday and it can be more and more formal kind of ceremony even after that\nYeah I think it would happen virtually immediately Jordan I mean I think he would be over at the court on Sunday whether or not the swearing in happening or Monday morning or if he's confirmed by the Senate Jordan he's going to go to work immediately\nSo yeah so just to answer your question very quickly sure it happens immediately what you would likely be a kind of a small quick of it and then there would be a kind of a larger of it we're friends and family go um uh that's been the case for other nominees are\nUp but they start to work immediately states it back to the phones we go Stewart in New York on line three store welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nThank you for a while you do end up your support of Israel my question is in the ... cats\nIt has been a judge has his temperament that had been in this you\nKnow he got the highest rating you can get stored for baby a the American bar association\nWhich is very far to the left politically by the way but when they they they look at these judges they look at the kind of ... what ... how they conduct themselves it's not really supposed to be about it's not supposed to be about judicial philosophy\nUm and he got the highest ranking you can from uh the American bar association well qualified so that again there's been no issues about judicial temperament if you disagree with his usual philosophy but no issues about judge Kavanaugh's temperament at all\nAre brought up personal on the bench at work or throughout his career before being a judge or the twelve years he has served on the bitch back to the phones or we go mark is in California on line to Marcus welcome to Jay secular life\nThanks for taking my call these were the court may back\nEvery time I listen to them there's they talk about all they attacked first thing he he doesn't have all the game is basically\nThat is that basically it was it was at least a attempted rape or you know a a\nA SALT I mean ... these are serious crimes he was accused of mark is with no corroborate should even after another FBI airport no core operation no one will lead to even say you do say that that they have been heard about this ever occurred\nWell first\nYeah well it listed I mean this this is it's politics um the to permit issue again is it was just there next line of attack sees used to agree to be other quarter was actually say that\nIt's too angry too much aggression to be on the court that that was not him as again to fit it was ... judicial philosophy there who defending himself and there's a big difference uh back to the phones we go stand in Nevada on live for staying welcome to Jay so you'll live [noise]\nI I think I maybe I missed this earlier but I guess I Need to let you know I'm represented form of government I cannot in my mind that marriage and I'm not a summer like how ... ordinary Joe Manchin who have you with overwhelming uh references for one one direction [noise]\nTo even consider the other I mean are we sending people to Washington to do what they want to go on their own or they weren't reshape the wife\nOf the Democrats red state Democrats get through with talk\nThat never really became ... who was catching up to a job at this vote a say and I think that at a race was getting a just a is getting a bit too tight and the Democratic party moving a bit too far to the left so that you couldn't talk with no action just didn't really work but it ... been okay for them\nOr the high camp types of North Dakota of all places I think she's give it up\nBy this will be what I think she's done I don't think that's right because she does represent constituents like a state of said but uh but but say that I think for the Joe Manchin types are likely the party's moved so far to the left\nThat uh he's tried to talk like a moderate but not actually vote like a modern didn't work and now we're seeing potentially a starting to vote or like the modern he says he is I I think\nThis is one of the main reasons that Heidi Heitkamp race is basically lost for her Jordan I mean look the numbers for judge Kavanaugh in North Dakota in West Virginia\nAre basically identical he has a thirty percent approval rating a plus thirty pursue a percent approval rating in both of those states something like sixty two thirty in each of those states Heidi Heitkamp is a new one judge Kavanaugh and she's getting beat a rather ... by Kevin Cramer\nA then you look at Joe a mansion and he's going to vote yes for judge Kavanaugh or at least he he's a voted yes on cloture and he holds a you know roughly a six to eight percent lead a they're in West Virginia and I look at it voting record as you said to her
