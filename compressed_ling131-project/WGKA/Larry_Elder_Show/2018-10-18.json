you are of course lawyers and you have a legal perspective\nBut we can't let the legal dimension of this overshadow the strategic dimension sure preservation of this alliance with Saudi Arabia between Americans sodium ... is an indispensable to Israel right\nNow I don't disagree look I think there was an extrajudicial killing here means it was not authorized by a quarter ... an accident has to be taken\nBut I understand believe me that's what I've been saying for the last fifty five minutes that we do not\nWe can throw on all of our alliances on this\nUh as if there is not going to be consequences for that happening I think it would be significant consequences you can't improve the behavior and if the crown prince was involved allowed to be held accountable but uh this is a this is an awful situation and I think when you look at it we have to look at it through the geopolitical lenses again nine dimensional you're west I mean that's what you have to do\nThat to live there you don't ever want to sacrifice you know the strategic interest of the United states which have been you know those interests have been a part of that region for decades or national security or our intelligence intelligence gathering\nAnd order you know to to take a stand against it this awful thing that apparently has happened there are multiple options that the United states has to take\nA strong stand about this killing and do even punish the people involved without sacrificing our national security interest I think the president and the secretary of state or setting the right tone they're ignoring the glamour of the crowds on both sides of this issue\nA and a plug in for that because that I think they realize more than anyone exactly what is at stake and that we have to make a statement but on the other hand we have to protect the vital interests of our own country\nSteve's calling from Atlanta Georgia in line to Steve go ahead you're on the air\nOr anything and all you do and and yeah\nMany personality and I want to get the special like so it will be fine things though my question is like this\nTaking military alliance out of their wage and you know a lot of talk about the great thing and and the airplanes and all that are taking that\nOut of the equation can you explain it plainly what actions we have available assuming that MBBS hat on its ability\nWell there's individuals sanctions on them images the act that could be devastating not allowed to come to me the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the ... to the throne but you can't travel to the United states that would be a pretty big one so I think that it's it's a diplomatic response in that sense\nA but again the evidence has to be shown to establish that but that's I think I think that's where this is the focus of this was going to be found\nYeah and then look again Saudi Arabia needs the United states more than we need them even outside the military brown which is where we focus Jay you not only the Magnitsky Act but forty five billion dollars in trade between the United states and Saudi Arabia access to the U.S banking system without where she really cannot participate in the world economic market gay so look\nI'm you know I I think the question behind the question is if the determination is that the crown prince cannot be the next leader of Saudi Arabia how would the United states facilitate that\nA look at the United states that uh we're we're not going to recognize the crown prince or that will fracture our alliance guess what would happen he would not be the next king of Saudi Arabia us has that much in the hips\nLinda on Facebook that's a good question what would the world look like without a strong relationship between the Americans and the Saudis\nAre this would not be helpful just for our relationship but it'll be difficult for the whole relationship or an old region I gave you the history or the United states has had a history going back with Saudi Arabia since Nineteen thirty three that's one of the visual ties began\nAnd it's continued until today so I look at this colonels but it did say you've got to keep all of that in mind as you talk about whether it's sanctions or individual sanctions or would actually move forward here all of that has to be kept in mind\nYes all of that has to be taken into account and the congressional act allows financial sanctions against you know the people involved in this as well as forbidding answer to the United states you know the thing that that we also don't want to sacrifice and it's just been in the last few years\nThat Saudi Arabia has allied itself with us and our support of Israel and taking a stand against the the the Hamas and Hezbollah and all this data\nAnd ISIS they are our allies and this and so we can't willy nilly sacrifice that relationship but we do have multiple options and I think fans right we have enough influence with the king who is a pragmatic Matt\nUh followed his range for a while or if he will not sacrifice his own national security or his reputation in order to defend his crown prince and that's probably a park or this is going to end up the ground branch is going to have to go\nWell let me give me a for instance so are you talking about Hamas uh what's just as much as much as it let me get a picture for those on Facebook\nThis is what happened yesterday or two a apartment a indoor shooting up from Hamas\nUh destroyed it as you say uh there were three kids inside and apparently they are I'm In a trauma unit basically for a post traumatic stress disorder or or worse um they they were inside mother and child were a bridge when we're inside one was an infant so these are bad\nActors in this region and and Saudi Arabia while they been helpful on these issues are so that's why you got to balance all this but they don't get a pass\nOn doing this but it would also I don't think there's any question than you mentioned this in our ... year in

assume you're a Democrat or you're not\nI wasn't very happy that I changed to a Democrat 'cause I ...\nI see and the reason I assume that you're a Democrat is because many Democrats have said things that have been far worse and I'm Wondering whether or not you're equally outrage for example when a Howard Dean was chair of the DNC he says the contest between Republicans and Democrats is good versus evil and we're the good you have a problem with that\nI I don't recall\nI I didn't like I didn't think you did I'm not I'm not trying to ... or ... or the gay but I didn't I didn't think you

three months Ninety four percent of their news of Trump has been negative even as the economy is getting all time high unemployment all time low stock market all time high you'd think maybe\nThey can do a little better than Ninety four percent anti Trump coverage I'm asking\nWell he didn't lie about I think that Tom play and you had ... why\nWhy lie about all the things he's lying about
