[laughter]\nHey how are you going to [noise] wonderful friday\nWe're doing great did you hear the opening with their little segment of Mohammed Ali\nFact in ... I remember when caches clay was just becoming popular [noise] uh and he was not popular in our household dad couldn't stand him thought he was bragging mom couldn't stand and thought he was a record doors thought he was uncouth\nYou were the only one in the house I mean I I didn't have an opinion doesn't have an opinion one way or the other which was the only one in the house or who embrace him and you said you're going to become the next heavyweight champion of the world and dad thought he had a big mouth and we'll get knocked out by Sunday list [noise]\nNo I don't know why I think it was ... heavyweight yep restrain and I probably could stay out of a way of motion of every ... act I just want to remind\nAlso thought he was fun and entertaining Kirk and the reason I mentioned that is because surely before uh\nOh well I'm going to lead died a very close friend of his told me that they were watching the news and uh this is during the the twenty Fifteen is a time around and they're twenty Fifteen I think it was twenty sixteen early and he asked um Mohammed Ali who he supported for president\nAnd you know who said he said Trump\nAnd his before Trump became a real serious candidate and he said quote he's going to shake things up close quote\n[noise] wow he regret\nSo Kirk I'm trying to figure out how is it the Kanye West is a sellout an Uncle Tom when Mohammed Ali who's embraced loved by the black community or support supported Donald Trump and I'm either nobody knows that\nMohammed Ali supported him or because it's Mohammed Ali they gave him a pass I'm not quite sure which it is all I Know is if a con you went to the ... that must make Muhammad Ali one as well\n[laughter] one way to look at it kind of just going to catch what\nLeaders or whatever you want to call them are saying right now and that's you know give him from ... nice to kind of put is worth a little bit better\nWhat about the hammering he's getting Kirk uh let me check out this guy this guy's name a bakari sellers he is a democratic strategist that's how they build him on a on a on CNN on CNN listen to this\nI'm not sure he and using them as a prop per se but what Kanye West has done with Donald Trump is what other people have done who gravitated in his in his orbit which is just\nShower him with adulation for what reason I have no idea um but my issue with Kanye West is is quite simple um is that anti intellectualism simply isn't cool and Kanye West these issues as you say to these issues that they're going to talk about\nOur our issues that are that are central issues and many African American community they're very important issues\nBut the fact is we're not sending Kanye West of the White House to talk about these issues because he can't he doesn't have the depth to um I Want to hear what Kanye West wants to do when we're talking about criminal justice reform or prisoner reentry the fact that he cannot he doesn't have that that just the other day\nHe was talking about a spin programs and how we needed to have more than programs that had to turn around and ask his colleague what ... me and so what was what happens when it was what happens when negroes don't read 'em and then we have this now\nKanye West of what happens when equals don't read Kurt\n[noise] and it is it's kind of sickening 'cause she made her several really good point the rebels a little bit but he made several good points and discuss them and nobody knows what to do about the criminal justice system a welfare they we probably would have done something by now\nMichael Eric Dyson is another pundit or here's what he said about Kanye West\nPushes his white supremacy by rent for the cause I'm a black mouth is moving but white races ideals are are flowing from Kanye West smiled\nKanye West is engaging in one of the most and the various practices yet a black body and brain power the warehouse for the articulation and the expression of it and see black sentiments I don't know how much more I can take or\nWhat I found him after that you notice they didn't talk about the guy sitting next to a cognac Jim Brown yeah mhm not one single word has been mentioned about air it would fit right next door\nAnd he also Jim Brown said that he does not want to ... denigrate the flag a and where he playing in the NFL today he would not be taken a neat yeah\nNot a word has been said about vegetables\nWe got him when he got a little bit uh in in black media but not not the way Kanye West has been hammered\nNow Michael Eric Dyson also said this Kirk listen to this\nBut I miss the old time gay wanting to still that we're dealing with serious insidious forces that undermined is the ... who joined with James easy to talk about you know a black excellence and the quest for black excellence and that was being role black\nI missed the ... who loves to pack will say just the other day I got Lynch bought some crooked cops and to this day and I'm saying I'm going to be\nGetting major pay when I get my check they taking taxes out we we pay and the cops the not the black so I missed that Conyers who brings high intelligence his friend Jaycee said back then back when the police were al ... the black men there are ways in which hip hop can serve as a useful for him to articulate valuable ideas that\nPeople of color find residents\nIn the application to our situation\nRight now they're cutting a is a ... he was kind of a mess not Kanye West not cutting it as best and that's the real tragedy for my dear friend and great artist\nKirk I thought Kanye West me and a little bit [laughter]\nI mean Iraq I'm going to talk about jobs for the black community and start talking about that we need to focus more on the communities that have not been updated you know maybe get some job some industry or something and I was area actually made perfect sense to me\n... one of the things you said was that wearing the mega had made him feel powerful he felt like Superman he said because he grew up without a father and wearing the mega kept gives them a sense of power\nA David Gergen a is a guy that worked in both Republican administrations in Democrat administration he punted on CNN here's what he said about what Kanye West that about a wearing the ... to feel more masculine\nI agree with what you battered by both said a listen I and and I have no trouble with presidents and call and celebrities or the White House and enjoying each other's company\nYou know this has started way back where the water and heart in Nineteen twenty calling in al ... and then goes all the way after Richard Nixon calling in Elvis Presley and with cameras by the way he very much one of the cameras there are some that that\nThis is part of the present for tradition but I think what you're putting your finger on is a set the judgment that goes into doing it\nIn the face of this horrific storms so much suffering in the country they would have been so much better to postpone Kanye West for ... for four or five days a have conversations that became president can't go to the people\nWho have been suffering some I have a serious conversation in the White House for God's sakes about the relationship of storms the climate change and when we're going to do something serious about that as opposed to having us for ... and and\nThat is what is uh I I think so disturbing I don't know about Kanye West mental condition and I don't know about what I what I did pick up on something I hadn't really thought about he kept saying about this hats and putting\nHis hat on his head on they didn't feel like a man and I kept wondering is that what's going on with some other men in this country and their relationship with Trump is paying for Trump make them feel more masculine I just don't know the answer to that\nBut boy and there were sure and over time I was in session\nFor crying out loud Kirk I guess putting on mega cap is is cheaper or without side effects compared to buy agra I guess [laughter]\nI'm just shaking my head at it you know lower unemployment for blacks\nAnd instead of measuring uh just about so we're making headway so why would you stop that\nWe could go one little thing Gergen said this goes back a long way Richard Nixon calling in Elvis ... Richard Nixon did not call it an Elvis you know that story over showed up he just showed up and show that showed activists was hired\nTo when they showed up yeah I think he was a feeling feeling his oats and a ... and it made him an honorary a da ... something like that now he just showed up Nixon didn't call him in [laughter]\nThey made a movie about\nSure did alright ... we come back when I talk to you about this journalists who went into a Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey and this journalist never came out cookout Larry Elder\nAnd Kirk Democratic House member Sheryl Connelly of Virginia says that intercepts suggest that the Saudi crown Pence ... crown prince might have ordered a this operation\nDemocracy Huggies\nThis uh parents at the consulate in Istanbul, Turkey is one of the most profoundly disturbing development and international diplomacy bend our life is needs to be\nInvestigated bully and consequences need to blow up on the results of that investigation demographer show he is a legal resident of the United states the ... on the line in northern Virginia and he was known to\nA number of people in the community the mild mannered generous caring person there have been leaked details from Turkish government sources\nThat suggested the hidden team up Fifteen Saudis flew into is simple went to that constantly murdered and then this number the body ...\nCorrect Rand Paul says if this is true we shouldn't be selling the weapons\nRecall a couple of years now we've been supporting the Saudi efforts bombing in Yemen a ten thousand civilians have died but now that the Saudis\nHere to be involved with the killing of a journalist I think we shouldn't be selling them weapons we shouldn't be aiding and abetting what they're doing in Yemen and uh yeah signal needs to be sad I mean if we send signals to other countries that misbehave certainly we should send signals to an ally that this is unacceptable\nAnd I know what you're thinking what is Trump said\nIt was a I Will have to take a look at it exactly [noise]\nWhen you say released the journalist who you're talking to this is the price for that I'd have to look into I'm not familiar with I ask you to join us for that and\nI wouldn't be certainly consider that a fact we have a goal and to his wife his wife wrote us say letter and address it to my wife and myself\nWe were in contact with her now and\nWe have just a thirty second what do we do about this\nI think we should make sure you're ...

hopefully that's helping to and that we have heard good things about from point a mainly because they don't use proprietary equipment which means that you can add features like cameras for a lot less and you're not tied to them for the rest of your life if they don't meet your expectations\nI'm also has a lot of good fans a minute maybe good option for you if you're a fan of home automation simply safe is another one that's got a popular option going forward if you will or they've got proprietary equipment but it tries to make up for that with a sixteen a trial\nThat includes that equipment so if it doesn't work out for you you give the cameras another hardware back to them they're alarms don't require a monitoring plan and will continue to work without one which is not something that every

standards less confusing you well ultimately I think because in an effort to educate the general consumer streamline that process they say and create a more powerful standard\nBut wife I allowances ready to unveil why five six or might be the alliance you know some of the ... when he got it and allow as I say allowance yes you have to give me an allowance and like you know Thirty years and I have an earned it as a ... you're you're you're right the wife ... alliance\nIs allowing for [laughter] for\nUnveiling of wife fi six\nAlthough it hasn't been released yet why five six does more than just bring you more power it also changes the name of why why five six will be the successor to the latest standard eight oh two data Lebanese see well unless something confusing for the confusing part is that they renamed ac yeah\nNATO to five right and they renamed end to for I Know so it's about time though the the wife fi allowance alliance decided to change the name of it will also retroactively as Chris mentioned change the other standards even though\nThey're generally not being used any longer but clarity\nHe's a good thing yeah\nDid you should have been giving them numbers so on my ... well maybe they figured you know eight to nine eleven\nThere you go that's why and then especially since that you know they went from like a to a C and then ... and ... ... to ... ... that was the confusing price if it was they don't do that eleven ABCD fine we could have handled that as the general public\nBut all the different letters and not even in order and K fine but you know what that I'm Glad they're finally getting the big picture of took a long enough years and years and years but why find six will be the new one\nBy five five is likely what you're using now or at least ... for you don't even know it but that's what you're using [laughter] so we'll see what happens stay tuned into tomorrow because we'll get to stay on top of this because that's how Chris earns is allowance right\nNow some day if you cough or a sniffle chatting with Alexa sorry a voice assistant may respond back with an offer to sell you cough drops oh no\nRoss ... who is sick last week with a very bad cold would have been probably the first one to be sold cough drops\nAmazon was granted a U.S patent this week that describes ways for making Alexa more aware of your physical or emotional states such as if you're excited border even a little sick T there's that camera and that new thing there they'll know if you're excited\nIn a while Amazon has constantly working to make it like some more human like and knowledgeable it's unclear whether the ideas from his patent will ever be added into the voice assistant because you know the Amazon course didn't comment on this but yeah\nIt would have been better if your story was going to be that if you have the sniffles or cough or you're asking or something or whatever [noise] she'd say God Bless you or I'm I'm Sorry you don't seem to be feeling well or just something like that\nBut I'm going to send you some Vicks cough drops in charge it to your credit card or something it's all about the almighty dollar ... well that's true because Jeff Bose oh doesn't have enough money yeah that that I say his name right yeah pretty much be those Muslims or whatever\nKind of got more money than he should\nBe ... good on him right here and that he worked hard yeah and now he's paying of everybody minimum Fifteen dollars an hour but he's taking it from other exactly and that has caused so that's caused a huge uproar with a lot of the warehouse workers that have been there for years because they're saying that now these new people are going to come in and they're gonna be making what it took me years to make\nAnd the folks that have been there getting bonuses and things have said something to making the bonuses and starts up to stock options away from other employees pay for it God yea Jeff needs more of his own stock yeah\nOh my God [laughter] again you hit the nail on the head of the almighty dollar yes Alexa sent me some money\nAnd it's not going to work as a last time you went to grocery shopping and you had a special item on your shopping list you know and I and I wish I could also restrict voices talking to my Alexa because yeah I I Do build my shopping list and I I get to the store and I'm going through my list and what do I see on their\nMillion dollars for Chris what public didn't have it I asked\nMaybe next time they made it didn't rain check it no no rain check they did suggest however that I go buy a lottery ticket of course they didn't [laughter] that's all that they could do so there you go but I did have to hit the button that says I picked up that item so we got off my list\nYou know I didn't mind when your son did it because at four and five years old it's cute you know candy for cam and and I well you know what I'm going to get some because he was so cute and doing that\nBut I refused to get your million dollars at public supermarket\nFine so they're so stay off my electric and get off my lawn while you're at it in a boy\nFrom any drivers ways is the go to ... for getting around pesky traffic jams now the alphabet owned company is making a risky move into car pooling ... ways announce the nationwide rollout of ways car pool a dedicated app that lets drivers offer rides to people who are traveling on a similar out\nThe company says it wants to leverage it's superior routing technology to help commuters fill empty seats in their cars and in the process hopefully reduce the number of cars on the road\nDrivers are paired with writers with nearly identical commutes based on home and work addresses now in California waste corporate lawyers are charged a maximum rate of fifty four cents per mile which is the current IRS reimbursement rate for business travel by car and drivers and writers are limited only to rides per day\nSo you have to pay right but they're basically you're paying I guess you're paying a person who owns a car that fifty four since the mother saying there's not it's not a money making thing it's just a way to try to test the technology and get\nMore cars off the road tend to hopefully maybe reimbursed that person for some of the gas that they're spending and the wear and tear on their goals were the fifty four cents per mile comes to yeah which certainly seems reasonable if you'd rather not drive or you want to only drive one day a week if the you know five and your group work in the same general area\nThat kind of makes sense so I got to give them a little at a boy for that one if it works out yeah so we'll see if there's you know trying to roll it up nationwide so we'll see how it can that's on Google's ways right okay Google Maps\nHas a new commute tab available in eighty cities so far I present real time information on delays plus alternative routes an estimated travel times the Android version will provide updates to enable commuters to continually adjust their route to the void delays which I kinda thought it was doing anyway\nBecause if you use Google Maps it generally routes you differently or tells

see six continuous glucose monitoring system make knowledge of superpower visit decks com dot com that's Dee ex C O M dot com John in Mountain View California Welcome into tomorrow\nIs you're under ... review of all there are programs that qualifies capabilities and and lack of capabilities that would be very good to have to make sure you select the best one\nWell John frankly no uh there's a great number of anti virus programs and they're constantly being updated so reviews are never complete and don't stay up to date for very long unfortunately not your best\nBet is really to try to read as many of the reviews as you can when you're looking since things changed so much\nBut keep in mind that there isn't a clear winner because they're all for the most part relatively similar and there isn't a clear standout that his miles ahead yeah not a good thing with most of these anti virus programs is almost all of them that I Know of has some kind of a free trial Fifteen days thirty days so you can fight as many of them as you want to make sure you want to install the previous one for you and stuff but excellent yeah so you can find the one that you want and\nWant to pay for it because they will oftentimes conflict with each other so if you have a Boston there for example he's doing okay but I Want to try windows defender because I'm my windows user and I've got it already on the machine well fine but ... of Austin\nAnd try that one or any number of others and as Chris mentioned that most of them have a free version you can give it a shot and you know run the scan on your system or a couple of them at least during the free period and see if you'd like or some just have free up programs altogether\nThey're not going to have a lot of features to do other things for your machine but if they'll just protect you from a virus or than middle malware spam things of that nature in some cases\nGo for it but try and find one you're comfortable with if you if you asked ten people you're going to get ten different answers many times and none of them will be wrong yeah but the exactly true\nAndrew in Canada listens on AM eight hundred seat KLW the information station hopefully next time Andrew we'll get to hear you call in but meantime he sent this email says I just came across the program recently and really enjoy it well\nI have a ten year old Mac desktop which is still going strong and I have all the updates et cetera on it in three weeks my Norton Security is up for renewal and I'm Wondering with all the things changing et cetera is I have had Norton for a while but there's a better software out there that is better suited for my Mac or is better than Norton for firewall antivirus cetera\nAlso if I Do change it and get a new one I take it I should've installed Norton before and so\nYes we just said as a matter of fact but that school to get a couple of things together about anti virus and so forth so Andrew Norton is a good choice but if you're looking for a change any of the big names have anti viruses for Mac as well as those machines\nAnd you can find good options from a virus ... ski a trend micro so foes a bit defender\nBasically any of the big names and\nSince you're paying you should know that as we mentioned a few minutes ago that there are plenty of free options around so if you're concerned as the amount that it's costing you then there are plenty of those free versions that you can probably take a look at\nUs we should um install Norton said before you should definitely on install Norton before you saw something else if you don't want to be anti viruses may actually identify the other one as a potential virus\nUm to keep you don't want it to five or seven times so they don't interfere with each other and you end up unprotected yeah ... that's\n... it is important and it's weird because people have asked us over the years well how could an anti virus program think another competitor is a virus it just kind of works out that way because of of the imbedded code and things that are looking for and you know might have\nVirus names and go oh you know ...\nOr it could just read that their competitors and they want you to have their other went off the off your machine or any number of things but it just works better\nOr at all if you take off any previous anti virus you can always go back to them you can always installed again if you find you've tried two or three or four and number two was the best fine then punted stole everything else go back to whatever your second option was more details for you
