I'm positive it's over a hundred and I don't know the exact number ...\nI'm not I'm not calling with you I just never heard that number and I know there there are some I thought that was just a handful I certainly believe it's just a handful of industrialized nations where that's the case but uh but I'll check it out\nAnd I know most European countries are that way and obvious in Australia I'm On the southern hemisphere countries that I Know of but\nThen also that also makes that also makes Harry Reid wrong when he said there's no saying country that would allow this ... that clip by just not played you\nReally okay alright\nAlright well All right well I'll\nCheck it out I don't think it's nearly a hundred but Gregory check it out [noise] so of course I checked it out and about New Zealand let me tell you\nA what a New Zealand says children born in New Zealand or on board a ship or aircraft registered in New Zealand on or after January two thousand six will acquire New Zealand citizenship\nBy birth only if at least one parent is a New Zealand citizen or a permanent resident so I don't know how old the brakes kids but I'm assuming he's born before January one two thousand six in which case I I suspect that um the Greg is right\nUh but no more no moss ... as it were for July one two thousand six four New Zealand that for his assertion that there are over a hundred countries I'm counting about thirty five only one only to I Would be industrialized countries and that would be us and Canada the ones that have unrestricted a birth writes\nArgentina Barbados bally's Bolivia Canada's I mentioned chili Costa Rica Cuba America Ecuador El Salvador Gambia\nGrenada I'm waiting for the European countries that he mentioned that all of them right one of ...

four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen Fifteen sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen Twenty one twenty two and three and four in front of Tony I answered one two three four five six thirty six thirty seven little short of a hundred\nAnd not one of the European country now could be wrong if anybody has better information we provided this is just a kind of a quick look in their peers and Greg is completely wrong about his assertion that\nThat uh uh every a country in a in Europe or allows this in fact no country in Europe allows it or and even ... have changed their laws so I'm just saying I even knew it was looking at the data and are just not just don't see any great if you think I'm wrong call back and correct me\nAnd I've given you the quote from the draft or of that provision\nSubject to the jurisdiction thereof and the fourteenth amendment senator Jacob our hope this will not of course include person born in the United states who are foreigners\nSomehow some way that fourteenth amendment has been interpreted as meaning that anybody in this country whether legally or illegally better so us on on our daughter on us soil ah that son or daughter is automatically have American citizen nonsense says the draft or of the fourteenth amendment\nAnd a Trump is right that is certainly rare I he's wrong when he says we're the only country uh there are others though the other one uh I suppose that is um when my call significant is Canada\nAbout Greg ... and you heard him that to every country in Europe or has a this kind of automatic birthright and it's in every country in Europe does not in fact there is no country in Europe to dust so I've met you nailed it anyway thank you very much for the call I appreciate I Want to get back to the anti Semitism and the Democratic party\nBen and Jerry's is given twenty five thousand dollars to the women's march or one of who's co founders is Linda star sort of who's an advocate of Shariah law I David

fundraising\nAnd ah we never get help from anyone to clarify the connection between you hit these MSA or if you don't have much information as you can connect their lesson anew sees it can actually wasn't too clear in the ... just to clarify\nWhere were you a condemn from out of here and now\nI'm Sorry what when you condemn Hamas when I condemned for massive terrorist Oregon genocidal are you asking me to put myself on across [noise]\nSo you well I I actually had this experience many times you didn't read the pamphlet because the pamphlet this chapter and verse of\nMain connection is that the MSA as part of\nMuslim Brotherhood network has revealed in the document\nI don't think you understand what I mean by that and that if I say something I'm sure that I Will be arrested\nFor reasons of homeland security does he get please just answer my question if you condemn Hamas homeland security will lessen for it and that gives you a question for me to condemn the last ... they look really Mac condemn\nA modest obviously supported [noise] case closed [noise] I imagine it's very uh I I give you had this experience at UC Santa Barbara where they were fifty members of the Muslim students association sitting\nRight in the rose there and throughout my our talk I kept asking them William condemn his blah\nAnd I'm On a\nAnd then when the question period came the president of the Muslim students association was the first person to ask questions I said before you start you condemn his ... and he said\nQuestion is too complicated for a yes no answer so I said okay I'll put it to you this way\nI'm a Jew the head of his ... has said that he hopes that we will gather in Israel so he doesn't have to hunt us down\nRight so that's before they change the law so\nIt's obviously changed since then a Christian but he does have in fact you um Zealand passport mhm [noise] and uh obviously bigger change that and although my recollection of my\nUm thought a European countries having the same um citizenship by birth situation was that an accurate or may not be accurate I I'm not able to research it where I met with here's what I Want to emphasize\nThe Donald said we are the only country\nRight and he's wrong and and you dictated on on your show right now at least thirty five country\nCorrect that's correct okay\nAll all all the way by all of all all all of which all of which\nBy the Gregory in the western hemisphere except for except for Fiji and you said ah with with great confidence that every single European country did and you were just as wrong if not more wrong than\nDone or said most I think he's I think he said all of them believe\nThat my son was born in Germany I Believe he would be affiliated with German um\nRight citizenship McGregor point was that I'm not arguing that like I said I research with no but right with the main point is that Trump was wrong with Donald said as we are the only country that's why on and then he's got a new research before it blows up\nLike that you know Greg I'm I'm sure he's doing his research I gotta feeling he doesn't care I gotta feeling that his point is it's a stupid policy how outrageous it is it is where this about what two hundred and fifty countries in the world only thirty of which allow this and they're not big countries\nBy the way Ireland into the air is in two thousand five friends in the theaters in Nineteen Ninety three so I think his point is it's outrageous but you're absolutely right Greg or he is wrong he should be more precise I agree with you\nI appreciate you very much and I hope you're a great show up for much what I'll be back again\nOkay you got a great thank you very much a role in Martin a I'm a debate it and twenty sixteen over the election I told him that Donald
