what is it that we are talking about how do you describe what VR is\nFor our listeners who haven't done VR it's like you're inside of a movie as opposed to watching it what makes me are different is two things one is it tracks your body moving so the way you interact with a scene is by walking or moving your hands\nAre turning your head it's as if you are just grabbing objects and walking around the room the second differences at its perceptual surrounding wherever you look you see things they're sounds that are specialized there's touch that goes to your skin and\nIt's a perceptual experience that's not looking just at a scream wherever you are the content of their\n... you truly are immersed in whatever it is you're experiencing virtual reality\nThat we like to say my colleague Byron raises a first person to have this quote as the brain has not yet evolved to understand that a virtual experience isn't real if you think about how long evolution has taken its only very recently that we've had\nDigital media and extremely recently that we've had this amazing stereoscopic virtual experiences that you know that for so long when we've taken a step forward objects have gotten bigger when they get closer and that's how we are work so the brain is still trying to figure out\nIf we are as real ... and how compelling these experiences are\nAnd and what a great way to ah to to put that in that kind of perspective too I think it's awesome it every time I visit to especially China and we're seeing various trader Joes and they're they're showing virtual reality or they strap somebody on unlike the U.S which is such a ... society\nThey don't have a lot of lawsuits so they didn't let people wander and literally falling over on the floor and\nYou walk into the wall and

they're falling off a cliff for doing something and hitting the floor hitting a wall\nOf that is part of that immersion is not I mean you if you really are the brains taking over you were in that scene\nThey've I could tell you stories of lives I've saved in my lab people just deciding to spontaneously do back flip people\nDiving to cross this chasm that isn't there and and they're cutting

you're going it's useless so why does it all about what are the big issue that's why it's the ultimate issues that we're after all so sometimes\nSomething in the news provokes a subject on the male female our or for that matter the happiness or for that matter the ultimate issues that are not as the case today\nSo\nI guess it's ... it's a multi faceted question but it revolves around one issue and that is if you are middle aged adults\n\nIs it important in assessing you how you active in high school it's obviously based on\nThe Brett Kavanaugh nomination and that's the question you're how old is she exactly fifty four fifty three fifty for whatever you're so you're in you're almost mid fifties\nIf you let's let's let me put it to you this way if you had an important position in Europe business where your school\nAnd you had your ... agreement that man had led a remarkably good life as an adult in other words from the age of Twenty one so for thirty five thirty four years whatever has been\nA remarkable human being contributed to his community a family man\nIs a churchgoer which to me means something to many thousands would you then what do you pursue allegations of misconduct in high school\nThat's the question I wouldn't if I were hiring for ... for you\nAnd I I'm not talking about hiring a twenty two year old the where the proximity to high school is a few years I'm Talking about remember I'm Talking about the age of Brett Kavanaugh somebody applies for a job at ... university\nIs unanimous wanna find human being family man community man this person has been\nAnd then uh some charges are brought up about what he did in high school or even the exact same chargers okay I Would ignore them\n\nAnd it's clear what type of adult you would have been I'm I'm not going to look at what you were are alleged to do in high school\nSo that's the question that's the it's in how important in assessing a human being is their conduct in high school and high school alone\nNot not not a thirty nine twenty five but in high school\nOne aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nNow I don't have a I don't have a vested interest in this argument okay I I actually was a good guy in high school and I led an anti cheating on tests campaign that was elected the graduating class president\nI I was a bird was a good guy basically\nBut I'm I'm sure that you know things could be brought up I mean that I don't even know about\nOr that didn't happen which is I think it's a possibility or in the case of Brett Kavanaugh but happen or not happen if they\nWere kids in high school who were uh near two wells and who ended up fantastic adults\n\nSo ... who cares who cares and in effect now I care about how my kids act and high school I acted in high school of course you care about how your kid acts at the age of five\nThat's a separate issue you ... you because you you want to form a good person as early as possible\nI I agree with that but in ... in in the perspective of a life and in retrospect\nHow you acted in high school should have no bearing in undermining once assessment of this person in middle age that's my position do you think do you think it matters that's the question\nWhy Prager seven seven six\nEight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nBig stuff big stuff that people left to answer it's hard for me to believe that anybody listening even Democrats\nHiring a person for a an important position in their business Qunu what a terrific person this is and then charges arose from high school within say no I'm Sorry\nIt's clear what type of adult you've been put in high school are you uh you you robbed a a candy store All right that's pretty serious not not not simply\nNot simply shop lifted some candy bars but you threaten the owner and and you rub it\nBut it is obvious she turns your life around or otherwise what is what one is saying is people cannot turn their lives around we will let no point to acknowledge that you're turning your life around\nThat is why religious Jews and Christians find this notion particularly offensive because they're both Judaism and Christianity is so rooted in the importance\nOf penance of forgiveness\nOf tissue vi in in Hebrew of of return now or that's repented\nThey have is this famous Hebrew statement that I'm a I'm I'm\nLiterally translating from the Hebrew where a panic tin stands the most righteous\nPerson cannot stand the raw higher level if you turn your life around the person who never turned that life around them has been good the whole time\nThat's how that's how and and of course obviously in both religions forgive right forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us the whole the whole notion of Christ dying for people ... and forgiveness\nAnd the uh Judaism holiest days the day of of uh of penance since they've atonement Yom ... poor\nSo religious Jews and Christians understand of course people can turn their lives around\n\nSo uh I emphatically endorse the notion that when you are already in middle age and the lead a good life that's all that matters I have no interest in what you were like in high school\n\nAnd bribery where where's your cutting cutting off line is el is elementary school right well you know elementary school well yeah that's what people said until recently about high school All right when a Prager seven seven six\n\nAnd let's go to will in San Antonio hello will Dennis Prager\nI gotta I [noise]\n[noise] well yes\nI could just tell you a little story um\nI was a through

McLean is but people started looking around\nAnd pretty quickly a number of people find that she's a a former FBI agent she was twenty four years at the FBI including she was just in New York\nAnd that's significant because it gives your connection to Preet Bharara who's the U.S attorney who of vicious anti Trump guy\nAnd I'm just going to leave that hanging there I don't know how much you can action but it's a connection and as a reporter for reasons all explain I I'm going to put a little bookmark there now Monica McLean then came up\nIn a Wall Street journal story that came out on Thursday and this is major Thursday night by the way when the story came out about maybe she'd coach somebody with a very detailed account guess was the mainstream media did\nCompletely ignored it Fox broke the story there was nothing on CNN New York times\nWall Street journal date if they treat it like a Republican smear it's not it's a credible accusation with a lot of detail certainly more detailed and Christine Blasey Ford's accusation were obviously\nShe does not know the the date she doesn't know where it happens a lot of details mission so I thought it was credible but most importantly I don't want to point to solve this was coming from Chuck Grassley\nSo in other words the letter initially came program ...\nAnd that's important because this reason I I'm not trying to be optimistic here but I think Grassley will pursue this but if he doesn't it's patriots like you that are going to need to hold them accountable\nAnd we don't do activism on the right\nCertainly not the way the left us we don't need to scream but be prepared to politely call how 'bout that be prepared to make polite phone calls but let's let's play outlooks give it a couple of days so let me explain the other big thing that's going on the grass leaves letter before I talk more about this woman Monica McLean\nBuild a big thing is going on is Grassley sent multiple letters to the cats law for the law for representing Christian gloves before you sent three letters saying give me the therapists notes\nGives the Senate the therapists notes from ... doors therapist please give us\nA a number of other documents including the photos or video from the polygraph right they have not produced it Chuck Grassley asked to launch they didn't produce asking choice they don't produce a third time he's getting clearly upset and then after\nThe day of the nomination yesterday I guess what they announced oh we're not going to pursue charges against Brett Kavanaugh anymore well guess what Democrats\nMight be too late might be too late for you decided to pull out of this one\nI Am hoping that Chuck Grassley continues to push because here's the thing it's not their investigation is actually your investigation writes the people's investigation ... merely there are representative let's not fool anybody there he works for us\nBut it's his investigation it's not their investigation decide well we're we don't want to pursue this any more you brought up the therapist you brought up the claim she made show the notes because we know they gave them the Washington Post the notes the therapists knows we're given to the Washington Post\nNow the other thing it's interesting that came out yesterday was a guy named Keith ...\nMaybe ... to look it up you'll find him he's the first person that Christine Blasey Ford apparently\nSaid been named Brett Kavanaugh too that we have a clear record of\nAnd that came in a phone call on June ... June twenty seven\nStevens announces is retiring June twenty ninth and send them an email and the left is going nuts right now saying this Keith Coley letter will this proves that the FBI investigation was bad well first off ... you'll find he gave an affidavit days ago\nBut the other thing that significant is once again this is game playing he had an email exchanges Christine Blasey Ford nursing now well she told them in twenty sixteen he testified she told him and twenty sixteen it was Brett Kavanaugh well that'd be pretty significant\nIf somebody new in twenty sixteen but she said it was ... I missed that testimony she didn't say that but he's saying it okay well let's just take those words but what happened was in the same way they gave the Washington Post the therapist notes", "show_name": "Larry Elder Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "07"}
