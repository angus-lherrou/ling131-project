scooter at the state level he said where there is no laws that's where we go in\nA bird is the first company to launch rental electric scooters in the U.S [noise] um it's also the fastest growing

ozone and particulate matter or in the environment teeth so you've got to be a chemist in all this\nBut they don't measure air pollution yeah cars driving around the street and report back and then

gone everywhere\nBecause Twitter says the fish but we make a lot of money off ... you're going to take the the ... but we'll do it to okay let's drop off\nThe bridge together\nAlex how you doing on the street I'm doing okay it's America that's in trouble\nCom or call a four four forty three Bible that tape for for forty three Bible met his share dot com or aid for for forty three Bible [noise]\nTwice [noise] she and her\n\nAustin, Texas broadcasting worldwide aids Alex Jones [noise]\nRoger Stone John Judge them big breaking news you flip on a play here and just a moment of

million dollar a\nWar and if you can find me saying now so he doesn't care\nHe's ... he's a horrible person he wants to ban conservatives off the Internet which is now happening and mash there's the articles you know of any of them congressman pressures Facebook to ban and force during a wide herring\nDemands and know how many ... twice because it would take to bring down and pours well don't worry thousands was eight hundred on Thursday it's thousands down ... living libertarian in ...\nOn Facebook and Twitter or totally banned they don't even do strikes now they just said\nYou know political spam your speech\nOut promoting the cop offensive Trump that American Republicans the Democrats in her violence that can run around screaming and yelling make no crazy they can they can say go out and burned down Republican buildings but you'd all promote the economy for ... percent\nYou don't promote Trump delivering on you know that spam the big tech is decided we'll get to that in part two of the discussion but at the time we have\nRoger let's get into haired dog cheer had died from white there where you live in Florida\nA and a mobile played a clip of the moment and what his what the inside baseball is on what he's doing\nWell Alex a congressman Ted joy to as you know is a leader in the effort to a race the second amendment and take away our firearms\nOr has launched a quiet coup attempt to challenge Nancy Pelosi for the speakership in the event the Democrats win the majority\nIs subterranean campaign consists of raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for a major democratic donors around the country and then very carefully and strategically funneling money only two Democratic candidates who commit to doing\nFor the overthrow of polo said\nDon't be shocked if this right now is the first time the speaker has heard of this but my sources are impeccable because George has been leaning on major democratic fundraisers here in the state of Florida to put up the cash for his attempted coup\nI liked the rotten blamed\nYou know kind of zombie pullout horrible marriage I enter a huge criminal but the young younger more wicked I mean to more of a devil actually train dodge I mean we don't want him to get the power so we want to make sure she knows all about this and it's a little tough\nWell I think the important thing that people are realizing Ted Deutch is not for the election of all Democrats is only for the election and House Democratic candidates who commit to his overthrow a town\nNot only this guy had one of his ground has beers that I've ever said but he is a hard core opponent of the first amendment he despises ... you can see I'm trying to shout out Laura loom or which let's face it\nThat's a hopeless task but he is among the worst the worst in terms of as extremism he makes a Nancy Pelosi looked like Barry Goldwater is so far out on the life the way so the socialist wing of the Democratic party as personified by Ted Deutch is making their move\nI and I think it's important that Democrats need to know that not only is doing it's not a team player but he has a farm takeover of the Democratic leadership on his mind now whether dogs could proceed with this plan\nAnd try to take out polo see as minority leader or whether he is just committed to overthrow the speakers contest is not clear to me\nIn any in any major you should be doing what the porn lawyers doing where he's claiming this to elect a hundred million dollars\nWell it's possible but uh the the two different fundraisers who told me this both told me\nThat it was very much on the down low that it was very much crushed caution that George did not want it around Washington or around the country that this was what he's up to he's trying to pick up I used from democratic candidates\nBut I'm also told that he his arm twisting up front for commitments in the event that there is a leadership fight so there are things years in the Democratic party personally I think they are\nGouging their chickens or before they are hatched on the other hand Alex I don't think many have thought through the political implications of the death but the the extraordinary devastation\nAnd Florida which has hurt the most conservative part of the state northern panhandle while they're still probably has a majority of registered Democrats by registration\nIs habitually probably the most Republican could that could that for other states or to the Democrats\nMost certainly it is a major problem and I don't know how you deal with it the devastation the photos that people have said to me when I heard from congressman Matt gates who represents the district or this looks like drugs then after World War two it is extraordinary or even if you could put up temporary polling places\nThe populist has moved out and moved on and there's no place for them to sleep there is no fresh water there's no food there is no gasoline so the most conservative part of the state needs to be taken out of the equation\nThere is no question that this can affect the election for governor the election or for the U.S Senate and of\nCourse the other statewide offices agriculture commissioner CFO attorney general or so on it is\nA lot of their tenacious I mean they're going to go find a place to poll but they don't get to that they should be a major issue to shut the emerging bowling vices I mean I mean yeah exactly I mean in in a new to me the other counties that are they doing\nWell remember that this also in Florida a majority of the voters are cast either in advance\nThrough absentee ballots or through extensive or early voting that's the good news as the Republicans figure out how to salvage this situation\nBut it without any question has real implications for coming election you know what I'm saying I got mentioned Alex that I really have to talk about oh not yesterday for extraordinarily long run I Randall further than I normally do last
