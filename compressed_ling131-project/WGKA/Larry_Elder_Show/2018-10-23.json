in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico\nWe as a country per year except about one million legal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency changes I

uh you know president for Republican and medicines and and this has\nBeen going on for a long long time um but you know\nI wanted to ask you you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has belle any policy for anybody who entered the country illegally that's right my my bigger question my bigger question is if Mexico is\nAnd from what I hear they have a large there and be willing to help you you say that there are pretty much just escorting them and kind of you know um how you protect warm or whatever they're doing and how is it that these people are not rounded up by the federal rally

Will tell you this\nAh it is a tough issue but we got to think through this and be very strategic and very careful in how we engage it I again 'cause my position is we should be doing everything I'm sure we are\nRight now to avoid a confrontation at the border and that means intervening now with Mexican authorities or Guatemala and Honduras Venezuela wherever the individuals are coming from or where they are now to see if you can contain it\nAnd get humanitarian aid to them where they are rather than having a confrontation on the U.S Mexican border which does serves no one's interest including though so you can you come to the United states\nSo I that's my position on this we're going to go back to the phones at one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten one eight hundred sixty four three one zero now and go ahead you're on the phone you're on the air hey\nHey look you already given your solution a few minutes ago we have the rule of law and when you want to do an intervention we simply informed the papal not the government the papal coming toward this border\nThat our laws say you cannot enter illegally use our troop because we want to protect them they won't fire there well trained season troops and tell the people if you enter the country illegally it will be arrested you'll be photographed\nIt will be by a metric fingerprinted whatever and you will you never you know what the ... go ahead go ahead\nPlease wait it never enter the United states again that's the penalty for break that was\nI I get all of that but I'm I'm telling you I'm gonna go to west Smith on this with fourteen thousand people hitting your border within let's say a couple of hours or even if it's I don't know how how do we have a limp will of how far the from the front of the Caribbean to the back how what's the time differential when people reached that point\n[noise]\nOkay so you're going to have these so it's not days in lines it's miles in length\nIs that what you're saying\nSo what I'm trying to figure out is what is the number of of people\n\nSay that multiple waves of this and this puts it just a tremendous amount of pressure on the on the border go ahead west\nYeah and they're not only walking many of them are being given rides by people in trucks and cars and what have you yeah and um you know it is one of the things that that we we we really need to go\nAnd it'd be proactive about this and go if if the Mexican government will allow us to do it to go on the other side of the border to help them out of this has the potential to be really really ugly if it gets to the U.S border what I'm Amazed that Jay is that that you know think about national security and that's that's the hammer that I use all the time but\nIf you took terrorism and the threat of terrorism if people crossing our border illegally that's a big deal I mean a few years ago we could not imagine people using box cutters to to hijack airliners\nWe are not really understanding the threat of a porous border how the people who wish to not only do us harm but to topple our government can come through with weapons of mass destruction if for example to cross the border but take that out of the picture terrorism take the drug cartels out of the picture if for no other reason than the human trafficking issue\nThe Democrats should come together with the Republican counterparts have meaningful border security immigration reform\nBuild the wall because the human trafficking I think is the moral ... that that isn't at center of all of this guy agree Benjamin calling from Texas alone when Benjamin\n... is our\nHello is this is from Texas how can we help Mexico separate this massive group smaller or manageable groups\nWell it's a great question so one of the things I was asking her producer if they're they're they're they're talking about waves the question is uh from the beginning of this\nWhen it would hit the water in the United states to the end how long of a period of time and we don't have a clear answer on that right now is it is a days or is it ours we don't know it doesn't appear that we know that information yet which we don't know I Would but I think it's the intervention before it gets there\nAnd that's the whole idea is to prevent it from becoming a mob scene at the United states border where you have this\nPotentially disastrous slaughterhouse of a clash between these uh\nMigrants if you want to give them a charitable denomination and\nThe and the sovereignty of the United states as the president says we've got to have border control and we've got to if we're going to be a country if we're going to be a nation we have to have borders and we have to respect those borders the challenge\nHere is what do you do when you have seven to fourteen thousand people clamoring along in a thousand miles line this is how long they've taken to get here\nTwenty two hundred miles away some say they have now reached the point is there's still a thousand miles away from the border but they continue to move and they continue the mass\nAs they move the mask gets bigger the mask it's crowded bigger therefore you've got to stop them before they reached the border and intervene to create manageable groups of people and\nTo provide them with the humanitarian assistance\nThen I think would be appropriate for on America to do but before they reached the\nGood news is there are thousands of miles away so there's time to figure out how you can engage this because right now we don't know how the how the ... what is the plant of of uh uh intersections so to speak at the U.S more what were the what were the people coming over planning on doing\nWhen they planted or just walking over where they planning on running the gates I mean I don't know but we've got time to intervene there's there's ways to do that diplomatically and politically and and it's a cross is a bipartisan issue the should it's a humanitarian issue too but you've got to be able to protect the borders or else was going to be anarchy Clyde calling from California go ahead you're on their\nGuy thank you so my question is are we ... a bipartisan support particularly in California with you know we know how the leaders here feel about the state they declared it a sanctuary state or so how are we seeing all democratic support on this issue\nYou know because it's such a large scale\nSo far I I don't think there's there's been much made Congress's out this week so we it's it's hard to get a read on the here and our executive producer will Haynes have we have we seen any comments from any Democrats or Republicans that men are saying what would you do hear\n... security after all I didn't grow up they stop me\nDon't have the job I was a

I just kind of mentioned the ... detective gym would whose undercover narcotics officer he's the one that made this all happened\nIf it wasn't for him none of this would have ever come to light and in fact as you said you know and it's true the FBI and the da ... only focused very much on the drug case\nBut Kim would said what about this woman who died this woman kind of my monger who died why don't we why are we talking about her\nAnd because eventually because of gyms perseverance and they actually ... opened up the ... the the the the homicide investigation into the deaths of kind of my mongering once you once they did that and we're allowed to search for evidence that connection with her death\nThey found everything else and the other of course big point of the movie is that initially the mainstream media didn't care about this case yeah it's amazing and the reason I didn't hear about it because it makes them have\nVery unpleasant thoughts about abortion yeah and they don't want to go there no no they don't want anything that might in fact you know ruled by you know have any effect on roe v Wade\nAnd this film certainly do some ... ... am portray abortion a very good light because you've got to hear about abortion and you don't hear it from a pro life activist you hear it from two of the you know during the trial too good abortion is to legal abortion is for us to understand to describe a good abortion\nAnd when the when the jury heard what good abortion sounded like they didn't see much of a distinction between that\nAnd murder mhm [noise] um I ask you this before when we interviewed a golf now Rick regarding the the drug stuff I'm sure he he he's aware that was illegal I'm sure you got he's got conscious of consciousness guilt about that but about the abortion I got the impression he didn't make you done anything morally wrong\nNo not at all in fact you know he feels you'll be vindicated that he was helping poor women you know that he you know he really is a hero to the poor\nYou know at some level he ... certainly claims that that is the case you know when he I mean even worse by the way and I know we're at Salem Radio station I mean can you imagine he also had\nScripture passages have given me scripture passages that justify abortion to justify what he did he's written poetry pruning when one of the comments he wrote pruning and you can imagine the reference he was using that that we need to prove and for things to grow well I mean I really extraordinary but he's\nYou know match to me he is a complete a lunatic\nBut it's all the people that are enabled him to make a make for very chilling reading and very chilling knowledge\nAnd ... and he is my guest she is the co producer of the movie ... the untold story of America's most

forty five thousand dollars as your insurance company says oh I don't it covers so much and Canada\nEverybody pays according to your wages so if you're making ten dollars an hour it might have to own
