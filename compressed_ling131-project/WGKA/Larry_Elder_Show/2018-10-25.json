willy factor back home studios available she's one of the answer here in Cleveland, Ohio the\nRock and roll capital of the world thanks for joining us we've got one hour to go seven minutes after the top very much looking forward to more of your thoughts on the phone lines\nJammed with people wanting to talk about nationalism they want to talk about pipe bombs and fingers of bland they want to talk about caravans of people invading our country by way of our southern border I had a conversation I wanted to share part of with you\nWith a ...\nI talked with him cause some earlier today he was one of the first people to start using this term again\nSeveral years ago trying to revive it because of its actual meaning it had been given a negative connotation by some who are looking and you know what are we talking about political correctness in this uh open to the to the show there in the open to the our you know this uh this is the following his ready to be super politically correct\n... the only thing politically correct the about me when I Do this thing is that my politics are correct my politics are right that's the political correctness that I'm about as far as being not offensive I don't care\nI'm not about not offending people and neither is ... now he's a fellow at the middle east forum the gates donating Institute and the Lincoln fellow at the Claremont Institute he was a former senior advisor to brags that leader Nigel for Raj\nAnd he knows about nationalism he knows that it means taking care of yourself and your nation first not about racial politics not about identity politics it's about the nation versus global is\nNationalism versus globalism\nIt's exactly what President Trump was talking about it was not a ambiguous it was very very clear so I wanted to talk to Rahim ... about what nationalism remain since they have that experience there and as I said\nHe's one of the first people to kind of revive the term as the president said when he said you're not supposed to say it anymore and it's ridiculous to say to not be able to say I believe in my nation first this this is part of that conversation with for him to sort of\nThing you have a map to I have to say I wasn't one of the first\nAs a given that given that nationalism goes under the ... he is but certainly may live in in a multi ... we were introduced to a political lexicon boat across the across the ocean I'm here in the United states\nI think that's that's a that's a great point a great distinction in and let's let's talk about that as as the president declared a correctly when he when he tried to draw the contrast between globalism thinking more about the world's up a needs rather than the needs of the nation that you are elected to represent the president said that very directly\nOr that he means nationalist and that I'm going to put my people first we're worried about the concerns of less than the rest of the globe second\nUm he said that national him is kind of like nationalism is kind of become a word that you don't use anymore and I think we should use it again what do you mean and why he's right of course because you saw the instant reaction right hand but why did a tour nationalism which when compared to globalism\nIs a pretty benign term as far as I'm concerned that says more concerned about our people before the world's beep\nBut he because there was actually a big role to generous about globalization I mean I Believe that if you think about what a dog\nUm over the past Fifteen or Twenty years actually it hasn't really considered itself with the rest of the world it's considered itself with a political and cultural and leave your leech a around the world whether it's in Beijing London or New York city of Los Angeles\nYou know really ... to ... be addressed um all the very very very few\nAre not very very very few have been you know exploiting workers the folks on factories in\nA ... jobs from Racine, Wisconsin\nAnd social circle now I see the reason you get it\nAin't Trump Shea ... ... ... people up and blow the media rockets specially because it ... out for several years I think people who have studied it live by the way I see\nOver the course of his life especially when he talks about trade deals and that sort of thing that he had these national which to me is that he's there actually come out and said it and ... and ... and ...\nBy saying it is is crazy gets another dividing line is very good at doing that is a dividing line that he knows that the that sort of the city to the machine the Democrats the media all of those guys\nThat they have to attack that line they have to attack that product and they told me that that's very very hard at all I think it's not what would you be easy indefensible even at the age of Seventy whatever he is um and they do have the lecture logging and so they can't fight the idea of nationalism there to fight the idea\nThat the nation states shoot to be the final ... should be ... is almost impossible especially amongst Americans I mean you'll you'll you'll revolution was nationalist rent Lucia\nHow much Hamilton is on the subject of ... was a national issue document um you know what ... years ago said about how does one ... one of them one language\nAnd say goodbye to the immigrant you're willing to simulate is nationalism and they don't\nAct arguments against that so that's why it they're angry they are upset that you can get another from all ... and that's the that's what we've seen play out last routes\nI think that's well said the only argument they do have against that is to just say just scream racism which of course is the you know the easiest argument to make a ... is our guest is a fellow at the middle east forum the gates though Institute in Lincoln fellow at the uh Claremont Institute you know the president said when he pulled out of the Paris climate accord he said look\nI care more about and I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of Paris and another event he said in his first year in the presidency I was elected president of the United states not president of the world\nHow can any elected official whether it'd be president a member of our Congress or anywhere else suggested otherwise your job is to represent the people that chose not to represent the interests of outside nations especially if it comes at the expense of those who chose to lead them\n[noise] you know that's that's a really great point and and there's actually been touched the book is just come out on this subject it's it's clear picture of nationalism spy a professor older your I'm ...\nAnd and he he sort of explains his childhood and and it's it's ... and ... I mean the rest of the world's all you know the United kingdom on and I'm staring at\nA uh an empire the one hand right now you know it it sort of ... dominant historically imperialistic global is deeply\nIs looked to one leader you know whether it's the king of England\nOr the Holy Roman emperor ... used to have a story ... ... words to one person where they are they will\nAll several people wherever they are going well and the world is currently doing that occurs hysterically done got over the last few decades was the president of the United states you don't have these are good to build\nA ... in that in the in that office is referred to as the world leader the most powerful man in the world you know all of that sort of thing and and it's it's it's a refreshing you're set don't just I think Americans were trying to\nYou know point trillion dollars being spent in Iraq and Afghanistan but to that it should be no money for public schools and it's a right\nUm I think it's refreshing for them but it's also refreshing I shouldn't be refreshing but the rest of the world where nations like Italy and nations like the United states hated and nations like India stray an an a a three independent sovereign nations\nActually don't have to act as protectorate charitable they actually do have to act that independent sovereign nations and this was another thing that President Trump strength when he talks about ... so he says look I'm not kidding\nSo she'll protectorate started looking ... allies and and so this is a major reset what's going on now I'm ... and it it seems to me just say that he will court nationally there yet says there was a period in history where nationalism uh\nEthnic nationalism specifically but very very quickly and spiraled out of control but it pains me the people don't know that nationalism right she goes back hundreds and hundreds of years and still looked like many countries most countries I Would say around the world but for whatever reason\nWhat can you do for this nation maybe not for the world not for the United nations\nNot for you know foreigners what can you do for this country that's your job that your responsibility because it is about us versus nation first that's or national doesn't mean that is not a dog whistle it's not some sort of a coded language is simply a statement of I pledge that's why I said this before I pledge allegiance to the flag\nOf the United states of America anybody who's ever re sided that pledge is saying\nThis is where my allegiance lies don't pledge allegiance to the flag of the United nations don't pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada or Mexico or to France or Germany or to uh to uh\nUh Switzerland or to uh to the Dominican Republic or to a Guatemala or anywhere else I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America\nAnd that means I'm a national ...\nThere's no coat in it there's no racism and that there is no bigotry and then we need to stop this nonsense right now stopped letting the Democrats define language to us Diane is calling us next from Greenville South Carolina Thank you for joining us now and go right ahead\nHey how are you wonderful day for a couple of things as a as a true patriot and a non ... apple up things first thing is the last spring getting what happened it out and say look at look at people\nTrump is drawing tens of thousands of people um than Trump's right at the ...\n[noise] you know what they invade or something I call them what they are invaders if they're so big on socialism\nTended thing why aren't they added to Venezuela to why we can carry that flag of the country that is a precedent that you hate why would that\nNot only are they carrying though the Honduran flag on this um march ... word\nNot only are they carrying that they are chanting\nAgainst president Donald Trump they're chanting negative things like empty but doesn't American streets about Donald Trump and yet they are going to come to the door\nAnd said Donald Trump let us in lettuce end of the nation that we don't like lettuce end of the nation are you as the true the president of somebody we don't like\nBecause it's still better than where we came from I I had been asking the same question but Diane since this whole thing began\nHow can they expect us to want to welcome them in when they're not leaving the American flag saying we love you and we want to be like you wouldn't be part of you know waving the Honduran flag saying we want to invade you and bring Honduras to you and that is correct that is

let me say it again but these pipe bombs that have been sent to politicians are called acts of terror and there's nothing else to call them\nOther than an actual terrorists are the these are there's been a ... reports now that a second suspicious package was said to Delaware postal facility or a project designated for former vice president Joe Biden you have to take that situation take the situation that you have also and I think this is again\nIf these are we don't know who's responsible for it but they're trying to send some kind of message and that message is Tara but it's a violation of state and federal law make no mistake about it and then the United states of America we do not have political discourse by pipe bomb\nThis is not the way we do it you could have bigger as disagreements we should not be screaming at people in restaurants we should not be yelling but we should be doing is exercising our constitutional rights\nIn a in a in in civil discourse it could be listen First Amendment free speech says it can be robots uninhibited that's where the language and the Supreme Court but this is not free speech Peter acts of terror pure and simple\nThat's what it is yes and and and so this needs to be completely condemned as as having no place\nIn America or the American political discourse and I think that the uh this a blame game that the media is trying to do a let's be honest there's been a lot of rhetoric on both sides of the aisle here including most of the media and I think with the president said\nUm everyone together he said everyone at the speech um included him included a politician is the other party but also included some media outlets\nTo say you don't call it down um and then at things should improve and we shouldn't have situations like this now we live in a country where we do have freedom of speech and these\nAre politicians can say they've got that same freedom of speech you know they've got a ... a as some of the bigger than others and they may say things you don't like they may say things that make your blood boil\nThat's fine in American politics you get to respond and ultimately are we the people as voters decide who represents us in each of these government positions whether it's the White House whether it's the U.S Senate the Congress state governors\nThe local government school boards there's all up to us we vote and there's an election coming up\nVery soon that will impact our Congress and will likely impact a lot of your state government\nAs well we don't get into all that on the national broadcast like this but a lot of governors races in a state houses state Senate races simply races all goes on you need to get out there and exercise your right to vote Tracy of Facebook's that Jordan you mentioned solving at the border so managed with the border what does that look like\nI said that looks like the U.S than having to go through each of these people which is what happened in April so April twenty two you would have ended up started with about Fifteen hundred that was considered big\nThis would be the smallest estimate is thirty six hundred the largest estimate is over two thousand you would estimate is seven thousand so this is much bigger than what we dealt with in April in April the Fifteen hundred windows down to about five hundred when they reach the border\nThose who were were apprehended at the border one hundred and twenty or so or were arrested immediately for illegal entry so they they had no a right to to enter and no good claimed to make a for asylum\nOr another about Ninety percent of that remaining group is in the asylum process now so a few hundred\nAre the asylum process I think this organization likely if they do make it to the border with those uh down that way too where the people who actually get to the border yeah go through the process may actually have a claim that can be made and by the way that that process takes a long time so that means they got through an initial step\nSo out of five hundred over a hundred were arrested\nAnd are about three hundred so got through the first asylum process step but I imagine that tenfold for us to deal with that is something that I get we have time to prepare for like President Trump said but we should we should get this fixed before we're on the border Texas or the border California\nAll right we're taking your calls at one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten other comments are coming in as well ah Alison Facebook says it's such a tough thing to deal with balancing compassion with keeping our border is secure it is at ... I I don't ... I joined so there were legitimate asylum seekers in there\nBut you gotta you gotta get through that process and and we don't want to not be combat and that's why I Want to avoid a border confrontation\nAbsolutely and so I was a made a very very good point that balance is clearly necessary\nSo we have to balance the interest of the United states in the rule of law the integrity of our borders and are keeping criminals and others wrote a with compassion but the way to do that is to engage in negotiations to prepare\nA ... I'm American officials and Mexican officials to deal with a problem on the ground before the caravan reaches us ports of entry and so it's essential that we focus on that there is clear evidence from news reporting that the U.S has\nEngaged in some negotiations with Mexico and these negotiations indeed are bearing fruit\nOr Julian Facebook says thank you for sending the standard for civil discourse them she says she loves ... as well we appreciate that Julie but we're trying to give you a rational these are these are both these issues that we dealt with today be suspicious packages that would look like the pipe bombs being sent to politicians and others in the media\nAs well as the situation or with the Caribbean and they're very distinct but we we've got to be level headed and how we deal with it but I Want to be really crystal clear on this especially on this issue because I'm hearing these kind of mixed messages from some\nOf the fact is that these are acts of terror legally speaking\nThere's no question under federal and state law these are actually feel to wait for a ... a device to go off before it's an act of terror\nSo these acts are acts of terrorism and that's what we have to remember and and that's what local and federal law enforcement or engage\nTime for following has been rated DC for politically correct it tends to sway learns say every elder

states or your copy today at destination movie dot com death of a nation movie dot com did ... did it so you know it's compelling so go get that destination movie dot com okay the mystery packages the story seconds the finger pointing continues\nAnd let's make a list what we don't know and what we know this is how you stay sane throughout this entire thing right now my list of what we don't know\nAnd what we know may differ from yours you may think you know some things that I don't you may think some things that I think I Know are in dispute and that's why we have telephone lines are so um do joined us\nHere's what we do not know we don't know who sent these packages and cat could we started the most basic we have no idea who set these packages or why [noise] uh and that's where you stop your toes for the first time\nIt's like wait a minute don't we know that this is some expression of hate for for liberal or I kind of figures clearly sent by some nut bag on on the right\nWe don't know any such thing goes that probably the greatest possibility yeah because we have are not banks to\nAnother little boy left as guys who shoot up baseball fields and and the left has tons of people who uh will shock you out of a restaurant and claw like zombies doors to the Supreme Court and do all kinds of other who feels off nonsensical thing we've uh we've we've got our crazy too\nBut you know the thing that that started to wrap itself around me when the story first began and\nAnd the tally of mysterious packages started to grow said you know doesn't tend to be something we do and they are\nAnd why in the world would exactly be now that's earth logic why would you do it sometimes you send somebody a pipe bomb 'cause you want to kill him but you know ... nothing exploded yet you know what I mean\nAnd I think that it was the one in sources mailbox where the where the the white powder was nothing it was in art now and then by the way that doesn't make it okay if you send somebody something just to scare the or the ... out of them that's that's a terrorist act as well\nSo you don't have to blow up for you to have done something very very illegal\nBut is it okay for you if you keep that\nThat hoped antenna primed and dialed in you bet it's okay mine is\nDoes it mean I'm declaring it hopes I'm telling you I Know it's a hoax I noticed the left doing this to the left so that we can you know spread out and have some myths of equivalency\nLike yeah we're ... we got a lot of restaurants were chasing Ted Cruz out of restaurants we got Maxine Waters advocating hooliganism but you have your crazies do you're trying to to the Clintons are the Obamas and Joe Biden and Robert De Niro you people are just like us yeah\nNo we're not okay\nBecause even if even if we do find that this is one conservative lunatic you know what that is one conservative lunatic we have more\nTo be sure but um it it's not our rank and file really hopped up activists who are doing things that countless thousands of leftist are doing\nAll the time there is no comparison so the thing we don't know is who did this and why we do not know\nHere's what we do know a media culture that take Trump's God's will do anything to tag him with this bad story\nAnd that is why you actually get I mean I I heard Wolf Blitzer I was kind of funny I was getting out of the car rental serious actually I'm In the car Wolf Blitzer talking to some congressman or something so we know where we have CNN just if you ever have the president's ear tell them that we we really try to get things right we're not involved and fake news like will shut up\nDude it's pathetic it's sad when I got a great idea if you dial the lemon you know want to go you know build a tree house in the backyard never a club
