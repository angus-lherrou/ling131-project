I didn't even try to get you up at seven o'clock this morning I'd even try to get you down at that a political rally this morning [laughter] I said a several people said where's where's your brother I said well\nYou know my brother kind of had bankers' hours [laughter]\nSo Kirk let's talk a little bit uh Kavanaugh here did you watch the speech by Susan Collins\nYou're having to watch that one and I was very impressed with it [noise] it was kind of reminded me of Lindsey Graham a little bit more methodical more control and more based in strict point\nI just tweeted a move over a Lindsey Graham the base has a new favorite moderate Republican\n[laughter] she she didn't really find\nKirk how is it that the Democrats and look at the FBI reporting conclude that there was no cooperation and excuse me Republicans can include there's no cooperation of the allegations made by Dr Ford and the Democrats and look at the same report and say that there's all sorts of evidence\nMisconduct in the Kevin report let me play Cory Booker for you the senator from New Jersey the one who's very likely going to run for president well first of all I mean those characterizations for me are uh\nPet 'em out to just ... trading a sham on the American people because there are clearly a many witnesses or people that could have cooperated or what ... said people that were eyewitnesses what Mr America they weren't even interview [laughter] but I just want to take you to that room for a second\nUh the whole process was to me again I'm a what's considered a young senator here ah for just five years but I just never saw anything like we were shuttled and there were about a dozen Democratic senators and our first shift we were given an hour\nTo go through the papers they literally only had one copy so we were reading together and you go to folks playing rumble Ridley very conservative Democrats all the way to more liberal or progressive Democrats\nCook so that's Cory Booker here's a Bob Corker from Tennessee\nThere's absolutely zero co-op or a cooperation with zero cooperation to any of these are allegations are obviously it makes people feel really good coming out of there Kirk\nZero cooperation or the or the Democrats are saying that there's all sorts of stuff in the FBI report and stuff that they should have a track down but didn't\n[noise] they don't want anybody to believe that it's a legitimate FBI reports of what they're going to go I don't know what they had to investigate but not on the side I guess\nThey say that they should have interviewed her and they should have interviewed Brett Kavanaugh\nOr you just got to listen to him for\nWhat else are you going to\nCook when you were you surprised about Heidi Heitkamp she's a senator from North Dakota she voted in favor of Gorsuch and she'd behind by double digits in her race in a state that Trump carried overwhelmingly and I thought she was going to be a yes vote but she voted no\n[noise] actually followed the party line I guess she's writing off or you know I really don't know there are cracks were almost two man it was only one democratic voting for him to correct\nIt looked like Joe Manchin will but here's what Heidi Heitkamp said Joe Manchin from ah West Virginia\nBut the one thing that I learned from that experience was really that the most important thing you can tell a victim\nIf you in fact do is that you believe them and I believe I'm a doctor for I Believe her story and I think it is critically important that the message gets sent to women and girls and and people across this country\nThat um when you believe that ... that you should sad and and that that begins that process have really exploring and revealing I'm a ... the changes that we need to make in this society and I know that's\nYou know a lot of people would say well you know this has been exaggerated I think that if you really sit down with most women ... even in the state of North Dakota and talk to them many have personally been victims\nOr they know someone who's been a victim or they have a daughter or a a granddaughter who has been victimized by sexual assault and and I think that\nMy my belief that a doctor port is telling the truth\nLeads me to the conclusion that I have to vote no on judge Kavanaugh\nKirk [noise]\n[noise] I don't think you're helping women caused by you know with the ... just tell the story and you don't need any coup unique proof or anything you straight and if you really want to make a dent in this you got it right away to\nGet women to go to the courts the police\nAnd go with evidence and let's get this spring showers you can say something and they have no proof pirated 'cause you're not going to get anywhere anyway and are you going to have a bunch of people are mad which you have to have some type of immigration Kirk\nOrrin Hatch a like a Senator Flake was surrounded by a woman in the in the halls and he told them to to ah to grow up here and Don Lemon on CNN responded here's what Orrin Hatch that\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nOn\n\nWomen [noise]\nAnd here's what Don limits\nThe butler and asked them to grow up\nYou seem to think that um we forget about\nThe about Vietnam and the protests then and how people got into their elected officials face as we forget about the civil rights movement when that happened we forget about the women's movement when that happens we forget about the stone wall and the gay movement when that happens and all we forget about the Iraq War that the most recent Iraq War when that happened\nAnd people got into the faces of their leaders that\nIs part of a democracy and that's what makes us America so I say shame on those lawmakers for speaking to those women like that they should encourage them to dialogue and maybe the engaged them in a conversation and listen they wouldn't\nHave to cook this battle of this confirmation is like Vietnam it's like the civil rights movement and it's like the gay rights movement really\nMind when she might be a little bit closer than many blacks or getting along and showing up in a little or no\nYou don't record gesture courts and stuff all eat anything they wanted to believe so that's why they want to take us to I guess that's why they're going but [noise]\nIf they can do I like this over winters right what's next\nHere's what happened with Marco Rubio\n[noise] how are we going to offer based on the\nWay\nI'm going to be going on we want to go out that way you know they're all different this procedure has been going well [noise] health and touches on an issue very obviously very important in the country\nAnd and he needs to be handled in an appropriate because there's a single shred of cooperating\nOn the way how how should have been the gathering\nOf information I mean if we make decisions based on information or were you when I interviewed over a hundred and fifty people over two decades\nA single one of the cooperative any of this has there been a single shred of cooperation I'd be the first one out there I'm Still reading through the documents\nHad more time\nTo do it again I I just don't know anybody in America that's had over a hundred and fifty people ask questions about 'em over Twenty years in a single one is raised cooperate in any of this and so we have to operate based on that but I'm not done reading the documents okay\nDid you get a chance to read Brett Kavanaugh's op ed in New York Times uh no I didn't\nKnow he said the basically apologized for ah for the outburst for a saying that this is a revenge and the Clintons is about the left are trying to upset an election he said he's never been more angry or that's not me or ask anybody I'm I I'm an independent or a temperate judging and so forth\nFormation um have put their their their their thoughts and this one sexual advances next one's going to be either faith based\nUm or maybe because she's a heterosexual I don't know what what's going to be coming up next\nWe'll Joshua ... all I Know is this it doesn't matter the this this list that I'm the president put out during the campaign is the attitude that has it has women on it and believe me they would be just as vigorous against or whoever that person would be a as a war against Brett Kavanaugh do I remember when I'm\nA ...
