[noise] I Know everybody is talking\nESPN and I'm Glad you guys have a media blackout everybody's talking Oh yes yeah now of course the game was going to be or how good\nSpending more than a quarterback and how you betcha back or or just wouldn't want to go on to play but I mean again the dominant tonight and every facet of the game and then\nAgain they brought in three weeks four three two weeks and I have\nA large come back out here and put everything the\nOf us to make it better and better every week you know they don't want\nWant to be the greatest quarterback every ... every week we see him do something better and get better on the\n... it just seems like you're right it just makes it makes a step toward\nEach and every week and tonight rages we were sitting up here in Washington you know from the food that you saw it lives down there on the sideline those out throws it they noticed those aren't routine out through those those are those that you see on the next level\nYeah and the first of all it's just going back to the coverage you know I\nI Believe again taking roles on all these guys have got reputation right now because if you saw the coverage is Frenchman coverage ... they were failing so in the back of their minds we\nCan get beat by his great wide receiver for those guys were built the whole time and that's open up the al ... and all that goes up so again\nThese guys came to play a put all the talk of rats about who's the best office and all that so again since he was getting better every week we saw something always sleep on the news every\nWeek when there's ... as far as uh guys coming in every day and then going back to a hindrance and toss it I mean Jim coming into the game and\nMaking a a a almost like a player come off the bench or certain basketball these guys came in and made it impacted\nAnytime you can travel as guys were doing ... experience like this young because of the hands again you're going to see something and do everything because she knew I'd go out there and have felt that the soldiers forever whenever you guys ready to come out and play every week and then have somebody new stepmother may play\nWell and obviously defensively now coach vegetables [noise] had a great game plan of work for this thing and he has deep into guys I mean really that the first ... use when\nAll of a sudden it's it's it's a second down in Nineteen that Denise set the tone for the rest of this game after that\nYeah and I'm proud of near the night like you said the whole secondary that came to this again we talk about uh last year we've been able to finish the contest the ball has great wide receivers and they say that today\n... news ended up or you know a a defending the guy and\nPassing a parent's calls you love your show again that just goes to show you mentioned these guys are growing region and we got it and\nGive it gives them the opposite line because they got to block you know for all this rather passing you know obviously they had been running at the last several games there's still there's no full rushing touched down by the way\nIn this game and Eighteen on his three and Dick's on his one was never touch going into the ...\nWhich is crazy like I said yeah you see something early last week about rush for we got three guys that rush for over a hundred yards at three we didn't have a hundred yard Russia this game but again we're able to put the ball and travel often hands able additional route and we come up with all of a forty one of those seven victories which again\nAll classes or the game I think closure is simply [noise] but you have to show up every every Saturday and play like your you know zero zero and\nThe coaches ever done an amazing job like I said like you guys ready as evidence and like I said the preparation usually here's agrees come out here and it's actually the game plan and you know never skip a beat so somebody that you know\nBring your a game every week you got debris because if you don't have you been seeing game somebody's going to knock you out nobody knocked off\nI mean we've seen it All right I've got a job rather will see in Tallahassee next week I Believe your doctor well there you go Reggie Mary weather on the sidelines today's game presented by founders federal credit union guns in athletics would like to thank founders federal credit union for their support of the clubs and tigers and they just send your your\nThoughts on what we what we saw this is as dominating performers are obviously as we've seen really it's I I think\nIn some ways more dominant than it was in Winston Salem two weeks ago because this was all the hype all the build up all the little ... shattering talk in clubs you seen that in and made I mean they were it was all about business\nToday yeah when I was impressed with though is Glenn should show and the ability to take with the defense gives right I mean you we we rented a ball terrific uh get two hundred and eighty yards rushing a game\nAnd so in the state decided well we're going to make the freshman quarterback beat us well he did do for a three hundred and eight yards\nOr so or ... you know didn't get a hundred yards rushing use it as a team but uh they're going to give you those out cuts to play a man a man a Trevor more than a\nThat he was a terrific it that the ability and Higgins ah had a great game a catches for a hundred in uh Nineteen yard and uh and then the defense or you know that was the other aspect of this game that they I think we only had one sec [noise] but
