of the changes that Twitter has been experimenting with a more subtle now um the company says it they're adding a status indicator so that users can see whether or not someone is active on line or what they're doing a great [laughter]\nI thought all this time at least I could hide with Twitter I could just read a few things and nobody really knows I'm there but a wonderful book and hopefully they'll at least come up with another option for you to hike 'cause I think Facebook allows you to do that you can hide your online status or something so maybe it would allow you to do\nThat you can only hide it if you don't want to see anyone else's rights that right oh\nSo if you don't care who else is on then you can hide yourself yeah or or just not log on at all\nYeah but they also say they're testing color coded conversation so that users see tweets from people they follow in a different color making it easier to follow more popular conversations well that's racist\nI think

I'd like you to ask that do you think is that a fundamental transformation do you think is good\nI mean it should get your kid of college that one if they were why you've conservative so do you think the odds are they'll say what's wrong with it that's the odds are they will probably say what's so bad about\nWho needs a father\n\nThat's I I Believe that you that if you have a kid on the left of college and you cited this statistic forty percent of American Kids are born to parents who are born to a mother who is not marry they will say so what\n\nThese are just old fashioned patriarchal values that kids need a father or need a mother who's married to a man or let alone to the one who helped conceive them\n\nBut you go as an example maybe I'll do are rare tweet on that has a good

Prager show interesting experience five dealerships car dealerships the LA area and\nThe experience was essentially the same in each it makes such an impact\nOn on my on me and my wife or just be correct English on my wife and me that I actually have written my Tuesday column\nComes out tomorrow or on on this subject\nWalked among the things that most go to me was the lack of knowledge about cars that they're selling among these all all of them young mostly males\n\nAnd the uh the end of the last hour I raised the the uh an interesting question\nAnd now that you can call in and I can pursue it I I had this experience with my wife was shopping for an SUV first time I've always just driven a car\nAnd anyway shopping from SUV and I am very rarely shop for cars because for much of my the last decades I have been driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they they sold their businesses in any way whatever it is it now as we're having a new experience to\nHaving had in a while ago or even car dealers him I don't want to give car dealers the business I Want to do it by Internet or want to know what to do with the you know with car dealers [noise]\nLet me give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's not an issue there almost all young men with whom I took test drugs I think in every instance of five I think for four or five five young men\nBut the thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean ... any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no ... I'll look it up oh let me let me just looked at him\n\nSo as I said at the end I think that if this is an old representative and it may not be like fully acknowledge that but if it isn't all representative\n\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered because hey I could look it up\nWhy why do I have to know if that is you can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the lines of the of that SUV versus the other one it's like ... or I could always look it up and the other is in general knowledge may not be valued\nWhy do you need to know anything if you could just pull out a little smartphones from your pocket and find out all you need to know\n\nThis is now if you feel that my general generalization is not valid or you do a very curious\nTo hear from you because it made a real impact on us I Am trusting of at the lines are working one ape Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n[noise]\nThat was a that was one\n\nAspect of the experience that hit me there was another one too which is even deeper\nThan that is that the there was a there seemed to be an absence of passion I\nAgain I remember from years ago when I when I last really went looking for cars with dealers the the the sales folks were passionate about cars that's why they were in that profession\nI didn't have that sense from any of these ah salespeople\nTo again all the young I didn't have any sense of that but they were passionate about cars\nIt was it was they might as well have been working in a shoe store this is not negative these were very nice people ... ... ... not a character challenge it's just a statement of a change that\nYou know if you haven't seen anybody you know in a war you ever seen a young person a long time wow boy did you grow up you really grown because you haven't seen them see you see if you haven't seen something of a long time you can see a change\nSo this was a change that we saw a gentleman do you uh when we protested technical question our our launch working is what does this story showing that you know\nOkay All right anyway uh\n[noise] we'll find out they're not working you know what I'm Sorry folks I hate giving you wrong information I was given the information that all the lines are up about okay\nThese are unfortunate things that I must admit it ... me but you gotta live with it and you gotta live with it and that's the way it works that's what I saw though there was it was in it and then I translated that into as well\nThey there didn't seem ... in\nIn young people and I'm specifically addressing men whether they their ambitious enough and I wonder too if in this generation\nWe have in some ways it created a less ambitious\nYoung male oh I have\nTheories on that but let me go now to my guest my looking forward to talking to Jones me rock senior editor of the stream the co author of the excellent politically incorrect guy to immigration\nAnd John I was reading your article today and it is or if she begins with so many valid points you make more valid points in a paragraph that most people do in the book\nThank you but it's ... dot org why people to be able to find it okay\nOkay I was given the wrong in ...

Soto\nWas told I thought\nThis out and he said if you enforce property rights for the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from thugs and from ... drug lords Latin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence of it they were fleeing to America\nAnd we have a huge welfare magnet a lot of these people you know they they come in and start working their kids will grow up properly I public assistance large percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away\nRefugees get a get a honey pot full of benefits from the government and you know why the Catholic my own Catholic churches so gung ho about this refugee armada\nForty percent of the U.S Catholic bishops income\nComes from the U.S government from programs just certain immigrants forty percent is government contracts\nAnd one out of four five Catholics in America is now an immigrant mostly from Latin America because our bishops had been walling in these scandals and running ... gay bath house is labeled a seminary so one out of four five one out of four American Catholics has left the church\nI'm Sorry not one out of four four out of ten for Catholics born in America can leave the church and the only way to replace them without reforming the church is to bring in more cannon fodder for Latin America which also brings in hundreds of millions of dollars from the federal government\nYou are made a point to me last time and it it it just shook me up because it makes so much sense if you can feel the church with Americans you have to bring in non Americans\nWho will last or maybe ten or Twenty years and then they'll get disgusted and they will join a Protestant Church because they don't want to have get bishops bug ... seminarians they don't want to have its way she is that many priests who have boyfriends they they don't want the child abuse running or aunt that [noise]\nUm by the way are just true for people's about what you are a Catholic will be back in a moment you are listening to the dentist Prager show\nThis is gonna happen presumably right before the incredibly important congressional elections right and I I I I worry given the butter bias of the media that we will just have video after video and\nPhoto after photo of some American either military person or ice person or a border guard of pushing some mom with a baby\nAnd then uh it's it's it seems to me when the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and then suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets in at at George Soros funded attorney\nNo that's not to forgive me John that's not the propaganda war that's winning the war I agree but the propaganda war you know I may I say ... let me let me just break his point\nIt seems to me that they win if they get in and they win if they don't get it and\nI don't because if they are good I Hope you're right I just know those folks I pray you're right\nI think if Trump shows weakness if he caves then Republicans across the country we just our hearts saying we realized the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status\nIf even Donald Trump can't say no to something this ludicrous and politically cooked up\nThen we're we're toast and I think that would depress turnout\nLine I I agree with you I agree with you I just I I agree with you I Do I think if he danced farm if he's yes if you remember that\nThat will mean in picture in pictorial form that they will be fights between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us because I think people see that this is an invasion they can see it the people who are going to cry because a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back\nThose people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out for for its war otherwise going to turn out this is a national impeachment referendum the less bases all ready fanatical they've got their\nTheir ... ready they're ready to go to the poll they've got their dead people registered to vote but left is all ready at its maximum frenzy and hysteria they've maxed out\nWhat the Kavanaugh hearings did was wake up the Republican base a wake up the patriotic Americans to say wait a minute they're just they're threatening our system of government that destroying an orange adjusted oh and now they're bringing in\nTo transform country demographically by the thousands and thousands and thousands know\nFrom your mouth to God's Ears will be back home and joins Mirren Z.

a parallel between the Catholic bishops and the leaders of the Democratic party and that's not just that they're often cousins of each other because they're just Irish Democrats eat and pointy hats or not and pointing at\nI'm In both cases they've given up on on the on the people who are already here the Democrats have given up on the black community\nThey've given up on large parts of the Latino community they just want to win port new voters across the border who will take the place of the of the blacks and Hispanics who are walking away from the Democratic party staying home or even voting Republican because of the failed Democrat policies\nIn exactly the same way the Catholic bishops have utterly failed in their job as stewards and it and apostles every last one of them with one or two exceptions should resign and get a job at the post office where I hear they're pretty good pensions\nAnd um that it's in each case they've decided they're unhappy with the people they're supposed to

were minorities eight percent military age man\nAnd then they just they're giving money on helping in housing them once they get here some nefarious conspiracy by them they're being manipulated I was sitting there five years ago four years ago my mother's church where she's been going for decades I'm not going to end the name of it\nDoesn't go there anymore and it was like we're going to take an offering for the bill and Melinda Gates foundation now is they're helping children get vaccinated and right and and oh we're going to help some migrants and it was just like all that's all they are now it was about to stretch I mean that's all that goes on now okay\nAnd she went she was going to get to talk about the point is the point is is they use all these well meaning people incrementally until they've got you literally pushing the global is agenda\nBecause they take over your religion so I Do not believe that people send a God you know were hating America and thought that they were like we have to go out and do the deed we have to go out and bring these people I went through this but the global as are manipulating for Bob saints and so there's white supremacy went back and he believed official story you know he's sitting here looking at all this believing all this\nAnd and and and then he says oh my God look at ... finally we've got three of who's doing something they are bringing in these illegal alien invaders blah blah blah and then he goes and does this horrible day of the time as I said last Monday it we've got the clip you\nPlayed last week I had some business guy here\nOn Monday that one of them come in and he said I was there and your studio watching Monday when you said they're probably have a crazy guy in a van with a bunch of Trump stickers all over it until bust he goes how does you know that I just said man come on\nIt was fourteen days out now or nine days out and it's going to get crazier if they're on every news channels saying there is about to be giant terror attacks and the Trump Alex Jones is the free press are to blame\nHey we never knew that be we have no history of it she the left there's been talk constantly staging banks and calling for violence and showing it magically all again you got to look at it a little little battle the corner on go man that really is convenient and why would you know these attacks are coming and be parroting it up there over\nAnd over again but let's go to parents as I mentioned oh I guess Fox News can't suspend this video I guess they can't ...

I feel sorry for who were just desperate for their Social Security check and it just scared and then you go to a ... and man it's like the best looking black people the best looking white people the

and attacking\nThat footage is up on him for wars dot com is very very sad and these people look like they're idiots\nI mean you you contrast those black folks versus a video of black folks it properly talking to me and\nThey're all more articulate than I Am better dress than I Am that their act together and then you look at these leftist victims and they literally act like morals and that's what I'm telling us the global dumped on education bank people depending because they want this type of climate\nDo you have the band Lou Dobbs piece from Fox News that reared Saturday and they're all apologizing everything it's pure truth uh from judicial watch should not the documents proving for us is in part\nDepending on which ... and you look at ... about thirty percent of it was your taxpayer money the big thing at forest gets taxpayer money it's not that he's a criminal\nThat that's a side issue that really scared of is for us aid to the un he get your money and he directed that way they can the un too much crime ... they don't get in trouble but I sense it through shore oh so that's coming up but\nThen I bring this about left us acting like zombies and make almost all white because they are\nAnd it's important to let go\nYou know it it's like when you see somebody\nI don't watch a lot of TV but we watch sometimes a lot of talk shows they have a friday and Saturday Night you know when they're about my wife is from those on my daughter's in there you know the ice cream or whatever or else it's just like I think this happened to the point of this because last week and they have like a lot of talk shows and I go oh those are methods\nThat can be blocked that can be why they got the mass amounts they got there aren't that all I got the cops are going to find measure than there are in and their birth and every time I met this found the parts I mean it's like you look at a left this and they look like methods\nOr something something's wrong with\nI don't care of their white I don't care of their black I don't care who they are there's something wrong with him\nWas he the studies that conservatives look better all over the world that can be Brazil or can be an Africa it can be a you know and it caught another country conservative look better they're not really conservative that the media means what is successful looks back\nAnd it's not just that you look good in that you're looked for classical is that you have an innate strength in\nI mean how many videos that we see in the left beating up people are pro life demonstrations men beating women in the media prices but\nBut I digress\nLet's go ahead and get to them blaming Trump for everything here is shift the corrupt member of Congress the Democrat deputy head of his shirt committee sharing that crop is guilty for the climate of of of what she's quote here\nTrump is guilty ... the tone of hatred and ... I mean\nOf more conservative calling for violence encounter up on one hand\nThe slightest white supremacist was a national socialist that hated dropping because he likes Israel and and and and ... you know it just so that doesn't say it for\nFor having to just blame the media and alternative media tried to ban that 'cause they need a scapegoat\nBut the left itself all the violence the shootings ... attacking Rand Paul on on on and then all the talk of killing ... and raping barren and write thing millennia and raping blah blah blah all the stuff we hear\nAnd then they say Trump is responsible for standing up to him was responsible for here it is\nUm the broader issue is what kind of crime or climate are we creating in the country this country is filled with amazing beautiful wonderful people who came here many of them I'm attracted by the idea this was a land of opportunity nobody loves the engineer ethic\nMS Thirteen or God's Children you may you may not like on vetted kids being ... Washington Post but Obama brought in loaded on God Knows who's charity disappearing forever\nAnd to prop has added to this the UN wants to run the borders not let us have any borders ... says we're ... we're not all of the un anymore and so you go on there and say he's responsible that climate that you know you've been pushing continually content\nOr junior color that ideas being tested or by those who are preaching hatred and division um and we have to overcome that a Democrat or pretend I think the president has a pivotal role there no one sets the tone more than ... when the United states\nAnd the tone that he says one of division off and one of hatred or sometimes one of incitement to violence against journalists are and there's no escaping\nOr collective responsibility but there's no escaping the tone as he sets for the call that's an odd costs\nHave gone to the the tone that there should be a country what you'd call white supremacy he says we deserve a country and it shouldn't be run by China or the UN\nOr the bureaucrats which we were under he killed the TPP all them I mean that is the president says\nFake news big guy okay let's go to the next clip here this is

you know talking to the locals what you think's coming because you're smart cookie\nWell you know I just want to say something on the situation where the media is trying to blame a gab somehow because this person use their social media network\nUm it's just not logical the last like had a double standard most of the shooters and bombers of past Kerry events all had various social media accounts on Twitter and Facebook and so on and so forth\nAnd yet these social media accounts or social media platforms weren't blamed so now they're trying to use to justify blaming gab AI holding them responsible for something that they actually are as\nUnderneath section two thirty communications decency act\nWhich these social media platforms are open neutral public forum has\nUm protections in so they aren't liable for something somebody necessarily says now the different story if they were actually plotting it on social media but there's no indication that this individual is planning it rather than they were just using the platform to say I'm Free speech which there in the case was very anti Semitic and very big it is\nNow I Want to point this out many of the people that we talk to and they were standing around that were residents of this neighborhood\nFor the tree of life synagogue that recently was shot\nUp with a mass shooting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nUm these people said hey you know if there had been armed security there\nWe could have been minimized the casualties there could have been less loss of life and that was one of the interesting things that sparked up following this is that you had many members of this Jewish community talking about whether or not they should have\nHad guns to protect themselves given that there are a lot of anti Semitic capable people out there that we target the Jewish community we know that Hitler\nWho is the biggest Jew hater along all\nKnew how important it was to disarm people that you wanted to kill a we know the Hitler took the guns prior to\nShipping off all these innocent Jewish people to concentration camps and then exterminate them\nSo any people's any group of people the Jewish people have been persecuted very much so that they saw the importance of having that right to protect themselves and that was what kind of instantly sparked at in the neighborhood now of course you're going to have your liberal there\nYou know that they believe that more gun control is the answer but a large amount of the community there was orthodox Jewish people that are more conservative leaning like\nFor example like hell bent Shapiro is um a lot of them share more conservative people and we had an interesting interviews with them and hopefully we can get around playing some of those clips Alix\nWhile we're at a time basically now but we're going to have those tomorrow during the week I show they're all posted the info wars dot com\nTo those wars dot com and the only way any of this key stuff you're saying is if listeners again get excited have that chain reaction\nTelephone for the local stations are listening and washing or spread the word about enforce dot com on these wars dot com and get these articles out because it is amazing and what you're covering ... uh is is is\nNot in the mainstream if you the right wing or left wing it's not just America wanting common sense but listen\nWe predicted the shooting ... liberal facilities we predicted the bombings the the left kept saying it's coming it's coming before the election with no proof now what's happening I don't know exactly what's going on but it's a very very suspicious the whole thing and I really am cringing belly and the next eight days\nOr before the election of what they're going to pull\nOh yeah I mean who knows what's next we know that during\nOctober surprise season anything's possible on one thing I Will say that very interesting that did actually creep up into a on a mainstream media site on Facebook CBS was streaming and there was an interview with one of the CBS reporter who was there she interviewed former president of the tree of life than a dog\nAnd he was talking about how they were actually anticipating an event like this and that they were working with the city of Pittsburgh emergency management plenty people and talking about how they can better mitigate a shooter take\nOn a show that a month ago they had all much prettier and I'm\nThe porn liberal I mean I really feel sorry for him carry concealed carry have guns you got a synagogue\nOr whatever you better have guns in Israel the synagogues have guns and your target for ... you can't call nine one one and wait five minutes God the cops Dr fast and then an engaging like five minutes but people were dead by their show just to protect yourself good lord\nAnd there are some synagogues in the area according to some of the residents they do actually our lives\nAre so like most of them do notice there's got to target that very suspicious we should look into this guy because I'm worried about liberals doing false flags they figure out where to get us now is to create a memo about themselves on line and do something that hate America so much that\nThey would go stake somebody synagogue about the Jewish vote but the but this guy there's this whole thing is ...\nWaiver will be tracking at all I Know you're going to
