R. Hawkins from Breitbart News followed by a four hour with Dr John Lott\nWho I Know is frustrated and I I spoke with him today but I Can't wait to bring you the program today [noise] excuse me a bear with me I Am getting over a cold and I don't want to keep reaching back behind me to the board hitting mute so if you hear me every once in a clear my real bear with me I Do apologize but I got I got to start the day off we start the hour off with you here today\nWith this I got a phone call this morning\nFrom on my studio I generally don't ever answered the phone I don't even know the number but it was ringing incessantly and continue drink so I decided I pick it up and tell a telemarketer where to go when I heard at a mock this is Mike ... LDC British radio how you did I\nAnd I am doing just fine Mike how are you just wonder if you might be able to join Kevin McGuire with us\nOn the radio today in about Fifteen minutes so I did and there is a big article that I just found the moments ago Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter now this guy you know anything about\nThe McGuire Kevin ... is a long time political a journalist pungent and radio hosts very well respected in England he's also so far left he's ready to fall off the planet\nThere is a clip here that's attached I Want you to take a listen to what I have to do is give you a theater of the mind\nBecause you can't see Kevin the clip is a video of him on the air with me he's letting me talk and the whole time he's rolling his eyes you tough in his ... his shirts coming off drawing and shoulders back\n[laughter] and after about eight to ten minutes of being on the air with him in my complete thorough utter destruction of him I Want to read you a quote from the bottom from one of the readers of this piece of cyclists and see how I did hear how to do\nIf I can get the pop up here I Hope I can here we go can I Do it I might not be able to do it well we'll have to maybe pull that off in the later segment here or maybe another and another thing we'll see if I give me one more shot on this I just pulled the ... minutes ago so it's possible I might not be able to get a Toronto but we're going to try it again\nA background check looks at the background it doesn't look forward Kevin and that's the problem that we have these people I I can lift off thirty mass shooters in America who all past background checks we can do what we want to the problem is there are guns in American as Paul said if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun\nCan in America and that's what it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very very complex issue as I said there are hundreds of millions of firearms in this country are you a response was\nBan assault weapons well first of all I bought my first a are Fifteen during the Clinton assault weapons ban there are tens of millions of these guys in America that aren't going anywhere so it's wishful thinking it's easy to see jerk reaction say my God we have to band is\nIn reality that's not going to work because\nThey can't be bad they are all ready here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their lawfully own firearms who have done nothing wrong with their firearms and that's the vast majority of this complex and it's frustrating and I feel your frustration as an American gun owner we hate to see those were the ones that will just stop\nWell we don't the case for people murdering people and saying\nThe fifth of Americans with guns or intimidating the the full fifth I Do not I don't know I don't want your phone or any more I don't want your thoughts and prayers any more than ...\nNow he went ahead and got does ... liberals do he lost the argument he got very ... and he cut off my Mike\nNote was excuse me it was an awful lot of fun but I Want you to take a listen to a comment at the bottom of the article and we're going to go to my first guest\nAnd this was promoting Martin Palmer's another you interview was longer than that one minute and forty second clip but he was completely utterly destroyed this Kevin ... is Kevin Maguire is an MBA so in a route ignorant one of that the American was polite courteous and gracious throughout you have to present or got so angry after thoroughly losing the argument\nThat he swam down the phone and went into a tirade behind his back\nSo apparently after he hung up on me he went off on me on the air and that's fine I couldn't care less what losers do\nIt made me ashamed to be from the same country I Am disgusted by this present or by the way what on earth as American gun laws have to do with us here in the u._k. shouldn't we just bought out it isn't like the u._k. is such a fantastic place crime is through the roof and there were more murders in London last year the New York\nLet me go directly to Alan ... founder of the second amendment foundation and have some fun with this as we move into other topics with you today Alan how're you\nFind like that that like if I find it a little little exchange there\nWas a lot of fun and for somebody like you who has a has a lot of experience and you know people coming after you and you know these interviews are going to be set up I've I've been on with with them with a Kevin in the past so I knew what was coming you know it was interesting how he before he interviewed me\nHe interviewed a gentleman by the name of Paul with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette who absolutely nailed and said essentially kind of what I said\nBut he talked about more of the complexities of the issue he went deeper into why it's impossible why gun control laws don't work et cetera Kevin McGuire never set a thing to him never questioned him when he came after me because he had me on before and he knows I'm armed American radio and not a journalist with the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nSo he you know he tried to attack me but he got put in place and I thought the comment from the uh from the reader of the article in Britain today was wonderful and I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nWell I think he did a marvelous job uh unfortunately you're not going to change his mind or probably as a matter of his viewers because his viewers of people just like him otherwise they wouldn't be viewing\nUh but you did a very good job and you know that's the expected ... getting at at a a left wing of course it will Britain a delight people control I mean they like to control people it's just a problem as a Brittany\nThen it gets into the criminals anymore so running wild\nYeah and they were the he doesn't like to talk about crime in Britain and so forth but now Piers Morgan put a tweet out the other day too I found this fascinating Pittsburgh shooters reporter to using they are seeing the preferred weapon of choice for most mass shooters in America Sandy Hook Vegas et cetera not talking about will be your letter to tell us that that's not true\nBecause they kill lots of people very fast this is what they look like and he posted a photograph of us will people scary or repeating and he says I ask again why the ... are these legal for civilians and my reply was quite simple\nBecause tens of millions of responsibly armed Americans use them safely and responsibly every single day\nNow how much of this argument now are we going to start seeing because of Pittsburgh I Want your thoughts now on how you think this whole thing is going to build up over the coming days and weeks ... by the mid term\nWell before I answer that I'd like to point out that this particular murderer didn't just having a A R and you also had handguns with them as well [noise] uh and we don't know what what what can you actually used to do all the firing their how many drug it was like bullets from which guns so when they go like to pick on the assault weapon you know if your band it's all up as has got to walk into an\nUnarmed unprotected you know I you know synagogue our nobody had a firearm to protect themselves because of their country policy uh and if he didn't use the R I couldn't eat probably did uses handguns anyway\nSo the problem here is is that none of this works and they just don't want to admit to it now and answering your question how it's going to play out there's no doubt that he pulled his gun rights and prohibition lobbyist could do everything they can try and spin it you know the evil of guns Cleta Mitchell election\nUh there's just there are two ways about it I'm not sure and back and people are going to buy it because I think the American people just play ... recognized attack it was a hate crime a coup committed against people of religion\nOr that it took a crazy crazy person to do this it was a you know obviously a murder that they didn't have a A R R as Hank as you could walk in with\nA pipe bomb as well and and kill more people so the problem here is is that it isn't about guns and the American people get it so I'm not too concerned about how it's going to impact Mitchell elections\nI I'm with you on that in fact I'm with you on that a hundred and ten percent\nAt some things you can feel in your gut listener union I Know you know this you get that feeling I I'm not getting that gut feeling I've learned over many years in business and\nAnd just doing this that you you learn to trust your gut my gut instinct is generally always right at least ... percent of the time now and I'm kind of feeling the same thing you know I'd like to point out that people would have\nHad I had the opportunity before he not hung up on me because he was destroyed and couldn't argue with me any more but\nIt's the fact that uh for example when we show in Virginia Tech used a glock Nineteen and twenty two to murder thirty two people and they don't want to hear that because they're okay with handguns and when you get on with that they really get mad and pick their toys that alone as well in like in the beginning\nAnd in Britain and then I don't care tank and see that's why they trained them so let's be honest about it but ... but again with what I think\nReinforces a our feelings is going to be an impact near term elections as a recent Gallup poll that came out and that was an all time low of American people wanting to ban a are fifteens\nOr well I I just I'll just renew my membership next year and not worry about that what concerns me about that and I know the honorary wants to keep that happy face on we all do but there comes a time when you got to say look guys\nOkay these people are out spend enough now three to one and we need to get off our dust we've got to get active yes we have grass roots but we need assistance here and let's go now to sixteen thirty nine you covered enough of it but I just want to ask you one question as we're coming up to this ballot initiative\nThat six hundred thousand I'm just going to say this from what I just heard you say\nYou felt better last week and you did this week is that first statement\n[noise] oh yeah that that money to compete with that certainly thousand dollars I I I feel as good as they did last week I don't feel good with that last bit of money coming in from three big donors Goldberg being one of those and\nYou know one of the problems we have is we want to put a good spin on everything but you sometimes you can't believe you're on ... ah and sometimes it it it's better to let people know who they are the battle you know I always say that are done lightly what election away from extinction and it's really true\nIt absolutely is true and it's true every single election cycle it every single election cycle All right let me move to another topic with your quick we've got just a couple of minutes s a F joins California group suing riverside county sheriff overseas cw policies\nThis is not the first rodeo with the second amendment foundation supporting the rights of a legal American resident tell us about this one real quick\nWell this is a share of its decided 'cause California Guinness is may issue says chairs get discretion and what they want to do you say that if you're a legal you know resident who holds a gun you know in in Sacramento a lo and behold you you you can't you know in reverse I can actually say you you can't get a permit to carry it for self protection\nOr we want to stick his all across the country will win this suit as well and the sheriff or he pretends to be a pro gun but he he hardly is permits out in ... in this county and or is it really tough reelection battle right now\nSo let's go probably ... eat good chance to lose the election and the new chef coming in will move to suit for us and we'll win all because those are issuing these permits or we'll go to ... for the finish the court battle and loves the court overturned it\nShares Stanley Smith a sniff is actually pro gun\nHe's pro his gun he's just not pro\nYour gun hopefully all of that comes true out I'm so sorry we ran out of time I could keep your delivery I were you know that thank you sir for everything you do we couldn't be doing any of this without you

and did you do want to kind of a underscored to all of you\nThat the way we're able to kind of can put this together for that totally live broadcasts that have these discussions\nOr is not off the Web you know it sounds like you've got to have a lot of a ... a base of information\nTo be able to to have the updated discussions that go along with the news of the day involving Israel and I have a lot of knowledge behind that to be able to just jump right in and discuss the Saudi Arabia is a roller Russian role or raw lead role in these regions of the world\nAnd of course ultimately our own interest as the United states government so James I really appreciate that we're going to talk politics or it in this final segment as well\nAs people get are are already voting are preparing to vote as the midterm elections are officially eight days away that count down the river back fifty days away sixty something there's ways just eight days away down\nThere was a lot of because of what's happened uh the the the uncertainties around that that those are those devices that were being sent last week and that personal it's really big captured thankfully that situation no would get a get your but then that horrendous attack\nSaturday in Pittsburgh there's not as much focus really the last two days\nOn what's going on in the mid term elections sometimes with the President Duterte rally there's been a renewed focus and then the news goes back to uh what else is happening but we're only eight days out now so I Want to get people's thoughts on that one hundred sixty four thirty wanted Joseph calling from New York all my one just welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nHey Joseph I chose to say that up here in New York and New Jersey Republican ... bad situation because of his satisfaction with the tax cut the\nSide of the people were yeah explain that to a similar audience just because they may be surprised if you just said that people were would be dissatisfied with tax cuts\nSo the satisfy the tax cuts that any little class homo actually going to see a big tax increase to the nation of ... other states pay tax\nIs the focus again on the rights that was one of the focus it I can explain this ... this is how you get into these issues that are affected is why I appreciate these phone calls\nWants to affect the races that we may not all these things just national issues permit for the tax cuts were coming through\nThere was this idea that blue states where the ... you had much heavier property taxes\nAnd you were able to you but you know right that offer you no longer able to do that to to the the numbers you were able to do it doesn't affect people and a lot of the I'd say more moderate states or red states but in the blue as the blue states are these state these huge state bureaucracies\nWould tax we'd have these massive taxes that they they would expect people to be able to kind of say it could have been from the ... through their federal taxes but you talked about how this will impact specifically this New York congressional races\nAnd I looked down at just real real clear politics with the toss ups just in New York New Jersey and\nI ... up there for their uh right down the costs of category that's that are critical to how the house of representatives ultimately whether he remains Republican or not um and then if you look at leading one way or the other or you can add another uh three are actually other five\nSeats in New York and New Jersey that are up\nJust in the house of representatives so I Do believe it's important that we get updates on especially as we we will continue to talk politics\nAs we move into a ... it's a just eight days away that everything is not about a national issue or the big kind of got a big picture issues that that's politics is local to an extent as well as it sometimes you see that even more so\nI'm Out out in the congressional race in a house race the specific region and it may not get as much pickup nationally as the big issues about you know economy but what are the sub issues on that or tax cuts for what are the sub issues or on to that\nAnd how it affects how people will vote in that you've also got the you know they like this issue of the caravan\nThere are people talking about this all over the country I mean we're talking about it's all of all of you listening now that includes people who are calling from upstate New York\nUm and people were calling on our southern border and everybody else in between you know for ... and so so those who are directly affected it ... by the individuals who would be making their cross\nAnd then the whole country how it's affected as well take it was this or or department of homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen updating on and I want to remind people who's been an increase now and the amount of troops authorized ... eight hundred to five thousand\nOr there will be along the border prepared for this\nAs a still the hope is to work with Mexico or to prevent a ... there's a massive wave of individuals are from coming to our border and then having to be process takes it was\n... and will continue to fall certainly and what what I had to fall apart and getting in\nThere is a legal way to answer that I have\nA key to answer illegally and we'll be down here we are working with our partners will accept how can I ask for a way for their territory I can ensure an orderly flow and that they had no legal rights ... there are any of it when the phone\nThe idea that again gives the issue a hairy ultimately does the United states implement the law that like Mexico should be as well\nOr if you are someone actually that is if you were actually someone who who should\nWho is making illegitimate asylum claim you're supposed to make that claim the first place you're safe first place basically outside your home country so long as you're safe there what we're seeing is oftentimes this cases people say the Mexican government
