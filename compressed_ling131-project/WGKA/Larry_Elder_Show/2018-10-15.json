American radios monster broadcast\nThe week of ten for team let's get started as I'm sitting here setting up and then a man into an individual walked up to me and did basically the same thing I was just telling you about asked me a question about the cards that we're setting up the computer and the be portable remote studio and I shook his paw and he introduced himself to me as\nCombat Vietnam

and I've asked marketed that we've not met before have we know what you are Arizona citizens defensively if that makes us brothers\nAnd I'm a life member and you say you've been a member now for about two and a half years\nAnd is your first stop let's go with a combat veteran you began telling your story fascinating I asked you to sit down and I appreciate it if you tell listeners stormed American radio on two hundred plus radio stations around the country right now your story how'd you get here to easy the deal mark\nI served in Vietnam for the United States Navy reverse supply bowed out of the deep water port of denying our mission was to bring supplies to the troops in way and dog on a perfume and Fabio reverse [noise]\nGoing up and down those rivers getting shot at it with shrapnel\nFiring our weapons throwing grenades we needed to do that because the troops needed their supplies and you could not send the soldier out [noise] the army and Marine Corps out without their supplies and we were carrying their supplies from the deep water port up to nine\nHours in way during the Tet Offensive I lost three guys from my riverboat and they were good guys villain Larry were Twenty one and Mike was Twenty years old how old were you mark I was twenty young kid I'm fifty years now I just got back fifty years ago I just got back from Vietnam [noise] I'll tell you I Know what you mean by that but I Want you to explain that\nMy guys didn't die in vain our children our grandchildren freedom and liberty are worth dying for and [noise] we're losing that concept here in America we're losing it um [noise]\nI'm gonna get deep here for just a second as okay we've never met so I'm going to do anything you want me asking you questions at that\nYou know if I'm if you're uncomfortable let me know but I don't think you will be no that's why you're sitting here ... you made a comment across the table right before I ask you to come on that made me say hey man get over here\nAnd have the what'd you joined me for segment and that was the comment that you made was they won't let you tell your story in schools right today this is a very dangerous time in America today I think you'll agree with me we're watching very harsh rhetoric come at us from the last threatening violence from what are\nWidely regarded as Democrat leaders we've heard him from Hillary Clinton she can't be civil with us\nWe've heard it from Eric Holder no I don't consider Eric Holder a leader of the Democrat Party I consider him a loud mouth opportunists who will do and say whatever he has to do to stay in front of a camera because he apparently has political aspirations [noise] but he says when we go low\nThey're supposed to kick us [noise] you've got a story to tell\nBut my ... different ... explain that\nGod chooses the color of our skin and God she uses it for a man or woman and God chooses our parents or brothers or sisters and God chooses the nation we are born and and I don't judge judge choices had makes no sense to me\nAnd it takes the race card right off the table well they don't the liberals don't want to hear that sentence until simple sense well they don't want to hear that sentence because it it wipes out part of their agenda takes got out of the equation by it takes\nThe race card off the table it takes a whole lot of things I Try and teach the kids just look at God's work just look at their work how perfect the world is and where we are yeah come\nAmazing book how beautiful display yes this is the most beautiful places in America and there's more loving the world and there is hey\nWhat you would never know that if you were just watching TV or if you were turning on the quote unquote news or if your head was buried in the quote unquote media and I've been teaching people for years to try to get their head out of this garbage and go out and live their lives and look around where they are and see what they see because guess what happens when you do that\nAll of a sudden you find out more people think like me then I'm told all day long it's not as bad as being told all day long I really am mainstream isn't that right\nThat's what you need to understand [noise] your purpose in your place in the world and if you can't see God's work who who will look at yours well we'll look at your work nothing happens in this world by itself you know the political left will never push us that way they're trying to terrorists down there trying to keep us from because they want to destroy freedom in America\nBecause socialism is their goal has been part of their agenda they've been quiet about it this has been building for decades yes but here's the lesson from Vietnam that they don't speak about the great lesson from Vietnam was\nThe communists were supplying the north Vietnamese with everything that could to defeat us and they realized they couldn't beat America through our military couldn't do it but they saw the weakness at home\nWe elected bimbos ... as our leaders and they were the ones that lost that war wasn't Oregon so it was a happens is now here's of the the concept the communists learned that they need they could destroy America from within by supporting these\nIdiots propaganda that we elect alright now let me let me stop you for a second because you're going deep I could keep you for three hours but we have other believe me I really could I Do it's an honor to sit here and talk with you\nBut the propaganda that we're talking about is what you're talking about they can beat us from within and they did it during the Vietnam War you know that first who English there now that's where I Want to go with you know you're seeing that regenerate aren't you\nBecause the God the United states has a covenant with God\nThat people don't speak about and the covenant is we're supposed to be the greatest nation economically militarily and spiritually so powerful so strong that\nOur enemies with our in our shadow and the world would be a safer place\nWell thank God for Donald Trump he's making us stronger and you're not you watch Ninety two percent negative coverage and in today's day and age what again with how do I get to see how do how do we get to ... and my job I Believe my mission was to get to those many high schools as I couldn't speak to his many young people as I could to give them the basic\nHow great America really is how successful are you getting in those schools ...\nI've been doing it for Eighteen years now and and the beginning I got that tend to twelve thousand kids a year now I'm looking to make a thousand hits y because the liberals have taken over our educational system the liberals have taken over our colleges and universities are high schools we can't I Can't get into\nAny so let me again there's always method to my madness where when I asked these questions you and you'll know what road I'm going down I Know you will [noise]\nWe've known liberals have been infiltrating our systems are our culture our our movies are films are just about everything music now Taylor Swift run in her mouth\nAs far as I'm concerned just shut up and play music and stop alienating half of America same thing with LeBron James Robert De Niro I Can't even watch Goodfellas anymore because of Robert Deniro so we've seen this coming what you were just talking about for quite some time\nThis is my question is is Democrat Republican it's an honor to sit here and talk with the man who's been through what you went through in defense of this nation talking about losing friends of yours that twenty Twenty one years old what Democrat what American wouldn't want you talking to our kids about what is part of our history\nI just want them to here's my line to these kids after you explain what their freedom cost how children used in Vietnam\nHow um [noise] given you have to explain the price of freedom then I my question to them as we are going to give your freedom to\nGive it to drugs Alcohol Tobacco having a baby too young jail socialism or you can keep it for yourself dramas like judo solicited okay now today oh but it's not out trying to explain to them\nThat I Would like them to keep their freedom for themselves and what they have to do to do that is just study the declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights just understand what it says I have a cold or the Bible and\nRead what is trying to teach you just don't understand it pretty much in a while but isn't it stuck up suddenly that\nI use the Bible or write the conflict which I have a copy of the constitution within arm's length of me right now we've got one on your personal sure I Need to get back to that in America\nBut do you think you know at least he's on a path that he wants to take our guns away of his mind\nI Can't stay on the guy I make no bones about that every year I think I I find the irony in Michael Bloomberg to be absolutely hilarious if it weren't so dangerous because of the money that he's capable of spending I use this analogy [noise]\nThis is a guy who wants to take away sugar sodas wants to keep eating bad foods right you're shaking your head also is to actually control you but you know he's running as a Democrat he was a ... a Republican now he's an independent see this as a guy that has no conviction but don't you find it ironic he stands up on the podium at the New York hot dog eating contest every year\nWhile he wants to take away all you know things that cause obesity while he's introducing when he was mayor anyway well he's introducing folks are going to ... shutdown sixty\nFive hotdogs in ten minutes you know the whole irony of this thing gets me and so what's what's difficult it's a guy go it's a typical rich guy who sings because he made so much money\nHe's so much smarter than everybody else all they did was smarter he was smart enough to make more money that's all it was well he gave up the guns that surround him when he was not never he won't give up anything the security I bet you his security at his house is far greater than most people\nYou've got an army at is how they can afford it\nBut things because these that smart Martin and everybody we've got about a fallacy of the the the left we've got about a valley so you're a Democrat we've got about a minute tonia regularly to armed American radio listeners and tell them why it's so important\nThat they stand up and be heard and fight for these rights carry a weapon and when you can carry it in an open\nArea carrying an open area so that everybody can see that um\nDoes guns around and that the bad guys can see you it's not about the good guys and you know and it's about the bad guys seeing how many guns are out there and they got to rethink how they're\nGoing to be ... I'm trying they're evil and that's the deal the guns in the way and it's supposed to be because good people need to carry them more good people\nMarked on maestro it was a real pleasure meeting you I was a tie on me and I'm Glad I had the opportunity God works in mysterious ways there was a reason you were across the table oh yeah when we were going to the segment I had planned on going directly to Mr got leaving opening this program but guess what where I couldn't I Can't think of a better way to have started it\nWhere we bring somebody in here who are you know I I can say\nYou got a real ... you got skin in this game\nBrother oh boy do I do right yeah I still have my stomach stressed that I'm dealing with in a war doesn't go away you said that it's been ... years and years and you feel you're just left Vietnam I just got home and last month I got home that\nIn a while it's it's really something and it's um as if it was this morning\nAnd I think believe I Believe that post

about the situation turkey has to be updated people on pastor Brunson is\nA situation but I wanted to get a your thoughts on his release your nose administer seeing him Neal and prejudice just your reaction to those that twenty four hours of of a release of from uh what was the house arrest in Turkey after a year and a half in prison or more of the year and a half from prison\nAnd uh you know stopping over in Germany at the military base than landing at joint base Andrews which you are based in and then um and then being in the oval office with depression United States can prepare for the president\nYou know pressure Brunson a spiritual in personal integrity or was really on display in and not in a bragging we on his part\nBut when he prayed for the president and then just this whole demeanor his attitude he very quickly said that he gave his captors and the officials in Turkey who not only arrested in under false pretenses but they miss treated him part of the time he was there and just say that he gave them immediately was a powerful\nPowerful witness that in addition to him praying for the president in the oval office it shows the the the real a character of the man himself yeah I wanted\nTo make sure you all had a chance to hear from everybody in our team who had been working on this combination of this to the radio broadcast or to get ... what's his comment on that and with pastor Brunson but coming back or to be on the air with us live tomorrow\nOr on Jay Sekulow alive must be right to the phones a lot of calls coming up politics will go to Michael's called to that because Michael who I was one of those folks who I city are you actually getting involved with the campaign the at the headquarters you volunteer and Michael ah you're doing just that I give us an update\nBut I just want to let your kids\nExcuse me know that um you know the hell are as those uh last friday he was a ... you know I had not that much ahead but he was still ahead and there's a lot of young\nPeople after a young Republicans getting out there and and you know getting the word out on the street to get out and vote so I just want to let let everybody know that it's not just us older guys any more it is a young people that are that are out there now\nOh you know I Will tell you as soon as worked on a number of campaigns young people play a very important role that grassroots efforts of the campaigns are not taking away from any of our anybody older but you know knock it on neighborhood doors a it takes a lot of time and energy if you're out in Nevada and the heat or\nYou could imagine or in other places where it could be cold\nUm is somewhere between uh you know a hills\nI listen to they they they fire up campaigns young people and that is important that you you see that kind of enthusiasm around a candidate is that everything grass grab a grassroots plays a very important role in midterm elections and saying that race in Nevada is key\nYou know the Nevada race Jordan as we talked about that is one of the races the Democrats absolutely have to win if they want to be the majority in the United States Senate and that race like many of the others\nAre has moved decidedly in Dean Heller direction I think if you look back a couple of months ago I think you would have probably prefer to be Jacky Rosen in that race I think right now you prefer to be a Dean Heller and has followed the national trend that we've seen but uh during the common I Would make about that raises if Democrats don't win that seat\nThey won't be in the majority in the United States Senate that's ...\nYeah I mean let me let me go to west west you you you know your thoughts just as the it seems like the mood has changed me\nYes one of that is the president's back on the campaign trail and doing what he does best which is a those rallies and they are now happening you know eat almost every day or or or even sometimes too and one day and it will continue to ramp up we've heard from a the\nA White House aren't so you've made clear the president will continue to be on the road even today surveying the damage it forties do his job as commander in chief is with pastor Brunson on\nA Saturday but it was back at a campaign rally or you know the a following that show that he is he is out there um it does seem like there's been just a shift I I and I don't just say that because I\nI'm a conservative it just it just seems like ... with the cabinet or what happened there everything's just started changing ... going the opposite direction for Democrats who were on the uptick you least electorally\nAbsolutely they were producing a blue wave and I think many people you know are believed it I certainly was concerned that they might be right but here's the thing Jordan the American people by and large or a decent and kind people\nAnd the political climate has changed and it's been so ugly you mentioned ... ... you know justice Kevin all that happened to him look at recent statements by Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton\nAnd Elizabeth Warren are that are really mean spirited kinds of things and I think the American people are turned off from that and when they see these kinds of things going on not only does it energized the GOP based to get out and vote which needs to happen but it moves independent voters also\nIn the name of decency and kindness which is the value of most Americans it moves them also to vote for the Republican candidate that the Democrats really I think are looping when they ought to be running because of their own miscalculations\nThey're ignoring the values and the concerns I Believe that the average American or middle America in southern America and I think is going to come back to to bite them and the midterm elections is a real possibility of that but to answer your question is the political climate and the ugliness\nThat is on the one hand turning off American people but on the other hand energizing them in the midterms to go out and vote\nThe following this been ready to DC for politically correct tend to dismiss learn so it doesn't say Larry Elder [noise]\n...\nLarry over here the

there aren't more ... administration we talking about that later on as well and Hillary says that Bill Clinton should not have stepped down over the Monica Lewinsky scandal why won't Monica Lewinsky

nights every once in a two for three but first with Warren says that she took a DNA test and according to the Boston Globe the DNA test found quote strong evidence close quote a warrant Native American ancestry going back to six to ten\nGenerations you have very very special people you were here long before any of us were here\nAlthough we have the representative in Congress who they say it was you're a long time ago they called her Pocahontas but you know what\nI like you know because you are special your special people you are really incredible people and I'll have to from the heart\nNow the Cherokee Nation has responded to reports are the result of orange DNA test and what the Cherokee Nation said it was quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship\nCurrent DNA test not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship\nAnd while DNA tests can be used the term in lineage such as paternity to an individual is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any other tribal nations even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong it makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses\nWhile also disarming legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and his heritage is proven Senator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continual claims of tribal heritage into quote\nIs I guess people get complacent with just one of the presidents have now two years later we have an election so they're complacent and then we always went in the next one which is as you know the presidential election\nThen as I see those ... days

an skeptical\nAnd said that the percentage of Native American blood in her is quote a far cry from any reasonable threshold to embrace minority status for job political but that's exactly what Warren
