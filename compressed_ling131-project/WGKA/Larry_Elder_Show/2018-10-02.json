H. G. E. D. triple late nights and the ones that are too for three Larry Elder released after dot com studio what is the actual number of illegal aliens in this country a new study puts the number is substantially higher than most people believe [noise]\nAnd the next segment we're going to talk to California Republican candidate\nFor governor John Cox new poll shows that the repeal of the gas tax Republicans assume [noise] would be popular it measure to repeal it turns out the repeal is not popular the majority of California's want to keep the gas tax which increased the gas tax and also vehicle registration fees\nIn order to pay for infrastructure [noise]\nAll that's coming up from the late nights have been one S. A. G. E. end Kanye West went on Saturday Night live and when the show was over before the studio audience went on a rant about the welfare state house destabilized families and that Ninety percent of the media is left wing [noise]\nI thought it was at a seat pac convention [noise] all that and more now before\nThe for Kavanaugh hearings where for Nader accusations and Kevin responded sixty nine percent of Republicans supported Kavanaugh's nomination to the court thirty two percent of the general public supported it\nNow [noise]\nWhen Ford testify but before Kevin responded listen to this panel headed up by Clinton apple is\nPeople are watching this all across the country has just began\nThat's a tax refund saying she looks like every woman you know she says she and she does uh she is just someone\nWho keep in mind this pan always before Kevin all testified but after four did\nCompletely recognizable to everybody in the country ah we we know women just like her and uh and she's certainly doesn't seem to be somebody with an agenda as she is putting herself in this very difficult position\nI it's a very odd hearing and uh the difference between the Democrats and Republicans has been very striking that her persona I think has come off as so far is highly credible\nI've examined hundreds of witnesses on the witness than she is extremely credible she is extremely detail oriented they're a little things about what she has said\nLike the fact that she has two front doors can't make that stuff up it is so unusual that sort of detail it makes her testimony extremely credible and the fact that also that she said\nI Am terrified to be here I don't want to be here but I feel that this is my civic duty I I found her to be one of the most credible witnesses I think I've seen\nIt in Georgia have to say it is unmistakable here how how clunky it is the transition between the Republicans on this committee to the Democrats you talked about\nRachel Mitchell there who's been brought in by the Republican so that they would not have to question Dr Christine Blasey Ford or a ... capital when he appears 'em before us here later today a foot that transition back and forth has been um bumpy if you will but what has not been bumpy as sort of a temperature\nIn tone in that room from the woman who was answering the questions Dr Christine Blasey Ford obviously up to the American people at home to make up their own minds about the veracity of what she's saying\nWhat she has been very consistent George\nAgain that's an ABC panel led by George ... after Dr ... four testified before Brett Kavanaugh did me well on CNN Simone Sanders said this about Kevin\nWhat I don't believe that cat and I told the entire too I'm just the part that he noted about the yearbook entry but we call the young woman to run that are run out of the alumni because she was one of that but she didn't know that I just thought it was unbelievable I think he he he told nonchalant by lied about things I don't think he needed to lie about that perhaps he thought that that he\nCould not get any ground um because he didn't want to be found cup or anything I had the most I think the thing that I understand that you had been if you believe you have not done something wrong and you add that and you angry but the way he portrayed himself at the outset of the hearing today um he looked on hand\nUnhinged so based upon that reaction based upon the reaction by the ABC panel one would think that even Republicans might have gotten wobbly on Brett Kavanaugh contrary known for I mentioned that before the Ford Kevin hearings sixty nine percent of Republicans supported his nomination to the Supreme Court\nAfter the for Kavanaugh hearing\nThe figure rose to Seventy five percent meanwhile forty six percent of Republicans said they will be angry as opposed to be disappointed if Kavanaugh is rejected\nNow as far as the public at large is concern before the for Kavanaugh hearings as I mentioned thirty two percent of voters favorite Kavanaugh's nomination now thirty seven thirty seven percent favorite now in thirty percent opposed it now thirty seven percent of post\nSo it's appeared to scour the general public on Kavanaugh but not on Republicans Republicans have anything to again Lindsey Graham has warned that if this is the new norm watch out for your nominees guys\nThe polygraph and they didn't tell us until September twenty six and deal with this what's in front of a guy who adamantly\nDoes is everybody who actually knows him in a real way say this is not the guy I Know I got Dr Ford\nWho can't tell me the time in the place and we'll see what happens to be some ... or a up until now for some Republicans not so this is my Republican colleagues if this becomes a new standard for you have an accusation for weeks\nYou drop it right before the hearing you withhold from the committee a chance\nTo do this in a a professional timely fashion me one day publically say\nThat their goal is to lay the boat get the Senate back in twenty eight teams to make sure he can't fill the seat they're publicly saying that I don't want to reward that kind of behavior I think we've been very fair and to my Republican colleagues if you can ignore everything in this record [noise] looking at allegation is thirty\nFive years old this uncertain time place date and\nNo cooperation if that's enough for you God help us all as Republicans this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends if this is the new norm\nYou better watch out for your nominate\nAnd why senator Ronald that women should not only be listened to they should be believed to she told me to shut up and do the right thing for a change to that Lindsey Graham said this survey regret\nThank you I Know I'm a a single white male from South Carolina and I told I should shut up but I Will not shut up if that's okay because I got here the same way everybody else did the people in South Carolina voted for me and centers got to be their voice than women\nAnd I'm gonna try to be their voice today and uh maybe not just for South Carolina but a little bit about what I think is going on here\n[noise] enjoyed her over at the view in mid season form\nDo not want to investigate this any further [noise] they just want to hold on for that power they know that this country is getting darker\nWhite Europeans are now sixty one percent compromise darker him out I mean they want but not white Caucasian race card capital twenty forty five ... the forty nine percent towards going down so it's almost like they they worry that white people are gonna lose all their power so that they don't care if\nShe's ... she's not lying he's like they just want to hold on to me that's how I just sound will they like South Africa apartheid which ten fat white people who are running the country [noise]\nWhat he's like they just want to hold onto that how how does sound will they like South Africa apartheid repent that fat white\nPeople were running the country it seems like that's the trajectory that we're on me the trajectory ... on going all over again\nDid we not just aware and re elect\nBlack man for president Abilene, Texas the town\nWith a population over one hundred thousand that voted the most for President Trump eighty percent just elected a black guy for mayor\nHow's that haven't\nSeven hundred counties voted for Obama in two thousand two thousand twelve two hundred of those seven hundred switch the truck in two thousand sixteen did their racism just go in remission for eight years\n\nThe reason Trump got elected as because white people are afraid to countries becoming increasingly brown [noise]\nIsn't it\n[noise] racist [noise]\nI Am white so I

trying to get the the state to approve a a legal injection sites where addicts and showed up in a nice clean environment which I think is it's certainly are ridiculous and it's not going to solve the problem of the horrendous drug addiction that's afflicting California\nJohn Cox when are you going to debate your opponent\nNext Monday\nAt ten am on a public radio station he doesn't want to face me across a table on live television Larry I mean he's afraid that Mike good luck\nSo just overwhelmed [laughter] uh yeah\nBut really it's really actually a a looked like such a youngster next to them a a which is good and I promise not to use his youth and inexperience against\nThem John Cox speaking of of good looks he he is a a good looking guy and I and and I'm thinking maybe that's why you been

California looking like San Francisco does these days I mean you need a roadmap to avoid the feces on the sidewalk so\nYou know I don't think Mr newsrooms answers for California or anywhere near what

I Want to thank you guys\nFor everything you do as far as researching fighting and filing for all Americans regardless of party affiliation we appreciate that thank you Jay be like my question is okay though they've taken out and that was one vote\nLiking him well but lately or can the nuclear option ...\nAlready has been so so there's only a majority vote is no super majorities anymore I mean I uh I I Will not to get into a long debate on this had happened with a Judge Gorsuch is called is that here he was he would have not been confirmed a without this occurring so so you only need fifty one votes\nAnd really out of the senators you just the fifty because the vice president can vote\nAnd as a tired or or he could be that fifty first vote so um\nWe're already there there's a super majority necessary I Want that just clear to everybody is you need a\nA just a a normal majority vote\nAnd the vice president can be the tie breaker so\nA ... but it it's just the way that the city worst right now the patches together say people talk about I I don't like doing it by the way it's like the sexist way we're we're cascade college like just because they're women they're going to vote this way if they are two of I'd say they are the two most moderate members\nOf the U.S Senate who ... who are Republican\nUh and uh it just like his kind of\nMoved over to that world over overtime but certainly towards\nHis retirement so I we don't just talk about it because they're always you know this the cast to save vote ... it's because uh they have kind of cast themselves together\nIn this situation and allowed it to happen so that's why I think it it would be weird to be saying to see one of the vote one way and one of the other even though they've they represented very different states Maine and Alaska\nIt would be strange Jordan they typically vote together and actually early in this nomination process they were pretty much get public comments that they thought\nThey would be voting together along with a couple of the Democrats I Do think maybe it's changed a little bit now Jordan because\nUh look I don't think that mansion and high camp are going to deliver you the deciding vote so I actually don't think the vice presidents boats going to be needed here because let's say you do get two of those three Republicans and you get to fifty votes and it becomes clear that Brett Kavanaugh has been going to be confirmed I think at that point senator mansion in sin\nI Would probably vote yes especially center hiking she's down ... points in North Dakota and more than sixty percent of North Dakota and support the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so it's it's weird how the politics work but once you get to fifty I think you're actually going to get to fifty two or fifty three\nAll right so I mean I get we're trying to explain it all for you when this vote occurs which we expect the earliest would be\nThis week at a so it'd be a Saturday vote which is interesting too because the American people's attention is usually not as focused on the news and Washington\nOn weekends all of that has impacts of this people because they're worried about you know a who's watching it ... it with is watching but but again very important to note Kelly in Wyoming online five Kelly welcome to Jay sexual alive\n[noise] hello [laughter] Hi Kevin for taking my call I just want to say as somebody who is fifty eight and has been watching and an active participant in politics\nAnd it wasn't and I don't find and I didn't find that testimony as Ford credible at all and I I just\nI think that McConnell will take a vote and I hope he does so that that senators will have to be on record\nWell I think that that you know that's the important point Kelly and will be a political calculation\nAh to make I mean this is going to have been terms I think very quickly and then we could go round the horse but I think we all agree there's a calculation they're off\nDo you have a vote foresee the senators to be on the record or even if Brett Kavanaugh goes down or so is it the last ... can be used positively\nUh for the Republican Party to say see this is what happens now if it's Republicans doing it I mean it becomes a little bit more complicated right I mean so I think that ... that is a political calculation\nThat Mitch McConnell along with the White House wants to make it I think that's a changing\nA potential to I don't think that you could say today on Tuesday that that that if it was going to be likely vote down\nThat it occurs that sometimes you got to go for it uh but and you got to hold people speak to the fire let me get right back to the folks that want to get through so many of these calls ... hold on marketing to brass on line six this if you want to do want to go around the horn on bart welcome to chase you alive\nI um I thought of another question but I was on hold and first as the American bar association a western drawing their support of of a judge Kavanaugh not\nFully but they wanted an FBI investigate and I think the president wrote a letter saying that so the actual it'd be a of a position is still qualify so that it's all it's gotten a little burst here um but that being said we're kind of ... yeah we talked about these phases before\nWe're past those phases now I mean we're we're past the really the the phase is the city has given us back to the FBI the FBI will they'd give this this is not about judicial philosophy anymore that's about how you get caught up even as a judge on the bench\nThis is private life mostly focused on college years even high school years I mean Harry that the truth is that a BA ready they did pull that stuck on Brett Kavanaugh to try it didn't even make a lot of news 'cause the what was breaking were so salacious says the FBI they said five will do in the background check\nIf the American bar association has any confidence it has competence with respect to a judge Kavanaugh's qualification is educational background\nHis temperament on the bench\nAnd he passed a bad analysis with flying colors\nBy\nLarry over here the said from South syndrome as a unit ... runs the program the credit and allow because he's got a country to St Louis guaranteed\nThroughout\n\nSub go\nLook for the late night seven one eight gee triple a nine to one to four three very over here will effect dot com studio next segment talked to attorney Larry claiming claiming the founder of additional watch I think he's representing virtually every one of the accusers of Bill Clinton except for one [noise]\nShe conducted a number of deposition [noise]\nAnd he knows all about the role that George Clinton outlets played in helping to orchestrate these so called nuts or slug strategy that was used to malign women like dinner for flowers was called a saloon singer Paula Jones drag hundred dollar through a trailer park no telling what you're going to get [noise]\n\nWe need to ... to ... she was raped by Bill Clinton and two weeks after the alleged rape [noise] was written by Hillary\nWe're going to talk to very claiming about the role that Mr Clinton not let's play because\nOf the sanctimonious way he interviewed Sarah Sanders and ... not to bring up his behavior during the Clinton years\nAt let's let him tell his side of the story before we allow allegations to determine his entire\nFuture does seem that the president has already reached a judgment about their stories and there does seem to be a pattern hair when Roy Moore is accused from Bill O'Reilly is accused when Roger ales is accused when Rob Porter is accused and that one's Kevin always accuse the president consistently every single time\nTakes the side of the math you\nKnow it's interesting that you say that it's a lot of Democrats that like to ignore Keith Ellison and Cory Booker they love to fight and champion women until they disagree with the U.S how Frank and lost his job in the Senate\nAs I said Sara had too much class to mention Mr putting up the behavior back in Nineteen Ninety two let's revisit\nThe government has a character problem but I take it the jury loaded open has okay reliable cataract as its own well let me he is\nNot denied that he is engaged in Myrtle infidelity is not as soon as he had problems and is that right and he uh he has talked about the draft and to some people it's a character brother\nBill Clinton's passes character test throughout his life and throughout this campaign and he's two senators commitments to real fights and what isn't doing this campaign is focused on the court and the American people on the jobs and the education that's what the American people care about they want to move into the future they don't want to be diverted by side issues they're not going to let the Republican attack machine divert\nThat was then and this is now\nA number of other Democrats should have the same type of scrutiny look the president is a question every single time the president is taking the side of the man against women users that's not true\nIsn't that an amazingly annoying can we go back again Nineteen Ninety two George Clinton apple is what is named interest I can send your facts with names addresses phone numbers of a unit affair with this is from the documentary war room he's talking to a reporter who's calling him about an allegation that Bill Clinton had an affair\n[noise] it wouldn't make a truce it is completely\nIf he went on the radio\nAnd said the Clinton is the father villages child he would be laughed at would think to create I guarantee you that if you do this and other working democratic politics you\nKnow you're talking to a reporter and you're saying if you report this you'll never worked in democratic politics again what does reporter doing working in democratic politics is crazy\nI guarantee you that if you do this in other words and that was called ...\nSo you are threatening the people that do what you do right now isn't it ironic\nThat we don't want to say a matter of you will be embarrassed for the national people will think one of my very healthy will believe you\nThis is again George ... novelist Nineteen Ninety two threatening a reporter who had apparently a story on Bill Clinton was Governor Bill Clinton\nAnd people think is\nIs that the alternative is they don't do it that causes some temporary have people who tomorrow I'm going to matter and you have a campaign\nTo understand in a difficult time did something right but I Do not go on\nAnd that was then this is now\nAnd in this case the president knows Brett Kavanaugh he's heard his story there hasn't been a shred of evidence to corroborate the other individuals story and there has been a lot of individuals that have come forward and talked about the brake having all that they know a and they're confident that these things didn't have a final question what is the president ...\nAll right\nJulie sweating it because the one who claim she observed a cabin up dissipating in a gang rape or being near a gang rape or she said she herself so she was victimized but can't say whether or not a Kevin I was one of those who assaulted her\nCan you tell me what happened what is your comfortable telling us\nWhat happened to me is probably the most horrendous awful thing that could happen any human being my body was violated [noise] my soul was broken a I with not able to have somebody stop when I said no stop [noise]\nYou buy I felt like somebody took me and basically said you're worthless there's\nNothing to us you are disposable I was at a party and I remember that I started not to feel very well and next thing I Know I was shoved into a room and I'm having my clothes torn in\nDifferent directions um I was touched everywhere uh I was physically assaulted in every way you could possibly physically assault a woman it was horrible\nI had no way to fend them off\nYou know what I'm going to ask everyone is wondering if one of those people with Brett Kavanaugh [noise] I\nCannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me but before\nThis happened to me at that party I saw Brett Kavanaugh there I saw mark judge there and they were hanging about the area where I started to feel disoriented and we're the room was and where the other boys were hanging out\nAnd laughing I could share them laughing and laughing and it's very hard for me to talk about that but it's important that somebody said something because if Brett Kavanaugh was one of those people that did this to me there is no way in the world\nThat he should go Scott Free on this and that he should be on the Supreme Court he just I\nJust think about ... if he does I there's no justice in the world\nShe said that she saw him standing by the door\nMost are the punch containers I don't know what he did but I saw him by them yes\nIn her declaration sweat Nick also wrote I also witnessed efforts by mark judge Brett Kavanaugh and others to
