E. triple eight nine seven one seven to for three very elderly factor dot com studio not been telling you about my next guest for four months he wrote a piece almost eleven years ago called race to the top\nWhich appeared in the American spectator we have it up on Larry Elder dot com he's a senior fellow at the London Center for policy research please welcome to the program Jay harm to Jay\nWe haven't we haven't talked in years nice to talk to you\nYes yes that that was back when we were both young fellows that's right now you're what does that make it would be a now where where are you station or you are you in London\nWell the London Center for policy research is named after Dr Herbert London who's the head of the center so everyone a the kind of people I Want to fool into thinking I'm In London I don't correct them [laughter]\nWhat Jane when we talk years ago we talked about this article that I that I mentioned called race to the top that you wrote\nA in January of two thousand six for the American spectator and you're told about an incident a political meeting that you went to with your dad tell us about it [noise]\nWell this was a formative and a transformative moment for me a\nLot of fun my political engagement that I was just a fly on the wall essentially I was a six to seven to something like that [noise] ah my father got invited to this meeting it wasn't that politically active but he was a prominent figure\nAnd this was in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn [noise] ah and they do think Charles Schumer to us and I think this is before\nHe ran for Congress is what it was becoming a a state assembly person [laughter]\nSo um they were introduced here and they were trying to sell them to us he was not a very impressive figure I must say it was a whiny a nasal uh didn't seem to have much confidence and they were trying to put forward\nAnd and sell them on the basis and unfortunately the the all the assumptions that went into this horrible but they put forward on the basis that he's going to get the blacks or if if and UK if you know the flap but section\nIt tends to be a white section of a single family homes and for whatever reason over the years it evolved in that way but there's a cluster of apartment houses on ... avenue cave where blacks reside in [noise]\nAnd frankly they were there were not violent there was it wasn't any kind of like the one oh classes going on in the streets or there was no fear it ... if there was a problem I didn't detect that problem I Lived there but to go ever had a problem with it or would only been on a strictly racist type of basis\nAnd uh\nSo they brought showed us they say this guy's a genius he's got a plan to get the blacks are fairly new K\nReally as you're going to do it well as what he's going to do so he's going to make some kind of a state funded refurbishing of those buildings so on paper to look like he's helping to buy\nAnd but of course they can't refurbish it with the people living there so the mood to people or to other locations\nAnd while they refer to it then the turn into a type of a a co-op units where you have to buy your way back in\nThere was suing that most of those people would not have the funds necessary to buy back and and so by then they would already maybe took would take a year or two for the construction there will be settled in the new area anyway they wouldn't bother to come back and then\nThere would sell these apartments so white people and that would be the solution so here is the man who is Korea was launched\nOn a racist premise of manipulation of political power to achieve racist as absolutely disgusting\nNow Jay this a Chuck Schumer he was not in office he was running for New Yorkers simply at the time\nAs I ... to the bathroom my recollection of it I see I I'm not positive on the day so I'd have to go back in his career it was either a is it seems most logical to me that we didn't know him at all you see it would have been running for state assembly\nNow he stood up how many people were were at this meeting roughly\nA you know it's not the kind of thing you say in front of a large crowd it was you know ten twelve people who uh had some ... ... and ... I guess it was a a sort of assumptions that you could you know talk this kind of inside baseball ... I mean I was very very uncomfortable with what a what a lot of\nThe promises that went into this whole uh you know interaction I mean there was an assumption that of course you want to get rid of the blacks\nAnd that this young Harvard educated you know with that but it's going to come up with a great solution had accomplished that it was awful\nAnd it was Schumer is planned the one that you just outlined about relocating them on the basis of these are going to be refurbished and then they get right at first refusal they wouldn't be able to to a forward to pay for it and voila they would be gone this was Schumer outlining this plan\nRight that's ... yeah and they were selling them to say look what a genius he came up with a strategy would have thought of this is this is a massive stroke\nMhm now this plan never gotten implemented or do you know why not\nWell they do get in for months and then that they do they're refurbishing but uh they underestimated the capacity of the people to move back they they were able to raise the father came back most of them and there's pretty much the neighborhood is the same as always been except that\nUh the blacks ended up with with better housing which was up to the good but that was not the intent is\nWhat is your father think of this plan well my father was not really that political figure and uh and I didn't\nReally discuss it with him I was a teenager and to me it was is revolting mhm so\nUm why did you take so long before writing about it she were sixteen years old but you didn't write about that was a kid\nAt the time but that but that's really what got me motivated to politics at all the years as I was getting engaged and as a writer I used to write for the Jewish magazines that eventually a broad and into the Washington DC magazines and I was working my way up the ladder so to speak I always wanted to tell my story\nAnd in fact in Nineteen Ninety six I was a there was a fellow named Robert L Virgo who's running against sure for Congress\nAnd I actually went to apply to become his campaign manager and like you know who you are like ... you come from as you don't understand I this man is\nIs ah you know even personified or if I could do I think to bring 'em down I was so\nSo of course uh the local Republicans I never heard of me at the time and I and I didn't get the job but [noise] but uh so just to show you how passionate I was about that and I would also particularly offensive because he was the congressmen for a very orthodox Jewish section in New York [noise]\nUh he would go around and and pans it to them or talk a little year this stuff like that and then he would take their votes these are really holy wonderful people and he would use their votes for all the evil society demise of all it could show was the most reliable vote for Bush is anything\nAny type of thing that that involves\nA you know undermining right traditional society is the most reliable vote and his power came from or sex juice with people who who is ... where we were\nPutting Jay's article up on Larry on the dot com race to the top by Jay Honda Jay thank you very much for coming on maybe this time somebody will finally asked Chuck Schumer about this change coming on\nThe and I really appreciate it always a plus you\nGot it and now Schumer is blasting Kevin off for lacking the appropriate demeanor of a judge what kind of demeanor did you show when you were pushing that race and plan to get rid of blacks sir\nIf you say well maybe he's telling the truth and maybe he's not he doesn't belong on the Supreme Court\nAnd I think most Americans are saying that\nAgain even if you want to discount as some people do what happens when he was Fifteen in high school\nAnd Eighteen in college\nAnd how were you when you propose that racist scheme that Jay on that just spoke about [noise]\nTana ... what he is saying and protesting at age fifty three\nHey if you were a racist in Nineteen Seventy four you're probably a racism twenty Eighteen right\nWhen it flies in the face being truthful unbelievable\nThe key question here their demeanor you shorten show the demeanor of a judge at the hearing there is partisanship\nBrought out\nThe most raw form of partisanship so on becoming of someone on the district court\nFederal appeals court let alone the Supreme Court\nAnd he did not show\nAny semblance\nTo always be a hundred per cent honest untruthful which is what we need in a Supreme Court justice\nNow this week that the FBI supposed to take the Democrats really want it to be wrapped up in a week [noise] we're talking about that Renee in Little Rock Arkansas wants to weigh in on Mr Schumer Renee please don't leave town and yesterday I asked you a couple of

Jim\n... guys dream job when you Jason say the eighties right remember a little trouble here\nYou should do you want to be the speaker phone\nGoing I'm not I had had jumped off that's okay um you know bottom line I guess I'm probably going to vote but if if uh uh just judge Kavanaugh does not get concerned um it just kind of goes to Jordan's point that\nHe hasn't said this I'm going to say this is my self it's the Republicans as the majority of ... I mean what's the point of voting and Republicans is again another\nChurch I get I get the feeling what we've been kind of getting rid of those Republican Jeff Flake is on the way out so I think there's a good there's actually a case you can make gym to get out there and vote because the Jeff Flake types or on the way out the the uh\nCoworker who is there on this issue but those types of decided not to not to be there still so I'm I'm not going to say spineless farmers say the more moderate wing has been leaving so this is the time to fill those those agencies so that's what I mean we're not talking about most of the Republicans\nWere talking about a handful one who is who we could replace actually potentially with a much more conservative person ... you know I think there's anything\nWell I think Jordan is correct I think most Republicans have been extremely strong with respect to this particular nominee we're only talking about three Republicans at the most\nUm and I think Jordan is correct in suggesting or forecasting that many of those individuals are on the way up or will soon be on but\nWhen I Will I Will say that I agree if there is though Andy in the in the thrill to report if there were to be cooperative evidence\nOf one of the allegations that would also be a game changer I think well I mean obviously that would be a problem for the three who are on the fence and it may cause others as well but I say we if there was you know we would know it by now\nYou know gas you get there is if there is anything there it's just a it's a withdrawn and they can vote on that if there's something on the Robert calling\nTournament but one of the fan but you expend McConnell says if you think that culture if we get the if the FBI report comes back in sometimes do they do you think closure tonight\nI think there will be filed tonight ... would be friday yes yeah look if people want to look at C SPAN to look and see if the leader McConnell goes down to the floor you'll have your answer then\nIt was going to take another call All right back to the phones or we go let's go to Robert Ford on line to Robert Robert\nHi two quick questions wander the FBI or or or is there to the president before the Senate\nAnd he believed that it would make any difference as far as the order of that the oil is called\nThe order will make any difference that's easy will now technically this is I Would work with you I I'm not saying we go to the president but it's an executive branch function to the FBI report would go to the executive branch within it would be part of this process\nUh turned over to the legislative branch which would be the the Senate so Judiciary Committee and I think that's how it would go ... I think I don't think the president and could you get a preview I have no idea they report to the president\nSo judges are articles free righteous primarily and then we have the executive branch article to write and then Congress exercises an article one roll right and it's time for the Senate\nOr to exercise it's advice and consent role expeditiously if the uh FBI report or something like ... you\nWrite a back to the phones to call this go to a marine and Indiana online for marine while every new Angela\nHi thank you for taking my call and ... as often as I can um\nDry [noise]\nSome go\nWork late nights have been one S.
