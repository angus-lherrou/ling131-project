met\nAt a time [laughter] so\nI had a comment and that is not something I've seen the Republicans really organized well around but I actually think that a genius but by the Republicans I'm you know flake aside not running for reelection and everything like that but the thing the Dems are screaming for it that that friday here and what they wanted\nAn FBI investigation and they did it really kind of quick at the end flight kind of came up Grassley said OK and flake said I'll take a week or maybe less and that's what and you heard\nDemocrats or Democrat it we thought that spoke say this is exactly what we like yes who want the FBI\nThing and then they closed the hearing and they moved it out and and now it's going to go to a boat and we all know that no one's going to change their mind for cars that cause you it's so hard to prove a negative so this is the one thing you are going to do is you're going to get all the\nThat cloud that would have been over on Capitol if he got confirming the Republicans just push it through they didn't care it's like they did it they let the FBI and they\nGave ... say that I'm not old enough that the problem here is that going to say that's not enough Merriam periscope rights was played more free to make these moves since he isn't really presented again and so yes\nYou have to answer to the Republican primary or a base in the end he was going to lose the primary that's why he's retiring and we let's be honest this guy was going he was going to be primary out of the U.S Senate ah so he decided to retire instead of a face that loss\nUm so I I Do believe listen I I agree with Michael to an extent I think that the American people\nWhich can certainly influence or how the skills I mean these are elected officials either politicians that's that's the point the American people may agree if this report comes back super clean that the Democrats look foolish\nIf ... if they're going to keep complaining so it may be enough for the American people that's what we've said\nIf this report comes back clean Democrats lose likely Rand probably look foolish if they continue to pound they're they're finished uh it's not enough of an FBI investigation of the seven this the seventh now that Brett Kavanaugh has gone through a they've got specific names to go for they've got specific individuals to look to time periods to look at\n'em especially the the this allegation Abigail or they know when it was where it was supposed to be heard who is alleging it and uh and then who would have been in the building I mean I could have gone they could go through so or if there's nothing there\nMay be that the American people say enough you know this and I think that's the best case for for Brett Kavanaugh and for Republicans to get their majority together\nGo ahead and take calls one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten who's next Jodie in Kansas online for Joni welcome to Jay Sekulow alive are generally all huh\nYeah my question is when the I investigated and it's done and back and there is not more evidence or the evidence they would there be any recourse to Dr Ford\nNow here's what are they going to happen I think they're going to say they're not going to call Dr Ford Andy a liar or that she said there was no evidence corroborating Dr Ford's allegations that's all they're going to say\nThat's right if you look at the report to this Rachel Mitchell who was\nHired by the Republicans did the case she says is incredibly difficult to prove is even weaker because she identified a other witnesses to the event and they either refuted or allegations or didn't corroborate\nThem a reasonable prosecutor would not bring she said this is Mitchell says it is a reasonable prosecutor would not bring this case\nUh to trial based on the evidence before the committee and she said that you couldn't even get a preponderance of evidence standard which is the civil standard much less beyond a reasonable doubt\nSo and I tend to agree with her she was not the most uh you know colorful prosecutor or exuberant prosecutor I've ever seen\nThose it probably would have set up it was not goes cracked up and broken up between statements made by but I understand what you're saying All right let's take another call him a large covered Texas on line three law welcome to Jay sexual alive by law\nThank you thank you very much you guys get an awesome job and\nI really appreciate you know I just think real quick payment is that I think what we saw some Kavanaugh's anger with a little bit more than what everybody saying I Believe that he felt the weight of the whole ... do ya that he knew that ... what's going on now to not just intel firm and not just you know good and bad\nHe said she said that the weight of the whole system\nWill look this is his career I mean this man it was a he said sign thought those two things that he said that we're meaningful and pointed to me said listen to things that he loves doing coaching and teaching and based on these allegations he wouldn't be doing either and that area's a pretty strong statement for someone that's an Upper East early reputation for the last twenty five years\nAbsolutely so judge Kavanaugh has been the subject of a sustained and relentless attack\nFor months it's important to realize that Senator Feinstein with how old this allegation this accusation four months before bringing it forward just split for the nomination was going to be voted on\nAnd yet there is no credible evidence at least to this point in support of the specific allegation made at the hearing last week\nA and as I understand it there's no support for the allegation made with respect to the nominees alleged conduct at Yale\nThese well that's what they're investigating absolutely but it's also important to remember a bad however the FBI investigation comes out\nA particularly if the nominee is cleared this will not be enough for the Democrats now see because they're afraid of ... the judge Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy which does not accord with their preferences\nThere particularly afraid that he might limit for instant access to abortion in the future he may not necessarily support the creation of rights which are not rounded in the constitution this is what the Democrats actually opposed\nHere's what about that they've ever going to suffer so it's a character assassination here's what judge have talked about in describing the nature what these proceedings have become\nYears for the following has been ready to DC for politically correct attention

he did talk to women if if they answer these questions and a thorough investigation concludes that\nAre these allegations are not true then we should all move on but if these questions are not
