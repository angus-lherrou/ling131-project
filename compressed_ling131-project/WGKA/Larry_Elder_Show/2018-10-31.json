understand that you and I say this was very bold in very dangerous for these justices but I'm very bold move and a really big step in and the right direction\nJay your per precisely correct this was a brave move by the Pakistani Supreme Court\nAh but more work I think is needed in many of these countries we need to reform of blasphemy laws themselves up but this was a great first step\nWe should

what kind of a wild card has that injected into this race if any\n\n[noise] okay\nAll right he need to get a better finishing okay [noise] All right let's let's move on we're talking about the fourteenth amendment yesterday I interview John nice man the former dean of Chapman University school of law and we talked about this here's what President Trump said\nOn immigration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the citizenship without changing the constitution we have executive order exactly\nOr have you thought about this\nAll it was always told me that you needed a constitutional amendment guessing on and you don't need a number one number one you don't need that number to nothing is you know very much into well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but\nNow they're saying I can do just with an executive order [noise]\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas is ridiculous and it has to end um have you talked about that\nTo wear in the process in the process it will happen\nWhen an executive order that's what you're talking about really has a very interesting because I didn't think anybody ever knew that but me I thought it was the only one China\nCould guess good press\nProfessor Eastman can he do this with an executive order\nWell I Believe because what you wrote her principles because they cannot amend the constitution provide an executive order Congress and amend the constitution by an act of Congress and the Supreme Court isn't supposed to be able to amend the constitution by issuing a judgment or ruling in a cave\nBut that's not what the president is talking about here the constitution doesn't require birthright citizenship if there's anybody born here and subject to the jurisdiction are citizens all he's trying to do with clarify what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction me\nAnd it doesn't mean anybody who happens to be subject to our laws because they're physically present here it meant something much more complete than that oh in the lead into the country being part of the body politic and that's what the debate to the fourteenth amendment make clear\nThat's what the early Supreme Court decisions on that's made clear and the Supreme Court has never held otherwise we now so so that would mean that the children of citizen or the children of lawful permanent residents are automatically citizens by virtue of the fourteenth amendment\nChildren a temporary visit or whether it's a tourist visa or student visa\nOr or or or certainly the children are people who are not lawfully present in the United states at all or not automatic citizens according to the constitution and the president is trying to faithfully apply that clause that it was drafted and ratified and an ad that meant to the people that path\nForty five seconds left professor I thought there was some sort of Supreme Court case that came out in the early eighties has some sort of footnote which people point to to argue that anybody who's in the country even illegally has a child on the American soil a is an automatic citizen isn't there some sort of case that people point to that rightly or wrongly they used to make that argument\nThey do they apply liver at all and it's ridiculous that said that they'd have to provide free education\nTo the children of illegal immigrants under the equal protection clause and excited a footnote that says look they're they're they're awful citizens if they're born here but that was not a holding up their case it was hot it is in that case it was it what we called ... that the Supreme Court for the back of the added added something\nWe come back I'll tell you about what the author of the fourteenth amendment his claws said his name is senator Jacob Howard\nAlso there was an Eighteen eighty four Supreme Court case it ruled that a Native American born under the jurisdiction of a Native American tribes not unilaterally make himself United States citizen that was Eighteen eighty four case Eighteen Ninety a case to court ruled a child born in this country to legal\nResident Chinese immigrants was included in the birthright citizenship but they have never ruled that a child born to illegal aliens on American soil is an automatic citizen yet that is how that fourteenth amendment has been interpreted and what I Believe Donald Trump is doing with this executive order is trying to spark\nA Supreme Court challenge to the executive order that ultimately will go way up to the Supreme Court or in these justices she hopes and I hope will rule the way the senator Jacob powered who drafted this intended it what'd Howard said when he drafted it had it for you when I come back I'm Larry Elder do not leave town\nCalled ... show now with the eighty nine seven one Seventy eighty nine
