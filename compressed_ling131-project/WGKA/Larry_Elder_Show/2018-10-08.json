waiting a diagnosis that would come to days October tenth last year October eleventh same ... wood October tenth\nWill be the day that we got her breast cancer diagnosis and one year to the day on October tenth she finishes this year her last treatment done finished one hundred percent cancer\nFree in large part thanks to all of you and your prayers in thoughts hard to believe it's been a year

you I've met around the country I put my arms around you those if you have come up to me and [noise]\nWell I I Can't thank you enough believe me we're still sifting through the email we got so much of it that is unbelievable and one more thing\nYou know I took some time off a couple of weeks back\nTied to any way best I could took a few days went down to the seaside beach area you know just a little bit Easter Destin west to Panama City the route thirty a area of the Florida Panhandle gorgeous beaches down there\nAnd when I had a house rented for about four days when I got down there I found out that there was some construction work going on in the house I said no no no not going to happen in the house I paid for not going to happen right so a rather than make us think out of the deal you know what I decided to do I decided to play nice with everybody\nWith the with the real estate agent with the with the the the the the managing company which I Believe was Wyndham I play nice with them and you know and and I had an opportunity\nTo me it just re store my state really in in these tough incredibly difficult trying political times in America today sometimes we we tend to look at things through that prism we don't know who we are talking to and sometimes we attack\nWe go on the attack because we're so edgy\nWe just don't know when this this this world we live in today puts us in that terrible mood\nAnd you know I met some great people one of them was a guy named Vance garrison who was the roof or doing the work at the house and I had a conversation with my son I look on vacation he says no we don't want to mess with your vacation when are you leaving\nI sit on Wednesday he says will see on Wednesday did enjoy your time off and it was everything just worked out perfect amazing what being nice can do you get it back\nIs what I'm telling you you get it\nBack and he's with royal roofing and restoration those guys were unbelievable\nAnd they're listening on W why oh well right now one oh one FM news talk in the Panama City area was fun I got to listen to my own show\nBearing down there while I was sitting there having a nice big fat cigar listening to the lay waves lap up on the shore a couple of weeks ago and I really appreciate the help from those guys and everybody Vance matter love you guys you guys have a great job\nThank you restore people where you would just be store faith in humanity so nice to meet good people and their fans of the show what does that tell your right okay so that's some fun stuff let me give you the guest line up we're going to jump right into it\nAlan Gottlieb is going to join you know I have so much to go over with and we're going to keep them for a couple of segments I've got a surprise call coming in\nFrom Rob Pincus about a video you got to squeeze 'em in in the final segment so let's go right smack the Allen got the founder of the second amendment foundation Alan Carr the heck are you there is faith in humanity out there isn't there out and there are great people out there when you find the right\n[laughter] yeah they're all gonna owners [laughter]\nThey have done if I can attest to that I Know Vance and the rest of those guys are where we had some just fantastic conversation and you're right they absolutely are boy but it was it was a it was kind of an eye opening thing you go in and you think bad attitude and then what do you do you draw bad things going with a great attitude and great things happened\nSo I just wanted to just kind of want to throw that let's start with this this is the gorilla elephant whatever you want to call it in the room Kavanaugh you've got to tell me how you feel after bruising thing\n[noise] [noise] well I feel really great I think get any guides community should be on cloud nine ah this is very important battles with the lights\nOn it especially a static because we have to search conditions ... cutting us cringe court this term and of course a cabinet was it that it would give us a lot of problems in in getting those a cert petition is either heard or you know\nUh getting a confirmation for the Supreme Court to correct a last ditch\nSo I'm kind of excited on going to be on pins and needles the session a digital important cases one is Lance coming out of the ... circuit what were you one of the trial court level and then lost by one vote ... panel\nAnd the ... circuit that sticks to get knocked out for a while at least the interstate ban on sales handguns and Atlantic she fit and collect\nYour not says we're using the same lab a it's a background check all across the country there's no reason why you could buy it shouldn't be able to buy and get anywhere it's the same background check and then our second suit his tenure at California in the Ninth Circuit will lure overturned a you know again I mean by panel\nIn the Ninth Circuit a and that's the one that deals with California so called Hank roster showing diminishing our Hank as there are a lot for sale in California every year\nA and virtually no new tankers get added to the list old fall officers less less choice for buying handguns in California and also deals with so called micro stamp requirement\nOr where any new new handgun has to be able to be shown micro standing out on it when you know if I had a cartridge\nUm and and the technology it's unproven and only as a single source provider to it\nAh and it's a real problem so I'm kind of excited about both those cases and and now I have a lot to look forward to this coming year\nOh my gosh you know Alan\nHave to listen to your [noise] those are pages of notes of things that I Want to talk with you about and you kind of it's so easy for you to just make it easy for me to crumble those up from wind okay let's go down some of the rabbit holes that you just opened up their let's talk briefly about the two cases now that Kavanaugh is on the court\nWhat I heard and I'm not speaking on behalf of my listeners just make sure that they understand what I heard on when you have to get that information to them what I understand now is that with these two petitions now waiting that the court is getting ready to look at these in upcoming conferences or you're getting ready to file these where are we\nThere filed a we're waiting for the ... for the conference assignments right now or some kind of and that they should be ... you know there should be hopefully they'll take the case isn't how Google have argued that so we're going to wear on pins and needles right now [noise] All right\nSo let me play a little bit of devil's advocate we know what happened with Gorsuch and with Thomas at the perimeter when they when the court did not grant search to that what I thought was a very very important case out there in California I really wish I know all of us in the gun rights community had thought and hope and pray that they were going to take they did not\nAnd of course Gorsuch and Thomas penned a scathing I guess to dissent as to why they should have a you know blaming the fact that the courts have been afraid of the second amendment as of late treating it as a second class right having said that\nIt does this if either of these two cases get in just that pushes back further for any other cases that might be upcoming in other words will the court look at this and say you know what we don't want to take these yet or if we take these maybe not take one of these concealed carry cases down the road do we have to be concerned with that\nWell one never knows no one knows what the logic is an Audi cake this at all I can say is that you know as most of your listeners probably know it takes four justices design type the psyche hear a case right but it takes five it takes five to win it and usually if this for don't think they have this year so they don't want to take the case\nSo ... one would have to make the assumption that the reason why brutal wasn't cake you once they weren't sure they had the ...\nUh I'm hoping now we have the ...\nAll right we're going to call this segment\nOne for the books when we come back I'm going to continue with Alan Gottlieb founder of the second amendment foundation I've got a number of things I Want to talk with him about\nBloomberg was reported at a GOP USA and I guess uh they link to it from Washington Times\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly argued friday the guns needs to be kept out of the hands of minorities in order to keep them alive while speaking at the Aspen Institute Bloomberg Seventy two said Ninety five percent of murders fall into a category\nA male minority between the ages of Fifteen and twenty five quoting cities need to get guns out of this group than and keep them alive the former three term ... said these kids think they're going to get killed anyway because all their friends are getting killed\nThey just don't have any long term focus on anything it's a joke to have a gun it's a joke to pull the trigger and he said something like this a couple of years back we talked about my gosh I Would if any of us said that we'd be racist all day long if he's serious about that\nBad here that he is serious about it that's his elite is showing grew out\nYou know the demand I mean he really is a ... and if you remember the already used to like issue with that is a guy that thinks he knows how to run your life better that you can run it on your own it really doesn't matter what your guts are sugary drinks I mean this guy is crazy I mean he won't he wants to cradle to grave take care of all of us in his banner\nHis way give us no freedom period\nYou know I always found it interesting out and we'll take this into the bottom of having to go into the break the next segment within a couple of more topics but I always found it interesting just ironic\nTo me I found it humorous it was comical to me that while Bloomberg was the mayor of New York he was going after what you just said sugary drinks too much soda telling people what to eat\nAnd here's this guy stands up at the podium and kicks off every year the Nathan's hotdog eating contest with these guys are shoving Seventy five hotdogs down their stomach them better ten minutes\nAnd wash it down and they're serving all kinds of beer and so to their ears up on the podium giving it a big kick off I always thought that was kind of ironic I guess if it if it brings money and attention it's okay\nBut if not just for you okay for me not for the type of thing with Michael Bloomberg always found that interesting but I also find with there's interesting because the largest fastest growing group of gun owners in America are minorities and you and I saw that together with the groups that we met with\nAnd heard speak at the G R PC twenty seconds to the break I'll let you take it away isn't that the case\nYeah we had lots of minorities people of color policy conference in Chicago a A R R diversity is growing and of course that scares and again as as well uh ... yeah ... yeah I mean well we're going to win this battle over time it's just we have to stay in the fight\nThat were staying

and I'm here with my saw from health markets a national organization helping folks find the right Medicare coverage Mike the news reports keep saying that the rates might actually be going down\nThe cost of many Medicare plans are decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate help markets offers a free service would access at the helm of a Medicare plan plans I can eliminate you're out of pocket costs plans with zero dollar premium and eat and plans that have you back\nRight Mike with the enrollment deadline for Medicare coming soon what should people keep in mind\nWith so many new options they can be confused you can get objected to how to find a plan and they cost less and cover more with lower co pay more choices like dental vision and prescription drug coverage and the freedom to see the doctors use you don't miss out on savings you deserve our help markets Medicare system it's free\nThanks my folks your Medicare is just too important to put off so called health markets today and find out how much you can be saving\nCoal eight hundred seven one six Seventy seven eighty that's eight hundred seven one six Seventy seven eighty eight hundred

the poor cat tightening in front of ... and ...\nLive from the AM nine twenty the answers to the I was in bucket it's eighty four degrees\n\nAnd we just had a great question came in my face but from John in St Louis ... the Democratic party it across their ideology and become a consensus that we've had here\nIn our studio was yes because you've got this um when I called mainstream democratic thought this is a more centrist and then you had this progressive to the right of to the left to Bernie Sanders almost a approach going up and how to you you're up there what do you what are you saying\nWell the only thing I Would add to the conversation James I think there's a struggle even inside the elected members of the party in Jordan talked about how Nancy Pelosi would be the new speaker likely if the Democrats retain power I mean that's actually an open question because if they're going to get a majority Jay it's going to have to involve Democrats who actually campaigning\nOpposed to Nancy Pelosi both from the left in the right so I think there's kind of two questions for House Democrats one can we get the majority back into\nWho can unite around they can get two hundred and Eighteen votes on the floor of the house or to be the speaker of the house so I think there is a a really there are a lot of fractions inside the party right now are left I Would say less center and then far far left and they're having their own fight on it\nAbsolutely All right let's go right back to the phones yeah Linda calling from Georgia on line for Linda welcome to chase you'll live Linda go ahead\nThank you for taking my call today I was listening and I just you know I Am a independent conservative I grew up a African\nAmerican dad was Democrat you know we knew what our parents Dale and half of the two thousand election I came out of the party I think uh this they said I'm senator Collins gay I\nThink it'll galvanized ... and I gave that extra pet for people to get out to vote 'em\nYou know I mean talking to different people I just feel that um\n[noise] you know people are tired of what they're saying we you know I'm a mom with three adopted kids out of this as well and I want to say good things happen sure and I'm not as mine chicken stakes in raising three kids want to see good things happen for our children and what I see or\nHear happening is that what time did we wake up we have data fish to fry and I voted for President Trump\nBecause I think the energy that he brings this is what we need to move America forward on disk and wondering what you think about the parties would this that we've seen going on\nWhy would you said is ... what part of Georgia you live at\nI'm In Hiram ... last yeah\nKnow no harm so look I mean I I think your your what you said eloquently is the kind of where things\nAre I think that the American people you could take a much broader than Georgia the American people are looking at how does this impact my children and grandchildren\nAnd you've got a situation now you look at the stability global stability which you have a love of civility right now in the way we haven't seen in ... in a decade or you have a sense of momentum I think on in the economy\nA lower unemployment\nA ban even though they historically that it's still tells you that there's a switch in the in the house leadership or in midterms there's this this this presidency has not gone by the norms\nYeah I mean that that this historical data is political data admitted to data that says the heads of difficult for a political party that is in power to get the enthusiasm gap up but Jay or the the economic data and the other sort of back\nTo base data really all is flowing in the direction of the GOP right now so you know it's going to be a fascinating political study to see which of those two carries a because\nIf you took just the one who would say the Democrats are going to win if you take just the other would say the Republicans are going to I think both are going to be very close but I'll be honest with you if I was going to be one party or the other heading into these midterms\nThere's no question I'd rather be the Republican Party you think\nThe momentum shipped has been that significant\nAbsolutely and I don't think that I don't think the Democrats ever really had a real path in the Senate was only in the house and they saw that path in the house narrowed significantly over the last month\nFrom losing college not usually conservative hero\nWho she spoke to yesterday conservatives were very excited about what she did appreciate what she did for judge Kavanaugh\nIn that speech her remarks but I think it was broader than that so conservatives appreciate what she did even though they don't always agree with her\nA politically it does show the big tent Republican Party but independence and more moderate Republicans who may not have been as enthusiastic about getting out to vote this election cycle and never are in mid term election cycles\nI think that's who she was speaking to Susan Collins and if you could start as we said uniting the party that way with twenty nine days out well who cares about what happened fifty sixty days out\nWe now you're about what's happening now you know what what did you have in the present that would affect the term elections not how they were doing Democrats two months ago at war even three weeks ago when we were on the show talking about how now the city that might be in play\nAnd it was the big sea change you get through it all goes down there is not going to be probably political isn't it as big as the Supreme Court confirmation though\nIn the next day or not I mean the next twenty nine days\nSo darn let's let's take another call yeah this is an easy one to answer from Larry and then Indiana on line one Larry welcome to Jason ...\nOh yeah I'm going well getting past so I don't know what I asked all the stuff with what is the confirmation but ah what do you see is as far as this open spaces that he left\nIt'll be it'll be a nomination put forward by the president and then we'll go through the process within the same thing in a house ...\nWho there may be other vacancies and that'll yes sure I don't feel pretty quickly in DC yeah a buddy at opens up one of these don't get as much attention usually sometimes there's some fighting in the Senate but ah it's not like the U.S Supreme Court where\nIt's like there's a ... like they're having to operate a down one it's not like that it's a circuit court where it's a really affects things as much you know I think that's I think that's where I was going to take another call to grab from culture yeah a Kim in Kansas online six Kim welcome to Jason ... if I can go ahead\nI well first of all you mentioned earlier somebody mentioned about how satisfied a string the Democratic party that they stick together and my thought on that is that I'm\nLindsey Graham said if they ever get up at the average salary that they're looking for you and because they can't it's not working out they had a map and things like themselves somebody calling the shots probably a couple of people at the top there and none of them are thinking for themselves they just pretty much just get those ... right\n...\nAh Larry over here the said from South central the unit of economic ... don't
