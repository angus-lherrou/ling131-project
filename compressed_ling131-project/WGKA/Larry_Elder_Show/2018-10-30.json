and let me get his promise I'll open our number three with the really moving moment of Sarah Sanders giving of the White House is of the\nRichest most uplifting blessing\nTo those are lost in the Pittsburgh massacre and then you'll just the heads snapping change of direction\nAs a as she throws it open for questions an immediate ... essentially be be instant wave of questions is a a Trump responsible for all this\nAnd then that's because that's what they think and uh\nIt's all had that for you right there at the beginning of the very next hour where in Sacramento Dave hey Mark Davis in Fort Larry welcome our you\nJust as every bombs in life is his own responsibilities regardless of who he chooses to\nDo some\nAdvice you don't know what\nThey're getting a job\nWith all the way it has

hiatus there and now he's a that they're doing some during that's nothing but a good thing or so whether you are listening here in the ... or a cook in Katmandu is great to have your Mark Davis in Fort Larry Elder from six sixty eight\nThe answer Dallas Fort Worth hope all is well would you look I and I've got to heat up queued up ready to go Sarah Sanders a wonderful moving moment\nThen into the um and then into the jackals questioning or about why it's all Trump's fault but I'm Sorry I I just I've got a shoe on something and you're ready or the beginning because I just I've just absorb this myself\nAnd look I I don't I don't really care what is in Shepard Smith brain I often care even less about what's what comes out of his mouth but at Fox News you have to know something\nAnd and I don't know what the deal is is there is there a of a a turnover in either the leadership change or a change of flavor is it but because I mean Hannity still Hannity\nThe addition of shows like Laura Ingraham a magnificent of of of Brett Baer doing special report a Tucker Carlson is just a star and and I just love it love him and it's not like I necessarily need to all my conservative shows\nTo have exactly the same take because even as conservatives as Republicans ... there there are shades and nuances and ... and things that we we don't all we don't walk in lockstep like Democrats do I envy them mad sometimes but but we don't but what about leading up to here\nI I just I Need you to absorb a minute and a fraction here\nOf of shepherd Smith\nOf it this is a it's funny ... there there would be opinion shows and there are the news shows\nBut look there they're all ... maybe ... from the news he is show that Fox does is special report with Brett Baer where you basically get a straight dose of news him in a panel of people have a wide variety of views who discuss it and that's great\nHannity conservative opinion show Laura Ingraham conservative opinion Joe Tucker Carlson conservative opinion show Martin I'm a gallon planet more more straight and and less of of of her opinions and it's great and they're all great luck the hell is that it met our was Shepard Smith just what is that\nYou got that starship enterprise set may cover breaking news and and ... is a talented man he has a compelling broadcaster\nFought in the world compels him to do list today\nThe U.S will deploy some five thousand troops to the southern border as early tomorrow as thousands of migrants make their way north from Mexico tomorrow\nThe migrants according to Fox is reporting are more than two months away if any of them actually come here but\nTomorrow is one week before the midterm election\nWhich is what all of this is about there is no invasion no one's coming to get you there's nothing at all to worry about\nReally now\nObviously look what I Do for a living everyone's entitled to an opinion obviously this is a mockery of Americans not all of them necessarily conservative most of them probably are\nThat right there was a mockery\nOf you if you think thousands of people pouring across the border is a bad idea\nI don't expect that they're going to set up a you know an MS Thirteen headquarters next door to my house I don't expect that but you know a hundred thousand of them will come pouring across the border like some remake of World War Z\nBut I Do expect that if we don't make a strong message that this caravan will come and if it is to excess full in reaching our borders then others will follow\nAnd I do not need weasel lectures from the likes of shepherd Smith about how my concerns are are somehow still is titled the view he absolutely is I Would expect it from from psychopaths like Lawrence O'Donnell\nAnd and from finger wagging ... goal like Rachel Maddow I Would expect it from that\nAnd again and and I just wanted to I I don't need Fox News to be a heat\nYou know which we all suffer all for for just the same exact echo chamber news every day I I I liked diversity of opinion I like 'em but they they do they give this guy a show they give it a sinking show every day to insult the Fox news base\nAnd I just want you to do it by accident is intentional they know he's doing it and they wanted him to do it why you'd have to ask them object let's see here [laughter] ...\nLet me call in or is it wasn't a break come back and you'll hear Sarah Sanders in the media jak holes going after stone after we were in LA rich hey Mark Davis in for Larry welcome how are you [noise]\n[noise] Hi thank you very well might are a little nervous but here's my thing is that in the ah anybody listening to my go for it or ball that'd be one year old I watch the news and especially when I catch a credit score I get so mad I have to get off the TV and I have to go meditate\nBecause I'm not going to you by white finished it and I\nGet mad and I talked to other people and they get mad I have a real question here who created this press corps who voted all these guys in okay the credentials and then how do they ever get to say they represent me\nVery that I Know that they and they and they know it and they don't care not and and I mean they're not supposed to quote unquote represent us in the way that elected officials do they are supposed to cover news in an unbiased and professionally honest\nAnd corrupted matter and the media have not done that successfully in at least a couple of generations and\nThe bird go have you not heard Americans want you know [laughter] we record we represent the American populace hello now\nAnd and it's an ... rich ... thank you I mean\nThere are an opinion shows I Love the opinion shows the conservative opinion shows tend to show up on Fox obviously the liberal opinion shows I mean ... I mean listen I just took a little jab at both Donald and met Alan Chris Matthews that whole coven and\nAnd and and and the end of that\nTotal head case Joe Scarborough but did they get to be over there on MSNBC and stoke the Trump painting fire of their viewer base of course they do of course they do and it's a free country and and there's a marketplace out there and\nAnd they've got X number of viewers and Fox has X number of viewers and and the trolls over on CNN at X number of viewers and they're all trying to slice of pie and get as many folks who they can and sell advertising and make a buck good for them that's\nAll just fine but remember what reporting used to be all share a secret would have already draw close to the radio real quick\n[noise] I have\nA journalism degree\nPull up I Know I Know I Do University of Maryland Nineteen Seventy nine College of journalism proud of it\nAnd I was going to say that somebody is happy I went and uh and and then radio news reporting in Charleston West Virginia soon to elect Senator Patrick Morrisey or\nIt had a blast my first two years I went to Jacksonville, Florida it's more reporting before the talk show thing drops in my lap\nAnd I guess that's worked out well for everybody but when I was a reporter when I was studying journalism everything was drilled into us even in the People's Republic of narrowed was objectivity present both sides to try to keep your own opinions out of your stories where in the world does that go [noise]\nAlright where's where I'm going to goes out for a second let you uh catch a couple of messages and come back and the message of Sarah Sanders is very moving in the press briefing and\nBut now released the house [noise]\nSort of the president said over\nThat you have any concern at all his words\nIs certainly a the president wants a enormous where our country is hurting like we've seen 'em in the last several days of find ways to bring our country together and we've seen him do exactly that\nHowever the president is going to continue to draw a contrast a particularly as we go into the final days of an election the differences between the two parties particularly on policy differences you'll continue to see him make that contrast a but he had certainly I think\nFound those known that to bring our country together and certainly focused on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us can condemn as well if\nHe's also harshly attack some of the very people who've received those fight bombs and this morning suggesting that the news media is responsible\nThe country how does he do that when the pipe bomb or this was somebody who\nWas the Trump rallies this is somebody ought to\nA tax on the media praised for for the president on\nShooter in Pittsburgh is somebody who was of\nPromote it seems by the caravan of presidents with so much time talking about what why is he out there when you say train you country why is he out there are very very first\nThing that the president didn't which can daily attacks in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these regain Hugh accent\nIs outrageous that that would be the very first reaction is so many people are probably the country I'm\nNot finished the only person responsible for carrying out either these heinous acts were the individuals who carried them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders fault for the individual who shot up a baseball field if congressional Republicans you can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime\nBam thank you very very much Sarah Huckabee Sanders for the win\n... were destructive poisonous cub and this this media community is and people wonder why discourse is a is dashed against the rocks\nIt's not because Trump one or the occasional bar but he throws in a tweet or the occasional moment in a rally the entire culture of reporters editors commentators who say that we're currently led by a racist ... to\nHater a an evil person Howard Dean ... president magistrates is evil president United States is evil our day really that's why discourse is in trouble it ain't Trump's fault Mark Davis info Larry be right back you're listening to the Larry Elder\nAbuse opinion inside am nine twenty ...

are us citizens that it's been decided by the Supreme Court way back to the Eighteen hundreds their children are us is that so we're talking about a pretty narrow category but a lot of people who are doing it in the hundreds of thousands each year I told you take your phone calls the or do they come in and we're going to do that\nRight now Vicky is calling from Michigan on line six Vicky welcome

agree with what Trump stealing\nYeah a lot of us have this experience laws have changed since Nineteen oh died\nOr been clarified states you know died would there were those big immigration waves there in the Eighteen hundreds of green cards were given out you are correct that the children are especially if the children were born in the United states\nBut we're so we're not uh uh but if they were born in the United states had to also apply for citizenship as well but laws have been changed we could say brought it out as well but I think you know a appreciating our history and realizing that based off this constitutional provision\nThings have changed since ... a significantly really starting today teeth sixties really that that time period we started to allow this idea\nOf the

I'm calling from actually Arizona [noise] ah what happened is I just want people to understand I'm an immigrant myself I came here a naturalized and I'm a U.S citizen and like I just want people to know that uh people out of the country\nAnd all the U.S laws better than people who live here I\nDidn't know how to men in Calais is say stem oil and didn't have the key of Americans I guess could not believe that let me give you that for an example for for instance Liberia\nIn Africa I was born in Africa yeah Liberia in their cost to show people it's that the white man kidnapped obesity saying\nWhat are you a bond there or\nAnything except you ... ... even if you married to one you can never be ... you can only be able to own land by Mary into Liberia and\nSo when you see all these things like China for instance you better be Chinese to Chinese rule of law and order you borrow one thousand children that they all can that be citizens so I think\nAmericans need to be educated to rules outside of this country and maybe they were all this and what you guys are talking about because it's unfair to Americans that we can't Congress here we can have two all citizens shapes but Americans getting a house dog a shaved with these ... countries\nHere you know it's interesting some countries do a dual citizenship for us but I think what you said your show which was dead on\nI'll let our guys discuss and then we want to get to calls is it what we have these unbelievably open laws here we're a country that welcomes have regrets because the British basically immigration not by\nWhat race you are but Shelley you are or were a melting pot but ... what is most important is that people outside the u._s. there are laws that are that we do and they know how to ... to\nYeah there are so many loopholes and inconsistencies in our laws and I think the average American the caller's right we do not understand if people that are trying to get here they understand it very very well but there is no real definitive statute that deals with what we're talking about today and they're certainly not ... not a Supreme Court president\nAnd that's why I think what the president is doing will force our hand as a population to actually deal with this and to come up with something that that can be articulated and that is understood by everybody\n... call illustrates the necessity of reforming\nThe U.S immigration system so I think President Trump is right or to suggest change change is necessary in part because many foreign nationals fully understand the loopholes that already exist\nIn US law heroin calling from Austin, Texas I lied to Carol welcome to Jay say he'll alive\nThank you address my point I think in that I really do yeah I I Am in total agreement that certainly has to be down and that the um birthday but I don't understand why President Trump wouldn't do it I execute order going how easily it can be ironed out like if it was her\nClinton if you're looking for some positive inspiration for your day check out they talk Atlanta where you can hear some of the nation's best preaching and teach and\nBe sure to join us to say talk live ten AM every day in Ninety three PM on nine Seventy on line who think fucking land and knocked on\n\n\nOnce again Senate Democrats are threatening to break the rules of the price of the rules of the [noise] in order to change the rules of\nThat over what [noise]\n\nThe following has been ready to DC for politically correct attention you're dismayed learns say we\nMay\nHear the same syndrome is the\nWay she does allow me to say or do you\n\nFrom nine to one S.

seven to ... for three but first please welcome back to the program\nJohn Dean Acheson the\nJustice Clarence Thomas ... time I really do appreciate it\nLarry ... is always a pleasure to be on with the great the age of south central\nThank you I Want to talk to you first about the Caribbean and then I Want to talk to you about President Trump's assertion that he can change the interpretation of fourteenth amendment which has been interpreted to allow an illegal alien to come to this country have a child on American soil and that challenge medically becomes an American citizen but first talk about the caravan\nTell me what legal authority he has to put troops on the border\nAbout you know a true stopping in a date and then the United states is one of the primary reason we ask drew a dating back to the civil war there's a federal law called the ... comic heart attack\nThat says the U.S military can't be used in the interior of the United states for regular police activity but that's not what President Trump is proposing to do is proposing to put them on the border to stop folks from illegally invading our country\n[noise] professor how come previous presidents haven't done this I mean this this so called invasion as you put it has happened year after year after year not quite as large but why have another president's done this\nWell because they don't like our immigration laws and they're not willing to enforce them and they don't they don't think about the consequences of what this lawlessness is doing to our society\nLet's talk about consequences professor what happens if somebody gets shot\nWell that's a terrible thing and you know uh uh I'm hoping that that doesn't happen that's clearly what the laughter that is funding this caravan is hoping will happen or even better in their view would be that it were a child so we can get the nightly news running constantly and tell them between now and election day\nBut the fact of the matter is these people are putting themselves and their children in harm's way abide violating the laws of this country or they claim that they are refugees and we have an international law obligation to consider their claims for asylum\nBut as far as I've been able to tell them not one of them is making claims that actually fit the definition the legal definition of refugee\nThey're not fleeing their countries because they are being persecuted because of their political or religious\nOr race or ethnic views they're playing their country because they want to go to a place that has a better economy that's not one of the ground for refugee status\nWhy hasn't Mexico stop them even after Donald Trump has told them to even after Donald Trump has said he's going to withhold aid from one moment in Honduras my resume I have some sort of economic punishment to Mexico Hochul Mexico hasn't stopped them\nAbout the same international law that were require us to consider their claims for asylum required Mexico to consider their claims for asylum as well er and Mexico should be stopping now because that was the first country that they entered into illegally to make these refugee claim\nUm but but some of them have and I think Mexico was profit processing knows but some of the uh we don't want to stop and Mexico we want to get all the way the United states which is just further proof that this was on concern about persecution in their home countries if they want a different economy to live and and that's not a ground for refugee status\n[noise] what would happen professor if we're allowed fourteen or seven thousand ... migrants to transport themselves to our country to go on the way up to Canada\n... candidate would stop him as well same reasons you know there there are legal processes in place here in countries have the ability to define a you know what their immigration and naturalization policies are\nIf if you don't allow that then they're ... you have no such thing as a nation you have no such thing as sovereignty President Trump is absolutely correct on that Without Borders you have no nation\nExplained the grounds for which people can apply for asylum\nAbout you've got to have a credible claim that you are being persecuted or under threat of persecution based on your political views your religion or your um your race\nOr your ethnic background those sorts of things just being poor and wanting a better life has a lot of ground for refugee status for asylum under international law and certainly not under any of the law the United states\nThe president is a professor has said that there may be some bad guys there including maybe people from ISIS or even al ... is there any basis to believe that\nWell we've we've seen some reports of that I I'm not\nPrivy to the intelligence but it wouldn't surprise me that border is poor and if you're stopping people at the port of entry on the east coast in New York or what have you and vetting them properly uh than than folks that are in aiming to come here to the United states to do with terrorist harm\n... with the more poor entry and that Mexican border is right now the poorer than tree so it wouldn't surprise me to find\nA significant number of potential terrorists in this group\nMy professor John ... Chapman University school of law professor what about funding you mentioned that this Margaret a Caribbean as being funded by the last what do you mean\nAbout you know it made it takes a lot of money to transport seven thousand people to feed them every day uh you know over the span of space that they've gone and that's ... I Want to know who's funding it\nAnd if they were so poor in their country that they couldn't uh eke out a living who's paying for them to eat on the ... along the way somebody must be doing it and quite frankly it promotes likely\nYeah you you just kind of go to the explanation that makes ... that it's most likely somebody that is trying to interfere with the U.S election by setting up a confrontation that then the meat news media\nCan turn a contrary to President Trump and his supporters\nLet's turn to the fourteenth amendment here's what President Trump said\nOnly immigration some legal scholars believe he's getting rid of the citizenship without changing the constitution Wade executive order exactly right or have you thought about the U.S\nThem all it was always told me that you needed a constitutional amendment on and you don't number one number one you don't need that nobody does you know very much into well you can definitely do it was an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas just and it has to end some have you talked about that\nSomewhere in the sense in the process it will happen\nIs an executive order that's what you're talking about when I was thinking about I didn't think anybody but I knew that but me I thought it was the only one China\nGuess could get\nYou shouldn't do this with an executive order while\nI Believe these ... what's your your or first principles the president cannot amend the constitution and executive order Congress can amend the constitution by an act of Congress and the Supreme Court isn't supposed to be able to amend the constitution by issuing a judgment or ruling in a cave\nBut that's not what the president is talking about here the constitution doesn't require birthright citizenship if there's anybody born here and subject to the jurisdiction are citizens all he's trying to do with clarify what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction mean\nAnd it doesn't mean anybody who happened to be subject to our laws because they're physically present here it meant something much more complete them at all when the lead into the country being part of the body politic and that's what the debate of the fourteenth amendment make clear that's what the early Supreme Court decisions on that's made clear and the Supreme Court has never held otherwise\nUh we now so so that would mean that the children of citizens\nOr the children of lawful permanent residents are automatically citizens by virtue of the fourteenth amendment\nBut the children of temporary visit or whether it's a tourist visa or student visa\nAnd it uh and it takes an awful long time\nProfessor my next question was going to be why aren't Californians outrage and recall studying economics in college and in recognizing that the price of these regulations jacks up the price of a of housing but I didn't realize it was at that high fifty percent and if I didn't realize that I think a lot of people are unaware of it as well\n[noise] yes um I think people are becoming more aware of that now given just how rapidly prices are rising uh ... only about twenty six percent\nOf California households and this includes households with multiple wage earners only about twenty six percent of households can afford the median price Tom in California\nAnd people often think well what about all those people that make those high salaries up in Silicon valley or forty two is even worse they're only about Fifteen Percent of households in the Silicon Valley area can afford the median price Tom in that location\nSo there's no there's no sense in which um there's there's there's there's absolutely a housing crisis in California and people are becoming very very upset about this and they're looking for government ah to put in place policies that will make it easier and less costly to build a an increase supply and bring those prices down\nYou might remember a few years ago professor I I got to fact check when I was on CNN when I talked about um the\nThe high cost of a of a regulations and said that if you add up the taxes and regulations are all those things government takes about fifty percent away from the American people I've got a phone call from from some fact checker and they said how you know the cost of regulation is what'd you say it is a and\nI'm a I recommended them to a number of people and I recall you telling me that if anything I'd probably understated the or the number and the argument they gave me was that regulations also have benefits and and you're not taking the exhilaration the benefits that these regulations produce what's your reaction to that\n[noise] well regulation exist to provide protection is supposed to provide protection to consumers\nRegulations in the housing market [noise] when I look at them I really can't see much a protection for consumers um let's take California's latest folly which is to require by two thousand twenty of virtually every single family home will be required\nHave solar panels on its roof top\nThis will raise the cost of a building that home by about thirty thousand dollars [noise]\nAll for the purpose of generating solar power we already have so much solar generation that we are paying Arizona to kick solar power offer hinge around around noon one PM [noise] um that type of regulation feeds into [noise]\nA small number of people on the state who think it's just absolutely wonderful if we do everything we can under the sun\nTo be green um but it punishes people who have to pay those housing prices um so the residential housing market in California's not placed regulations really benefiting the consumers\nI'm Talking to UCLA professor in the teaching economics since ... he co
