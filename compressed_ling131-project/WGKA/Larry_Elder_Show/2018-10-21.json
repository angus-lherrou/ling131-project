U. A. W. E. Y. but it's pronounced while ways\nIt sounds like a fern name like you know the name one way to like a a happy\nName where they very well could be in betting spy materials and keeping an eye on anything you are doing now mind you unless you work for the Pentagon or bowling or you know a military hardware manufacturers something like that probably would make a bit of difference but\nIf they're telling us that none of the U.S agencies are allowed to own any ... gear and they don't recommend that citizens do either well there's something to that great they got a brand new phone trying to compete with apple and Samsung and stuff and it's nice\n... in China and use them there where the Chinese government already spies on you know they have another device to do it\nNice [laughter] accurate [laughter] are you tired of getting spam phone calls about the people\nBehind the early as friday I Am but yeah but now on top of that we're getting all this spam calls to\nYou know there's lots of reminders about ways you can avoid those\nIf you answer with silence because when you say nothing at all automated voice activated calls don't launched the robocalls recording\nWhich normally transfers due to a call center where the live operator tried to get your personal financial information but if you say nothing but usually a disconnect the confidence seconds and sometimes gets you off there left\nYou cannot failure apps there's lots of options available on the app store they can flag and block frequent fire Geron causing messages\nOr you could do like I Do and I just don't have a son\nAnd I haven't been out to just doesn't answer the phone if it's important enough to leave a voice message attacks me or text so then if what you're saying is if you guys called me and I'd just answer with silence\nWe call you can\nDo call once in a while and then but if I answer was ... what do you do do you go\nBelow I don't want to call you after press one [laughter] that's true [laughter] which is another way you can get around all these robocalls yes because then you've got to have somebody in information technology who can do that for you with an auto attendant\nBecause that's true you call me and\nI can I answer with my breathing or something like if you're a robocall or spam or trying to sell me something go away if not you're a real person then you want to talk to me press one you know I'm so used to hearing you know press one for English would do is you know press one if you're a real person [laughter] instead of press one for English press one for me [laughter]\nAnd it works well to separate his you'd actually had a few of those new telemarketers actually first one to get anyway [laughter]\nAlthough I did have an Hooper drivers I'd had a problem because apparently when he was calling my other number ... routed to that number\nAnd ... and when we finally connected in a parking lot as I was leaving a TV interview the other day\nAnd and they said oh we'll send the car for you and I thought it was going to be a limo now it's a number of\nThe car they didn't lie and then of course that they then sent the car to bring me back to the to our studios\nAnd the turned out the guy was looking for me and then he goes oh I think that you are up ahead yeah the guy standing out there waving at you because that's the car that's identify no but he says I kept calling you and it said press one if I'm not trying to sell you something and he goes up just your driver he knew [laughter] I said well it's a good thing we met up\nThem So Apple now allows us users to download all of their data from a company this is following a GDP are mandated feature for use citizens that wants to make\nThe download tool is accessible from a company's data and privacy page and it encompasses device sinking data like iCloud book marks as well as I tunes purchases and retail level information like your apple care support history\nUsers will have to authenticate with or apple id before receiving their data and they're also encouraging users to turn on two factor authentication which I Know it keeps more secure but I find that kind of a hassle because every time you try to log in something to do text you a code that you didn't have it in and um but they're also giving people the option to opt out of targeted ads and notifications from apple do well\nNow that's a good thing and instead of just giving everyone else your data at least they're giving it to you yeah so so hopefully they'll have their act together\nTechnologies proving to be a continued great tool for learning I study conducted by many American Dream university found that eighty two percent a survey teachers believe technology in Kansas learning that's helping develop

digital platforms and propositions\nThat means from Philips ... will come back into tomorrow how are ya\nHey Dave thanks for having me get to the back\nLet's talk about what's been going on with Philip since we last spoke in person at ... at a two years you always got sun things to talk about\nYeah so we really been continuing our journey here to try to bring professional health care expertise to to consumers [noise] um I think as you and I have talked in the past were observing that um the world that we're living in is really changing that this exponential rate them and people are looking for\nI'm experiencing a seamless transition between different stages in their life or between different experiences of health care whether they're at home or they're in the hospital so we really been trying to work on bringing new meaningful innovations the market that help people make better decisions about their health\nRegardless of where you are\nAnd a funny enough that actually starts right in your mouth\n[laughter] one of the things that I can\nCome [laughter] one of the innovations that you saw a present at the S.\nUm in April was the Philips on the care diamond cleaned smart\nWhich is part of our our healthcare platform so we don't really look at this um toothbrushes anymore we look at it as the beginning of an oil healthcare platform that really harnesses technology to help people better understand um there there are all hygiene causes of poor oral hygiene\nUm and how they can really take control of oral health and effectively therefore start to bridge I'm healthier habits that in fact a impact their entire systemic health\nAnd lay out that such a good point and I know if you if you ask any dentist they'll tell you that and then folks should yeah but you'd expect your dentist to say oral health is really important but it does lead to all kinds of other issues if you don't take care of your mouth\nAbsolutely absolutely there's so much that she can learn actually from from your mouth are so many correlations between bacteria in the mouth or for pregnant women for early bird for\nUm for lots of chronic diseases so I think there's there's we're just at the tip of the iceberg of really understanding how all of these different ... systems in our body um interact and if\nWe don't need to wait until we're sick and go to hospitals which is kind of a paradigm that we live in today for health care if we can really start to take more control of our of our health in our everyday lives at home but you start to see already with the ... trend with the quantified self or what people are doing with was trackers\nLet we're just at that at the beginning of that it's it's not just about running it's not just about activity tracking um it's it's how do we start to connect the dots\nOn every single part of a skin insights into a deeper health connection whether it's our skin our mouth our blood or heart um are sleeping patterns just to name a few\nThen if we can talk to bring all that in a meaningful actionable way we can actually pro actively work together with doctors with health care system to try to keep us healthier and and and decrease the need for for for hospitalizations\nWith regard to Nazis or getting a scape patches and Latin America and the middle east bit Odessa actually exist\nYes it did now I don't know whether they call themselves or death or not but the set up a was um that the they used the two letters S. S. because of a of handler\nAnd what they did was they said this apparatus and you ask the question was what surprised you shut up this apparatus and they have tons of gold and tons of looted cash\nA and they have assassins\nWorking for them and and the ... the organization had a rat line what Martin new garden I called the rat line from Germany to Italy general way Italy where they got these ss guys down there and put them on boats and then they went where they win most of them to Argentina where the parole and government was bribed\nTo allow them in and to keep them they're protected\nSo they're Red Cross out of Switzerland help BSS so did the F a beginning CIA\nAnd soda elements of the Catholic Church and I'm Catholic so all of that surprised me and we documented pretty thoroughly in the book and then the track down um you would think that the Israeli government would really want to get these guys in the beginning they did not\nAnd they didn't want to reopen this and they wanted to concentrate on protecting the new state of Israel from the Arab threat and they had to be badgered into tracking down I meant and manga law and the others that surprised us and then there's you know surprise is all across the book individual stories that we tell\nSo let me ask you you I Love the fact that you have a preoccupation with evil says than me my story since I was in high school so I I asked a Holocaust survivor men went through outfits the rabbi Leon Reza ... passed away\nAnd I I was with him for many many years and I I finally interviewed him and I asked him how does he how did he explain the ss guards in the camps and their savings him\nAnd he used the phrase that I have kept in my mind ever since it's the ... the one thing that I truly remember from my interview and he said they were monsters with human faces do you subscribe to that theory [noise]\n... ... s S. people didn't go to hell university and they and they warrant people who were uh in prison for violent crimes they were farmers shopkeepers lawyers\nWho before World War two live normal lives you saw him in the cafes you wave that I'm there all of a sudden the war starts when they sign up they get a black uniform in a death sentence ... to put on her cap\nThey walk into our with another camps and they brutalized people to the extent that modern civilization is never seen they kill babies they gas when they do the most heinous evil things that anyone could imagine [noise] and then after the war they go back to the towns\nAnd they take up their farming again\nIt's unbelievable and that's why I wanted to tell everyone who reads the book and every one that I Do these interviews with that evil exists in every person\nAnd you have to fight it you have to actively fight it or it can envelop you and if there's anything from killing the ss that's it\nFrom quiet because I'm I'm thinking and because of money for you to think about that [noise] ah so let me tell you something that I still audiences and I have my whole life the difference between my religious education in a regular secular education\nI was taught that my biggest problem in life is that as per acre in secular life there talk that their biggest problem\nIs America and that's a very big difference when you learn to fight yourself or your word to fight your society\n[noise] Americans are being misled\nPrimarily for political reasons about the true nature of even I'm going to give you an example that everybody will be able to respond to and it's very short [noise] the Kavanaugh hearings were ultra disturbing to me and millions of Americans because we saw an attempt\nTo destroy a human being and his family\nOkay now I don't know what happened I don't know Christine Ford\nI listen to her I never disparaged her

welcome back to I Hope it's walking back to the show\nAnd I have been hearing the trip tremendously interesting interviews and in ... burst amongst those interviews has been my reading to you from a column and then I Will go to a second column in the Washington Post they have a feminist column\nIn the Washington Post where are women the word feminist or or ... I think in particular the feminist columnist writes and I was reading some of them on the plane last night\nAnd I I shared some of them with you about some of the quotes\nI think that these are so important to wonder staying the damage that feminism an image it each make believe world ... old is it means that emanates from the left or make believe socialism is make believe\nAnd feminism is make believe you ... is make believe it's all make believe for whatever reason and it's all psychological it ... it's there's no other explanation there is a beep beep beep\nOr\nUnhappiness maladaptive ... to reality on the part of the people who embrace these things and certainly those who developed them they have contempt for the world as is conservatives understand that the chance of making the world's worst\nOr is the chances of making the world worse or at least as good as far as making the world better when you have a revolutionary idea\nMaking the world incrementally better is spectacular that's what we should be doing in every generation\nBut overthrowing the foundational ideas of a society because you have a dream of something better which is one character respects the character respectable I remember from the boat to fundamentally transform the United states of America that's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen\nShe writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing her main deliberately 'cause I have no desire to uh I'm not a leftist I have no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she is she they're interchangeable they have feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left\nAbove it is interesting that there's no mention in any of the columns by her or older women writing this column in the Washington Post that may be part of the solution to their loneliness and she says I have never been so lonely you to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the the word marriage is not even enter she's a she is divorced if I'm not mistaken a buck cheat the there's no mention of of marriage so she wants to wish racial loneliness we've relationship\nOr even an unappealing\nTemporary fleeing would appear from what I'm reading\nThe divide between men and women is never felt so why am I have never been so lonely too what does she described that I Know what I describe it to\nAnd then she writes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours\nAnd he kept saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted to eat lunch he said whatever you're comfortable with and now I read to read from her over the course of three hours that while I became his ... tribute she didn't like that\nAnd then what I even not only put in bold for myself but underlined what it was time to part ways\nI was comfortable giving him a platonic hug it was not sexy being the woman the driver seat for three hours so if the man is it the driver CDs of patriarchal guy and\nA probably a somewhat of a massage or this and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find it sexy well and then she wonders why she has never been so lonely in her life because what the feminist like all much this living to make believe world\nReality it is is awful and then they have an imaginary world were things will be better so she says if the demand is a dominant decision maker that's a glaring red flag that's what she writes after she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with\nI don't need a man she said to ask permission for every move he makes about of course that is exactly the way young men are taught today you have to ask permission for every move you make\nWe shouldn't let the battle cry of consent translate into boring sex see this is they they just said that they want their cake and eat it is like it's so trite they want to change the world into some imaginary things that can't exist\nIntentions are important in every one's intentions during sex should be of care healing and belief not personal appetite and blind conquest you're going to move personal appetite from sex all the good obese care healing and relief sounds like a visit to\nA social worker or therapist okay now I read to you from another one\nBy different feminist and also in the Washington Post this one is from October fifth do you know where your date stands on Brett Kavanaugh you showed\nSo she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first dates but now it's inevitable that she wants to know where they stand on Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup I told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox okay listen to this has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh disrupt the title but listen to this again\nI told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself from the emotional rooms that dating and relationships and memorably can bring\n\nDid you hear that this is a grown woman\nTheir children left his two children that horse they don't want to grow up\nI Want to be open to love but I Want to protect myself from the emotional boots that dating relationships inevitably can bring why don't you say that about anything else I'm open to working but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that\nWorking for a living can bring\nI Want to live fully but I Want to protect myself from the emotional wounds that life it never the bleak can bring\nI told you there children there was no exception leftists are at heart the children they do not want it to grow up growing up\nMeans pacing reality being prepared for her that's the reason for safe rooms at all of
