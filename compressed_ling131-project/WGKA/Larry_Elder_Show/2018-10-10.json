I was one of the most expensive house race and then they are now running again I think when you look at people on in the Bible and it can get one for anything had\nHappened to you know come out quite there is no debate and we don't have the five minutes away it's like he's already found ... and it's kind of like\nWow you know\nI'm not quite sure what she's talking about what he said about monkey\nAgain would you and I of course not well here's the deal male we cannot go down the road of nonstop political correctness\nAnd people are going to demagogue would just say like that's just unfortunately where we're at in this in this country the voters though they know that this is a non nothing burger and so I'm going to continue going forward just speaking the truth uh but I'm not going to be derailed by these fake controversies\nNow here's an article by a man named Matthew Chapman don't know who he is headlined GOP candidate wrote a book arguing the founding fathers were right not to abolish slavery\nAnd he's talking about Rhonda status around a standard wrote a book called dreams from our founding fathers first principles in the age of Obama and that's a take off from Obama's book dreams for my father\nQuote one of the most disturbing claims he made in the book was that Thurgood Marshall the first African American Supreme Court justice was wrong to suggest the founding fathers failure to abolish slavery in the constitution was a fundamental flaw\nIf the standard is simply left it at tolerating slavery was a central to get the southern states on board she might have had a point but the claim that the constitution somehow preordained at the end of slavery as written is pure whitewashing given that it took a bloody civil war\nTo do so\nAnd he talks about the three this deal that was made between the north in the south\nAnd how reprehensible that deal was another person who appears to be pretty ignorant about history is an article by Walter Williams called slavery quote\nAt the time of the Seventeen eighty seven\nConstitutional convention slave for about forty percent of the population of some southern colonies\nHe talks about how the southerners want it to ... count east late as one person in order to increase their representation in the north because they want it to limit the power of a slave holding ... states wanted them to have to count them at all till they agreed on telling them as three fifths as a compromise\nQuote many criticize writes Walter Williams this compromise as proof of racism which is what this guy said about round is that is my\nQuestion to these grossly uninformed critics is whether they would have found it more preferable for slaves to be counted as whole person's slave counted this whole person would have given slave holding southern states much more political power\nOr which critics of the founders prefer that the northern delegates not compromise and not allow slaves to be counted at all if they did it is likely that the constitution would not have been ratified that's the question the emerges whether blacks would have been better off with northern states having gone their way\nAnd southern states having gone there's resulting in no U.S Constitution and no union\nAnd then walked Williams quote Patrick Henry who's head of this three fifths compromise quote as much as I deplore slavery I see that prudence forbids its abolition of quote\nOne of the delegates Jane will strings Wilson said this about the compromise\nThat it laid the foundation for vanishing slavery out of this country and of quote is also a website maintained by the federal government called constitution Centre dot org\nAnd talks about the three fifths deal quote in truth it was a political deal that many delicate felt was essential to preserving the union the Madison was a slave owner he felt deeply conflicted about slavery\nBut he was a strong advocate of the constitution so we felt obligated to defend even the three this rule close quote what this guy criticizing Rhonda status is saying is that the Sanders was wrong when you said that free for compromise with the central uh and that the\nStates have been set for the eventual abolition of slavery\nThis guy is not true and therefore around us that is most apparently be racist oh my goodness\n[noise] Rhonda Sanders has called out the double standard all these anti Semite that are surrounding his uh his opponent\nThey always just like the weather channel that guys out there doing the things that\nAnd then the people are walking by like I was like oh it's ten to create a narrative you do not do that with Andrew Gillum have us Andrew Gillum why he had\nHair the council of American Islamic Relations to Tallahassee and twenty five votes to welcome them they were an uninvited co conspirator in the holy land foundation terror financing from the largest Sarah financing from history the welcome them he thanked them for what they were doing why were

to talk about American flaws and suggested the Ferguson was a microcosm of it\nObama's attorney general Eric Holder said when it comes to matters of race America has been a nation of cowards close quote\nAnd he said that there were a America right now or is involved in ... racism ... examples says the push for voting rights with a push for for photo voter id was an example of pernicious racism never mind the majority of blacks want\nPhoto voter id\nPayments that are as another example of pernicious racism the fact that black boys are expelled or suspended from school and a greater percentage than the other kids in that particular school\nHave a a Jesse Jackson even food an all white school board in Decatur, Illinois for kicking out a bunch of black kids that were fighting after football game you argue that the all white um school board\nWas racist a and that the policy that apply to these black boys was racist\nDecatur defended himself by pointing out all around the country where the school board is all white or school board are conducting a poll people of color clothes for back black boys are still kicked out disproportionately compared to other boys at that given given school why because they're misbehaving\nThe third example that are Eric Holder gave as an example of conditions racism or is the fact that a black\nCriminal defendant who commit the same crime as a white criminal defendant gets longer sentence and that is true\nWhat Eric Holder didn't tell you is that the U.S in the commission or that came up with that with that that also said the reason is for is the fact that judges\nOr when it comes to sentencing will take into consideration the defendants arrest record and it turns out that a typical black the Senate has a longer arrest record than typical white defend it as a result that black defend it gets a longer sentence nothing to do with racism or the U.S sentencing commission says that the\nJudges are taking into consideration

to do a ... for the state of Israel\nUm brawl freedom loving people but again I Want to get your reaction to up\nNikki Haley's announcement that she's going to be leaving at the end of the year I Know she's been a very good friend of yours and a very good friend of Israel\nAnd by friday Bert according to score political ... if you were a lot of weight\nAnd if you were the other way to be ... so they will come ... which I have the period and I think we all the way that is if you got to stick on your job the circle or President Trump over their new ambassador though it will continue to be on the ... what we do that by federal Hayley\nYou've ordered only about protecting either the security costs are by between all of those ...\nAbout passing ... example condemning come up in the general assembly\nAnd putting out the window I got us all all all those great new computers within ... step in\nThe you mentioned something ambassador I think it's important for people understand that says you know what it's like being the only person in the room and so does she want to explain that a little bit for audience\nThree losing Vassar\nAnd we have All right so one of the things he did say was that this idea of alone in the room and yeah that was your world condemnation against you there\nAnd the U.S really unwilling to take a stand uh to speak clearly a for\nIsrael I mean yeah they were reluctantly do it and honestly the Obama administration's we send those final days was going to be very uh a dangerous and they were I mean they they allowed those resolutions to move forward Israel was Standing Alone\nAt the un and the Obama administration's final day that they need the we talked about Harry this ship that took place between the the way it was in the way it is now um\nThis was a major shift that it really it it can happen in pretty record time when you think about it\nYes it happened very quickly very expeditiously or an itch approves one thing that Nikki Haley will indeed be a tough act to follow\nUm she was a leader in withdrawing a U.S funding from UN agencies that were indeed corrupt\nAh we also with drew for for instance\nFrom the un human rights Council on her watch and so we must continue to push such agencies to either change or they're too or alternatively collapse from a like a bunch\nAmbassadors let me ask you this ... ... when you think of the legacy of Nikki Haley as a U.S ambassador to pass through the United nations what do you think was the most significant or the if you were going to go through a couple of what do you think the most significant achievements were [noise]\nWhat I think the ... series they read the ball when you look at the sanctions against North Korea or the way that you\nNever lose or losing revel a technical problem uh getting ambassador noted but now the UN didn't North Korea was another when we talk about the middle east but the north Korea was another one yeah I mean again\nA very key very she ... here that are that even the best served from Israel see always talking about how the ... who said it wasn't just about Israel um and obviously their interests he was he represents\nBut what the US was doing it on the on on other issues as well\nVery significant ... so I think we played it before ... since we had trouble ah getting an ambassador live with the seas moving around our response but he had this to say about Nikki Haley set aside the record take a listen\nWhen you look at that the U.S to be creative after\nStanding on the U.S even at the front of the place people respect the U.S today in the UN because they matter a lot of ... to stand firmly even when he demand that she was in the minority even when we lose the votes she was the other way and I think that that you got that respect for many calories in his duty console in the general assembly\nIn that important because if you want to be relevant and if people to respect you at the un and international community and today I mean more respect so that by the end of the United states to that station and he thinks America stronger today\nSo thin looking at let's look ahead here because you have to look ahead I mean you know the best way a little stay for basically ten more weeks\nAnd then we're going in that time period we're going to have a new nominee I expect there's going to be a fight no matter who it is um because they're going to be supporting the president's position and there's forty eight senators that won't\nYeah the the president's taken a very aggressive position in foreign policy was needed Jamie we needed a dramatic shift in foreign policy specifically at the United nations and looked at is going to generate a lot of opposition inside the United States Senate and it will be a fight I suspect it's a fight\nOr that President Trump in the new nominee will win but I Do think it will be a fight and I I think it was so important that ambassador to known mention North Korea 'cause he's the Israeli ambassador and yet he sees that\nAs one of the main agenda items I also loved the fact that he references sometimes the new ambassador is going to have to be the only voice in the room would tell you a couple of things first of all sometimes that's absolutely literally I mean it takes a single veto on the Security Council you've got to be willing to stand alone\nAnd then sometimes while it might not be the only voice the new ambassadors going to have to be prepared when mass countries a stand up and walked down the advanced the proper ... they do the next ambassador has to be willing to stand for him and that type of situation well she had a certain\nBoldness Harry that I'm a Duke and I would say grab a toss\nAnd when we were with her and and then once you are an action I mean I met her book on a in a large sitting at the U.N General assembly we're both made an address uh but I've also been ... you know at the at the White House from time to time I've seen her and uh she just has a tremendous residents\nAbsolutely and so I Would add she also was a clear and direct speaker you knew where the United states stood on a particular issue when Nikki Haley spoke\nA in other words she did not hide our goals our objectives and our willingness to impose consequences both on the un\nStopped by hammering out there who's got a hammer well where's the hammer or is it are they are going
