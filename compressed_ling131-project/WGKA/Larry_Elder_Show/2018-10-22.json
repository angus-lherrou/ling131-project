stone Arizona on Monday and Tuesday broadcasting from that living breathing history museum that's what tombstone is\nSo we'll talk a little bit about that tonight with my upcoming guests you'll find them fascinating we'll go to them just a minute but I Want to throw that disclaimer out that I'm going to run that our\nFrom Tucson from tombstone Monday show because I had just an amazing conversation with them there and with gored there's some big things going on in tombstone relative to your right to keep and bear arms they're thinking big out there I'll tell you about it in just a little bit\nSo enjoy that third our as I bring it to this monster cast I Want you to hear it\nOn this giant enormous show and two hundred affiliates that don't get to hear the daytime show you're going to love so let me start with why was I in Arizona to begin with\nThe Arizona citizens defensively [noise] excuse me they asked me to speak I have three or four times now I I I've lost count\nBut I Love speaking of that event each year I'm a life member now so here's kind of my progression of my speaking relationship with the folks out at Arizona citizens eventually I actually woke up in tombstone Arizona number of years ago put my genes on brought a shirt strapped on a firearm\nPut my stepson on put my fry boots on\nStuck a gun on my hip and drove to Tucson to speak to the Arizona citizens defensively meeting and I thought that was kind of cool when it dawned on me man I woke up in tombstone Arizona today put my boots my ... my gun on\nIt came up here to Tucson to speak to\nOne of the greatest pro gun rights organizations grassroots organizations in the country I thought that was kind of cool to me that school stuff because I Love Arizona and I put you in particular I Love tombstone truck thought that was it but I was a basic member of the organization at that time card carrying\nThe next year I spoke as a sustaining member in Phoenix and then a couple of years later this year\nI speak as a life member and I couldn't be more proud of that fact\nSo this year\nI Am Alan Gottlieb and who you hear on the program founder of the second amendment foundation usually hear around every week out and I'd been planning a personal trip the tombstone for just a couple of days to get out what turns out\nThat Gordon Anderson who we met in shots show in Vegas a couple of years ago invited us out along with the mayor of tombstone\nTo assist them with and appear at their freedom day celebration in honor of their proclamation of America's first proclaimed official Second Amendment city\nBut it happened kind of quick and both of us were unable to get out there in June for personal reasons so we came out there this past week\nNow we had already pre planned this trip\nSo it was an awful lot of fun to pop into town Allen an eye on Monday we stayed until Tuesday we brought to live armed American radio daily shows from that living breathing history museum I've also broadcasted from tombstone in the past the number of years about four years ago as well\nSo we were there for a number of reasons not just the history in the front of the town but we were working both days in fact Allen pen to USA Today op ed piece from malaria motel and assisted me a production of both radio program so not all play I can assure used a lot of work going on\nBut here's the fun part and you're going to hear this and the third our today as I bring you the actual daily program for Monday This week from tombstone where my first guest was the tombstone their\nDustin ask a pool who unbeknownst to Alan ... even myself prior to the program presented each of us with an honorary citizen of tombstone plaque\nAlong with two golden keys to the city now again if you know anything about me that's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me because I've been going up the tombstone for twenty five plus years so to have that to me was an absolute incredible honor I had no idea that he was going to do that\nAnd it took both of us by surprise I have that plaque sitting right here and I can promise you that's the coolest thing and I have a lot of cool things on the wall in Studio ... problems from NASCAR stuff done stuff\nTo this this right here ranks right up there AS number one or at least tied for number one\n[noise] but I got to tell you what were we doing there why were we there because we're beginning assisting that incredible little town with their upcoming freedom day celebration in June of twenty Nineteen next year where I can promise you will be there\nThey're thinking big into stone and they want our help and we are more than happy to assist them and we will be bringing some big names to that town in June I Can't give you the list who's who yet\nAs it's building and we've got to reach out to a number of people but let's just say there will be a number of huge national celebrity figures as are expected to be out there pro gun rights celebrities yeah hard to find right but they're out there some of them made movies that you might be familiar with like ... tombstone you know that kind of stuff\nIn fact right now Val Kilmer is into zone as I speak to you right now he got into town today we're hopeful that maybe we can bring him back again\nIn June he's been there before but the list is building for movie stars to talk radio host that you listen to and see on national TV politicians newsmakers\nSo it's going to be a giant enormous event in tombstone and we want you to make the pilgrimage with us there will be more on that over upcoming shows a months as we get closer to ... to believe me just got to be on your like that just going to happen\nSo we'll have more on this throughout the year but suffice to say you'll hear a lot about it\nIn the third our specifics about it\nAs I talked to two of the city of tombstone movers and shakers Mr Gordon Anderson and their Dustin ... who by the way that the conversation with him was just fascinated his family history you know he's going to tell you about it in the third our but it is just extremely cool one of the victims\nKilled by the earth's at the gunfight at the OK Corral had eighty dollars in his pocket given to him\nBy the ... great grandfather for payments earlier that day that's the kind of cool stuff I'm Talking about the\nI Love that stuff so it's a ton of fun you don't want to miss the show if you've heard it if you heard it on Monday This week or or any of the hundreds of thousands upon gas listeners enjoyed the encore remembering that the vast majority of this huge weekend monster cast audience is tasting it for the first time okay\nComing up in the second hour for Breitbart News award winning journalist and a our weekly contributor and political analyst the one and only Dr Ray W. R. Hawkins is going to be here after a week long furlough as we brought you the program from Phoenix he was in California couldn't make the show\nNo big deal he's going to catch us up on all things

family\nYou know that's that's true that's very true statement we're surrounded we've got it right where we wanted we know right where they are\nAt you know and and that's and that's pretty much how I

stuff but\nWe're fighting our way out of this no doubt about it we are going to win because I Know you feel like I Do Johnny freedom will always prevail it might be one hell of a battle\nOr a number

broadcast a you know if you're watching us live it's new to east coast I'm ... died in some networks we ... you get a delayed\nBut we think long and hard about what topics they hit and we decided today you know there'll be plenty of time talking about some of the other issues but I thought today was worthwhile to take to really focus on us because I think it was a major speech that the president gave\nGive it will go with the order now who is called ... who's been old dodge John and Minnesota on line three John welcome to Jay sexual alive I joined\nA group called ... go ahead with your comment\nSo I I have a choice the says the present and see what you think of it um I've been around a difficult time getting old a past middle age but I really believe that but\nAnyway I'm\nI'm mentally also which means I'm sixty two so I guess I Lived through Adrian and when they come up to about a hundred and four that'd be good okay oh\nI see a lot of cousins come and go there was quite and they have all these interesting combinations of or that Bush is the master\nLot of great writing about that but with Donald Trump I just wanted to ask you what you think of this I think in two years less than two years directly through his term that he's done so many great things that you got to put him on the list of what other great presidents already so I just want to hear your comments\nI wanted to play something and I think sums it right up I think you you're absolutely correct but let me play this for you number sixty two\nMoving forward we're only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and frankly\nFriends and we expect other countries to pay their fair share [noise]\nFor the cost of their defense\nI think that says it all I think that sums it all up by big that's exactly the right approach and that's exactly another doctrine that the president's laid out here All right yeah back to the phones we go pet\nIn Florida on line to pat welcome to Jay Sekulow live like that\nGuy studying at everything is a great show as always thanks um my question is first day and if he's still there he is just wandering but I'm just wondering if there's any reaction to that he might have her to the president's speech show up on the hill\nGo ahead and\nYeah I think there's going to be some handwringing in some uh ... not just going to be on the left because the president did something that they had been unwilling to do for a number of years\nAnd that is old these un programs accountable for what is required them under us debt you look we have long called on Congress to poll funding ... some of these accounts that are not following statutory authority or the president has taken that into his own hand as he has the authority to do the J Congress should have done it long ago so I suspect\nThere might be silence from some quarters you would normally expect support but it's because they've been sitting on their hands and not doing with the president\nYou know what's also interesting on this John is that if you look at the commentary that's come out since the speech believe me if there was one line they could have jumped on and taken all the way home and said I Can't believe the president said that they would have done it so far I have not seen that\nNo no in fact that the media has again they covered the speech but they've shifted back to the other more salacious there's they ... they can do and I do think that's a testament to the speech itself yeah because I get this was a speech primarily to the international audience\nRecovery view because it does impact the United states obviously but you're talking to the entire world this is not a rally speech\nA at a target for the U.S\nA un American voter it's it's targeted to the world and world leaders more specifically I'm very broadly the entire world so I think that they they have nothing to seize on here\nThere's no mobile of serious disagreements and so because of that instead of spending like we've done at a time actually analyzing the speech they're moving on to the media because it's just there's nothing there's nothing to debate parents of either like this I don't like this\nYou know what do you think it tells us that the reaction so far has been buried tap it I mean I Would say that but I mean they're not usually they're attacking and you don't see it right now\nAbsolutely so I think part of their ... action or lack of reaction is a reflection of the fact that President Trump gave a very principled speech\nRespect our interest that's number one number two fairness in international affairs including a trade is require\nA and number three this worse effect of American interests comes with a cost that was a clear an unmistakable message that was delivered by the president there were no missteps\nAnd clearly I think the president of cheat you achieved his objective in offering this speech\nAt the United nations and as Jordan said earlier the president's rhetoric now has more weight why because the president has followed up prior rhetoric with what action and that counts for a lot\nThan as arguing represented you go to the un you've been there many times are bad usually and ... people being held captive for their fate what is your sense of Capitol Hill reaction are we seeing anything yet so far\nAre not a whole lot J I think still digesting the speech but I think here's what you're gonna here and this is this is certainly would I took away from it for the first time in a long time J I heard a balanced approach with the United nations that said two things that might seem\nTo be in contradiction each other but actually work in harmony on the one hand you heard the president say we're not going to meddle in your business miniature sovereign a right to engage in an issue but on the other hand Jay he said we're not going to be the world's pocket book so we're not going to find every little program around the world that might not serve America's\n... more of your calls are more Facebook questions well as well outlets going to take another call it back to the phones we go John in Washington state on line
