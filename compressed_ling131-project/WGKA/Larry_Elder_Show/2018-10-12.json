think maybe that's what they see in each other they both think they trends in their industries\nThey both think they transcend politics so maybe they have a connection over there I don't know if anything except that there's going to come out of this but I Know this President Trump has advisors who say sir or we have a very low approval rating among African Americans what are we going to do about it so the\nOnly sensible analysis in the last four minutes\nThey go out and they talk about the low unemployment which he did he played that clip you got a very a well known African American

Tripoli\nSo we've just we've just got a total mad and uh you know it's become it's a big scandal that even the Democratic controlled California is somewhat of a scandal that\nUh you know again the DMV insist that are no illegal residents voted or whatever but you know it's really hard to uh it's really hard to trust trust what they're doing and this comes against a backdrop of you know with the ... id law\nWhich is the federal law mandating you know new driver's licenses that where people provide a you know a information so that the security on airplanes\nWe've got these enormous backlogs\nAnd the DMV he's had these huge commercial license backlogs of the drivers we'd go through school they get they get a job and then it would take months for them to get a commercial license just because

because of his Christian faith after a working as a Christian pastor in Turkey for twenty three years I knew the issue at all\nRaising his family their three children who wait a their father as fathers return to the United states um he has been released after this two year a horrible ordeal and\nI Know it's been in the news a lot a day but I always want to make sure people tune in and out of radio broadcasts that they know or the emergence of law and justice represented the Bronx and saying we continue to do so there's a lot worked there remains to be done\nUm as as we air right now he's not yet left turkey I'm a for somebody who hear the broadcasts at different times that may have changed uh but uh but again I he has been free by the court a and a and his passport returned ankle bracelet being taken off because he was under house arrest\nAnd uh and ultimately ... return to the United states may uh will likely stopped a ... at a military US military base in Germany I'm a which

White House has been members of Congress have been in fact let me play\nSenator Lindsey Graham ah who is on a this is a on a TV this morning about a pastor Brunson he's played a key role listen to what he did on behalf of pastor Brunson\nThat's been too long years is to kill\nA toddler person or a wind up about it directly at our relationship things to improve it is certainly a great step toward\nPresident Trump and buys first pets have been all over this and ... and tell us a shade pushing very hard for a long time [noise]\nWhen he gets home I'll feel better but he's not on there\nAnd I think again that is that everybody obviously you feel that way too is that you want to alternately see this a hundred percent completed and that is to be that's kind of leaving Turkish airspace you're at that military base or whether that's a Germany to US military base I stay in these members of Congress like Lindsey Graham said they they\nPlayed a key role even go as far as uh not just using their contacts to me with the president turkey but also to go right into the prison to meet with pastor Brunson\nYeah far more than just issued a statement or giving his speech tournament several members of the house and Senate went over to turkey\nOr to visit with a pastor Brunson also to visit with officials I mean do you think about senator till assume senator she he knew a huge their seats in the Senate Armed Services Committee or to raise this issue Jordan so\nYou know they they injected it into a conversation about defense programs that they cared an awful lot about and we're willing to take a human rights case like pastor Brunson into that debate and it really did put a leverage into the situation and again\nI Want to cast it in this lady was not you know leverage that was looking to push turkey away in fact\nUh I think Senator Graham said it very well he wants a strong relationship with turkey he wants turkey in the United states to have a positive relationship and he was very careful and directing communicating to his Turkish colleagues uh this this release a pastor Brunson was going to be necessary for that relationship\nTo be as healthy as he would like it to be so again\nA senator Lankford senator tell US Senator Shaheen Senator Graham and many others Jordan did weigh more than ... speak out about this they made it a priority for them and they spent hours and hours and hours are working on the case\nOr let me go to Pam calling Oklahoma on line one and if you support and called the take right now Pam welcome to Jay sexual

bit I just you know I think you heard what Senator Graham says they'll feel a whole lot better you continue to pray I said you know you do you prefer this family even after he's back in the United states\nBecause of the process how horrible of a process this has been on for the family this is tough um it takes a mental toll it takes a physical toll as health is a bit it issue and that's why he was ultimately allowed house arrest was because of his health so it takes all the different kinds of physical mental or emotional and psychological tolls\nA suit continue to pray for the family obviously you could celebrate what is a tremendous victory in a great moment to see pastor Brunson are in prison because of his Christian faith and ultimately released today in Turkey take a listen this is\nA shows the bipartisanship here said mentioned senator Jeanne Shaheen a Democrat a sitter she'd also spoke out this morning take a listen\nI Am a trail and that really aren't I applied for it at so many people who have been involved in making that path and first of all the advocate the\nWife and family they have been so critical and making the case that he never should have been
