running on this idea that Democrats are are at the Democrats intend to end the judge Kavanaugh as the way to keep the enthusiasm about the nomination in ...\nIs it realistic to expect an investigation that could potentially end with impeachment\nProceeding calving off they get control of the house possibly looking at impeachment uh what do you make of those pledges there will be an attempt to impeach a justice capital\nI think that it said they would you support the house investigation at the start for an impeachment vote and to judge capping off\nDemocrats could launch impeachment

and the Senate threw him off the bench\nAnd then he ran for Congress played the race card and there he said as we speak now getting back to CNN and the trashing Kanye West the rocky sellers is a democratic strategist why isn't the comment he just now made bigoted\nI'm not sure he's using that as a ... per se but what Kanye West of done with Donald Trump is what other people have done who gravitated in his in his orbit which is just\nShower him with adulation for what reason I have no idea um but the my issue with Kanye West as it's quite simple um is that anti intellectualism simply isn't cool and Kanye West these issues as you say to these issues that they're going to talk about our our issues that are that are\nCentral issues and many African American communities are very important issues\nBut the fact is we're not sending Kanye West of the White House to talk about these issues because he can't he doesn't have the depth to um I Want to hear what Kanye West wants to do when we're talking about criminal justice reform or prisoner reentry the fact that he cannot he doesn't have that that just the other day\nHe was talking about a spin programs and how we needed to

be right back in service that\nYou tell us when we\nCome back to recall some squares off within legal avenue says yeah the number might be twenty two million according to the study they all should be\nGiven a pathway to citizenship why because Ninety percent of are going to vote for Democrats for the other way around the border would be field [noise] harder than the clans behind I'm Larry\nIf they settled population and obviously we're not going to count every one so there's definitely a and on the couch\nAnd three most importantly is simply want to be okay on either way it's ... million if let's say I'll just send a rebel movie ... stop please I sign in politics I read this study\nIt's pretty clear they're the first people to look at the systematically and are far more than ... million people in this country illegally the largest margin in the history of presidential elections in this country like any for was about Seventeen million\nSo they're more illegal aliens and there are voters who made the difference in the biggest blow out an American presidential history you're falling here with the map\nDefinitive so here I just want to know really quick if they're twenty two million twenty four million twenty million you want to give all of them citizenship and voting rights and he's still for the annual absolutely no way to look at the economy was doing that for the wall three point seven unemployment rate\nFor point to economic growth if we want to be able to do even better look if we had twenty two million on immigrant home now we're doing pretty well economically so I say that the citizenship that didn't make sure we will have it even better ... let's just talk about now what I saw that and so they're not paying\nWeight on your conceding that they're not paying taxes now I thought having talked to many times you're always was they're paying into the system more than they're taking out which I certainly ... we started on more taxes will ... will not wait wait wait citizens don't pay more taxes\nEverybody who works pays the taxes pays our tax rate\nSo you're conceding that a lot of these people edition of break our immigration all are breaking our tax law and they're using fake IDs\nI said now I only have a single ... million undocumented\nLet them pay taxes the eleven million on that and I thought I Would hate to act as I said more taxes\nSo if there is more ... than let let them pay more there is\nIs that going to have you on the show because it doesn't even make any sense at all I Will say eleven million on that immigrants any let let the eleven million pay taxes no very simple math I'm not saying anything complicated on what you're saying\nYour point is that illegal aliens are great they're better than us they pay their full tax share of have always always said that he's on the twenty times on my show us and now you're saying well if we if we give them the vote they'll pay more taxes what then I'm going to make that\nHere's the bottom line I just want to viewers to understand what the agenda of lunatics like us I mean that with all respect that I liked him personally but you're saying\nLunatics like you and I mean it was with all due respect\nTo millions brand new voters in our electorate okay out of nowhere here legally now they all get to vote that Ninety percent of we're going to vote for the Democrats [noise]

line three Julie welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nHigh turn it's always a pleasure to talk to and I'm so proud of that ... of\nA thank you so much we appreciate you\nOkay I'm In the house of representatives the way it is set up that it represents a number of persons that district instead of the number of citizens and\nUm most of the people who come to our country from different countries um vote Democrat\nUm slit seems to really becoming more and more difficult to get Republican majority in Congress and even a solid majority when you have so many people think representative who aren't even citizens of our country\nNot citizens they shouldn't be voting that swan so there are simply says the census goes out that takes account of the people and that's kind of have congressional districts are drawn up\nSomewhat and there's a lot of gerrymandering and things that go around but remember you have to be a citizen to vote if not your ...\nVoted so um it's not people who who are here who are not citizens that are are are voting in causing that Democrats to win a now I think that what you're getting at though the bigger issue is that the immigration issue\nA front and center in California you see this is why like taking the calls from all across the country than is because you get a call from Julie she's in Santa Monica California and clearly a feels a little bit deflated because a\nUs significant demographic changes coming even though people may not be citizens yet um and uh and California is one of the bluer states in the country but the Republicans do win in congressional races there\nBut just that it is I I just want to tell people ah don't worry about the fraud right now let the election lawyers for the political parties do that they are um especially the close races get out there and vote and get out there and get your friends to vote than that is what's important yeah that's right\nBut I was going to say to Jordan I mean look the census is not perfect the voter fraud issue is not perfect but I Will tell you this on both of those counts I think they are the best in the world so could there be improvement yes there absolutely good and they're constantly working on it but that really is the party apparatus job to focus on that as citizens\nYou should be etiquette educating your friends and family getting out to vote and then yes ah keeping an eye on those due process to use\nA majority if you look around the world I think you should be privileged to be a citizen of the United states and they have an opportunity to participate in this process\nYeah let's go back to the phones Chris in Nevada online five Chris welcome to Jay so you'll live\nHigh I cannot think of one in ... where a Republican went low and be a Democrat then went by what I've seen the Democrats go low and when that doesn't work they didn't do lower\nYeah I mean that's the more recent I think it's fair to say is that the civility has been tossed out the window um and uh and\nYou heard from Hillary Clinton that there will only be restored in her words if if Democrats take the house or the ... or both but without that no more stability and is Eric Holder former

D\nPrinting Trump's racist President Trump question whether or not Obama was from Hawaii therefore he's a racist never mind Hillary first one who started this oh yeah it's always campaign to\nShe's the one who started the birther movement and somehow her hands are completely clean fingerprints left anywhere nevermind her top management Sidney Blumenthal went to the McClatchy Newspapers\nThat an editor when public and said yeah he came to me and he told me that Obama is from Africa and we put a report on to track down the rumor turned out it wasn't true but but the Sunni Blumenthal absolutely ... said that to us he is from Africa\nSo here we started it and no one calls her a bigot because of it but Donald Trump because he picked it up is now bigger the Montreal over and over and over again isn't it that\nPresident Obama stirred up the racist based in the in the heart of American mostly American white males I guess and that's why Donald Trump got elected\nNever mind seven hundred counties I voted for bronco bombing two thousand eight in two thousand twelve of the seven hundred counties nevermind a two hundred switch to Donald Trump did they become racists\nDuring the years when a President Trump was in office and then they realize they were or are there racism go into recession by cancer I mean what what what what are you talking about why that couldn't be my problem\nThe city over one hundred that most voted for Donald Trump was ... eighty percent voted for President Trump\nGas which city just elected its first black mayor apple lane now explained to me how is it that Donald Trump got put into office by all these white racists\nWho's in turn around and voted for a black guy to be mayor of the city because the point is that white people are nervous about a country that's becoming increasingly your country of color and therefore they're panicking they want somebody in there to stop this when they want a Nazi in their right\nListen to what Chris Matthews who frequently makes the same argument I just found me deal\nHas conceded she doesn't realize what he said some of this\nBut I Do understand President Trump to it as much as any of us\nTalking about why it is that President Trump invited Kanye West into the oval office\nBut I Do understand President Trump is as much as any of us do he always shoot them\nHey there's the thing it does the thing and they get in the contest of ideas and politics that the other people don't do area sitting with a hip hop guy who apparently is it's got some sort of bizarre politics that Doug Fine I think it's also it's it's runs against the ideas and he's a racist it runs against the either in terms of like minorities that he's going after her Rona going after a\nMaxine Waters going after the usual suspects if you will and politics\nAnd it sort of a racial way and areas flipping the computers and people but mainly it's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist\nMost white people won't vote for a guy if they think he's a racist hey y'all why why God\nThat's the opposite of the narrative that you have been giving your colleagues have been giving your colleagues at CNN had been given for the last two years\n\nDonald Trump is a big nudge nudge wink wink and he's encourage all the white picket nudge nudge wink wink to vote for me because I'll keep the country white\nThat's ... that's the line with Don Lemon is basically said that's what Jake Tapper his essentially said Anderson Cooper said\nDumb and dumber instead of talking about the Don lemon and ah Chris squabble they said it\nYou say that is there much here you have somebody who's been saying this now admitting truth is and\nAnd I know why people says Chris Matthews I've been white all my life I hang around with a lot of white people so I Know I'm In a I got to tell yourself that got hit by a white people will vote for a black person and then he's a big it I I\nThat's the opposite of what you guys have been saying\nBut I Do understand President Trump is as much as any of us do he always shoot them\nHey there's the thing it does the thing and they get in a contest of ideas and politics than the other people don't do here is sitting with a hip hop guy who apparently is as got some sort of bizarre politics that Doug Fine I think it's also it's it's runs against the ideas and he's a racist\nIt runs against the either Trump like minorities that he's going after her Rona going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects if you will in politics\nAnd it's sort of a racial way and Harry is limited and confusing people but mainly it's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most of them if they think they're racist show of his show you're not in some plaintiffs\nCartoonish way you get some off the hook you know what I'm saying\nWhite people comment at least most of them comma won't vote for somebody if they think he's a racist\nIs this a game show um\nCruise doesn't that shoot a hole in your theory that the reason President Trump got elected he's because white racist rose up\nI might have any role in the short Georgia city or the ocean Iraq\nNever mind that Trump got a smaller percentage of the white vote than Mitt Romney never mind that Trump got a higher percentage of the black vote then did Mitt Romney higher percentage of the Asian vote then did Mitt Romney ... percent of the Hispanic vote than Mitt Romney\n... over at CNN and MSNBC ... hall has been through the last two years this is a
