hanging out with us how are you\nMight find good good you know we keep saying that uh the FBI does not come to conclusions they just record the activities of the accused\nHowever with Khomeini and investigating Hillary a came out with this big announcement that they've come to the conclusion that there was no no no prosecutor would bring charges against her go\nTo the point I mean it's you know it is I mean we have to remember that what this amounts to as a as a seven background check this is not the kind of FBI investigation or special Bob Mueller as special counsel dragging on and on and carrying on for this is a background investigation Mrs interviewing people putting in a report what they said\nFind that there's any cooperation looking at the corroborating witnesses talking to them and putting it in a report it given it to the Senate Judiciary committee that's all it is um and and that's I'm\nNot going to be satisfied anybody as we progress is I think but maybe it will be enough for some senators to vote yes including a couple of Democrats Chris welcome how are you crush\nI'm doing well my point I wanted to bring up was a personal one where\nMy mom was sexually assaulted in the worst matter and I won't use the word you can imagine what I'm Talking about or and or almost put a put away and murdered and um she she had something with me the other day but I talked to for it that really made a lot of sense she said\nThe testimony where she talks about going into the supermarket to say hello to um the accuser but one of the accuses that would never happen that would never happen my mother couldn't even go into a shopping mall for years and\nCould not to what she had to face the accuser in court and and in a line up\nYour she's not going to say Hi to the guy in a grocery not going to say Hi that they had to think about it why would you did you hear the bow Lindsey Graham whine about the the woman who claimed that she witnessed gang rapes going on at ten parties after the first one I think you'd go back nine more times you gotta if you're watching my ideas\nYeah lots of ... lots of questions on very reluctant to question the credibility of an accuser only because I'm mindful that said there's a million times there are lots of women who've been abused and sexually assaulted they had no cooperation and they were utterly alone\nThey lost their jobs they've lost their careers we've heard the stories and uh\nYou know you can't read these stories and hear about some of these accounts\nEven yesterday Jeff Flake was it some event in Boston We're gonna play some video and audio from that but uh that's why I think Jeff Flake is a is a no he's playing to the media is playing to his Democrat friends and there were a bunch of people standing in the front rows of whatever event he was at in Boston holding up signs saying I was a sexual assault survivor\nOr I'm a survivor or something like that and an honest to goodness I I I I feel great compassion for anybody who has been assaulted who's been attacked who has been um victimized and they got nowhere to go uh\nAnd and they work maybe in a in a ... that happened in the workplace and had a powerful man who did this to them and they got nowhere to go um in in but the problem is it's a double edged sword\nNow you you have a woman coming forward\nLate in the game because of the Democrats the eleventh hour making ... an accusation that has been countered by the passionate fiery response of of Brett Kavanaugh that makes people think that's exactly what I Would sound like if I were falsely accused\nPack your next step on the Mike Gallagher she'll get a lot of trying to get as many calls and as we can do they Hi Pat welcome how are you\nTwo quick questions that will make you like me and then I'm going to say something that's gonna make you hate\nOr like you already don't make me hate you come I yeah I yeah because you're going to yell at me I'm not going to jail and\nIt's a

out cheer glasses\nAre now you're going to hate hate you I'm like oh no this is what's gonna make you hate well All right we're not going hey I don't\nYeah you well you will um we have to remember that people are saying she has a Meryl Streep\nBut you we have to remember that Kavanaugh couldn't be Laurence Olivier because you have to remember he\nEven a even if he didn't remember which I think if it happened he doesn't remember it but if even if he did he's been taking a lion last or some of the best because he's been in court at a very high levels when they liars are not amateurs and he's

Love the way he tackles this and of course I Love his political boys let's welcome and I guess\nYou could watch our conversation at Mike online dot com or the great David Limbaugh Hey David great catch up with the again my friend how you been\n\nDoing it in a big fan of yours or do we should we broke up there at the very beginning and you're back there with me how are you yes really that uh that you hear me now now we can mount loud and clear how are you\nRight we've been friends a long time and I've been a fan of yours or ... ...\n... I've been a big fan of yours for a long time as you know I Hope your brother gets his radio career off the ground has that coming back to work on it I\nThink that I can you know than it really\nWell you know he's kinda he's kinda he's struggling but we've we've ... planetary we pray for him to first of all Jesus has risen can we talk a little bit about this crossroads this this ... to a position of\nPolitics as you so brilliantly delivering your columns and in your appearances on Fox News and all and your deep space for some people make some uncomfortable but frankly at at at times like these I think I think that cross roads that intersection of faith and culture and politics is perfectly timed\nYes you know it's so interesting we have a situation and I got a bad if I were your son and great though okay I took this fight that I the\nHolidays were living in a very definitely as we as I ... for the next city\nThe survival of this country and we have I Believe in a very effective president and Donald Trump though I didn't initially support I supported Ted Cruz I'd been with Trump ever since he won the primaries adamantly foreign we're facing let you know I I mean his purists conservative constitutional conservative and I am\nBut as I said on Sean Hannity's show last night that a fact let's conservatism is an infinite conservative right and we and we like Trump because he fights back and get things done and I think he's actually become a pretty strong ideological conservative he certainly in effect that one but we had the left\nOut of the woodwork trying to destroy him trying to destroy everything in his path including Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd they think they have a monopoly on morality and I think they they're worldview is so ... I'm Sorry to say it and I think it's self evident when you see I hate all they are how much they project how much they are exactly the opposite of what they claim to the I eat\nAs tolerant a loving their hate all their mob there they'll do anything to destroy people the end justifies the means\nAnd sell when when John Adams said\nThat the constitution is only going to be a war only going to work for a moral and religious people I think what he had in mind where people like the left who will destroy the court for example instead of upholding the constitution that legislate from the bench and it end justifies the means they'll do whatever they want to do\nAnd we have to fight back in Christian to say we can't fight back because we're not being Christian they're wrong we have a duty we're not just on this earth to sit here as bystanders we have a duty to try to preserve this culture\nFor our kids and for ourselves and what made America the greatest nation in the world and so I don't buy into this thing that we ought to be passive we ought to be active and work or but there's one other intersection and that is this is so controversial so contentious in our culture that I think sometimes we need\nSomething greater to let you and that that something greater in my view is Jesus Christ and so I think the books that I write on this subject are designed to get people in the Bible and reduce their intimidation and increase and accelerate their learning curve so that they will also\nBe more comfortable and going to read the Bible for itself and that's really my bill\nI'm grateful for your voice and I'm grateful for this book because we're living in a time you know David to those who are who call them ... who are conservatives\nAnd spiritual people who oppose President Trump with everything that with every fiber of there being because they don't like his tone they don't like his tweets they don't like his temperament they don't like the kind of person he is\nWe're seeing what the alternative would have been to Donald Trump or seen it all displayed right now with this capital debacle in all its glory the left is what we would have\nRunning things if it weren't for the election of Donald Trump\nLet me tell you note for words wherever spoken socialism\nAt least to destruction it leads to poverty and ultimately as high it talked about at least ... and you can see that as well you can see it in the in the left in the United states\nI said the other day on Twitter and I really mean this and I seem like a radical I seem unreasonable I see my hands when I say this I Am not I'm pretty mainstream I Believe that the ... the far left and sadly that's encompassing all to larger of\nA component of the Democratic party where I Would put us in re education camps if they could have many of them would I mean look at the things that are good they have no clue thoughts about destroying Brett Kavanaugh and his family and and they don't have any complaints\n... anyway I thought I understood radical I've I've read they've taken radical to new heights and it's and unfortunately the face of today's Democratic Party in many cases David\n... yes and my ... I think about what they're fighting for they are I'm Sorry if this offends people they are fighting for the right to twist the constitution into a pretzel so that it will\nAllow them illegally to continue to terminate destroy kill babies in the womb and they claim to have the moral high ground how sick is that\nPretty sick stuff and you know they admitted that\nOnce in a while you'll have a
