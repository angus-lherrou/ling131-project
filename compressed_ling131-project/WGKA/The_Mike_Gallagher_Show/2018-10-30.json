Sally winning by more than four because I I Do not believe for a second but it's close or after the um the\nCinema melt down I thought it was close until the cinema melt down but I just can't see Republicans walking even if they hate Donald Trump I just don't see them voting for Christian send them a she made herself electable\nSo the big test and this raises the sentiments would have remained herself consider this as moderate that figure even though she has a long a very well documented history of sort of anti war radicalism lunch when you're not even so the question is are voters gonna hold that against are they going to look at her more recent\nA record of every Congress woman I I think those uh instead of information and and all those recordings of her you know if they say in a lot of lot of pretty radical things back in the day is very damaging sort of sort of personal you know\nNot talk to be a little bit about the uh New Jersey race because Bob Menendez is in my view the Roy Moore of the Democratic party unacceptable to a wide swath of normal people as a bad guy or not people to possibly put Bob Hugin in the Senate\nSo if this was a normal in this was one of us leap year midterm election Bob and then this will be serious trouble probably would lose reelection but\nBecause New Jersey of all states very suburban state on work Donald Trump is not particularly popular to put it mildly a he's probably favorite you're going to survive in all likelihood just because of the blue wave in New Jersey it's hard\nTo see when you have an environment in a state that favors a party even at damage incumbent like Bob Menendez probably going to win by narrow margins unusual but he'll probably end up end up with one another and hugging is on a great campaign\nWallace had every right now I I think Kevin Cramer is put one in the Republican column and take away I think Josh ... but when the Republican column and take away but I don't I Know my son is they had been I don't know if it's take away yet and I think Rick Scott is tied or slightly behind margin of error is that your assessment\nThat's pretty much it misery and the one thing to watch is is there in Indiana Senate races were pulling away towards the Republicans in the last week you know Trump took a little bit of a hit a politically and ... and the last week I did want to look at those numbers against the Democrats have made some movement but\nLook these are conservative states Donald Trump them by double digits or his views on immigration how popular it in the states like Missouri in Indiana so I I generally think always a slight favorite in Missouri uh Mike Brown a slight favorite in Indiana certainly North Dakota as you mentioned is looking very favorable or the Republicans\nAnd those are the three top pickup opportunities Florida is not looking good for Republicans both the governor's race and in the Senate race still competitive but but I think Rick Scott as the underdog and ... and ... to starting to pull away from rockets and\nWhat's interesting is that day David Ross a pretty big and just published a Florida poll showing its at one point race in the Senate side done say about the governors ah the ... the United states has tweeted\nMe see\nIf the fed back soften starts talking a little more debate I think we're going to be right back to twenty eight hundred twenty I heard target rate we've had for the U.S and the five hundred that's a quota Scott ran Wells Fargo analyst that the president put out there\nClearly the president doesn't like the correction coming a week before the election but it might also bounce back to that you never at markets are markets Josh rush hour what do you think the impact of the market so\nYou always hear about the October surprise that maybe the November surprise me last week is has not been good for the White House but the the pipe bomb Malian horrible shooting in Pittsburgh if a synagogue and the stock market has I've lost another point in the last week this is not what kind of Trump wanted\nRight before the midterm election that's what we're hearing\nTalked about immigration and trying to tourists in such a birthright citizenship [noise] um so I you know like I I don't think a lot of lot of people's minds are locked in but again if if there's any party that has momentum in the final the Democrats do have a ...\nA you know I'm going to make one one correction to that I think there's a rebound against the left for going crazy at like Marsha Blackburn last thirty seconds to I just think the Julie I off on CNN Marsha Blackburn demonstrator Josh it makes people\nBreaking news at breakneck face this is Mike Gallagher show\nWe're not going to make America great again there was never that\nWe got a crucial midterm election coming up November ... since Nineteen Seventy eight Gallagher has been a voice of clarity for millions of America\nSingles oh\nWe'll just give a credit card even if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house endorsed sparkling ... started\nThe show owned by the most famous man on the planet\nAnd you've been great Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot coms studios Mike yeah like\n[noise] the biggest reasons just smiled\nToday you might hear all day\nNumber one the president of the United states is vowing to end birthright citizenship the insane practice of having\nSomeone come to this country have a baby and that baby immediately becomes a citizen for life enjoying all the benefits of citizenry president says that's ridiculous we're the only country in the world to do that\nAnd it's got to stop I liked that story very much today as we're one week out that's an important reminder of what's at stake because Democrats to a person will oppose the president ending birthright citizenship you and I know that\nHere's another thing to give you a reason to smile big headline in USA Today [noise] I don't often see headlines in USA Today that makes me smile but this one does this is above the fold as in today's paper and I quote fifty two hundred drop the troops to block\nCaravan fifty two groups to block the migrant caravan without a border we don't have a country\nSovereignty matters we have a president who is willing to say we're going to stop these thousands of illegals who are on this determine march for the United states towards the United states from coming in\nAnd Trump haters are in a fetal\nPosition because they know his position on illegal immigration which is what got him elected in the first place is resonating all across the land\nI had an interesting back and forth of my producer before the show today Lance Anderson who um was done at Steve Schmidt Steve Schmidt is McCain guy right Lance he's a long time Republican operative I'm pretty sure he ran McCain's campaign if I'm not mistaken\nAnd Steve Schmidt appeared on MSNBC he's never Trump Republican these never Trump British continue Jewish down they continue to amaze and Steve Schmidt\nSaid the following this is cut the number nine pounds later\nThis is what Steve Schmidt had to say about the president's position on protecting our border now this is important because it gets down to whether or not normal Americans expect us to have border security now for four years\nRepublicans have consistently favored border security had many Democrats due to this isn't really a ... a right left issue we have border security or we don't if you get thousands and thousands of illegals from Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador\nSome of whom we are discovering our ... children and are bringing drugs and all kinds of crime with them\nWell of course the military should be waiting for them of course we have to protect Texas and the United states and our country we have to secure the border it's illegal what they're going to try to do\nAnd yet listen to it never Trump or like Steve Schmidt a long time Republican operative on MSNBC and I'm going to tell you about the back and forth I had with Lance Anderson about these never Trump Republicans but first of all cut nine from MSNBC and gravy and here's what she had to say\nNever had a president of the United states to with this president as do I see is stoking a cold civil war in this country and it has turned hot\nOn the periphery this man ... hours what was he said was when he went and he said I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in and he went in to kill Jews\nTo Jews have believed that we're financing the caravan be invading army like a cancer division that is threatening the southern border ad army that is racking riddled with disease\nThe same type of rhetoric the same type of propaganda that you would have seen in Germany in Nineteen thirty eight that the human ... turning people into infested ...\nThat's a Republican operative named Steve Schmidt now ... point and and last was kind of a I\nI have to give them some credit because he was like ... just astounded at ... at the realization that these never Trump Republicans who were in positions\nOf of of managing campaigns and trying to help Republicans got elected last does take away was brilliant last said heck no wonder Republicans kept getting beat him people like Steve Schmidt running campaigns he's a Democrat\nAnd when Lance said that it it it it sure does spark jumped into my mind and I wanted to throw it out to you and I know we've spent too much time already probably on these these these these maddening never Trump hers\nBut is Lance right that the people we're seeing\nBill Kristol Jennifer Rubin Steve Schmidt you go down the list of never Trump Republicans\nAre they really Democrats at heart\nIn other words or they just now showing their true colors or did they flip\nBecause they hate Trump so much\nI don't I I tend to think it's the latter rather than the former I Believe they've flipped and they sound like Democrats because they hate Trump so much they can't believe that he's having so much success and so they got to lash out\nLike a typical liberal Democrat Steve Schmidt that audio clip and video clip of you're watching it on the stream and Mike online dot com if you if you you know as you hear that and thought\nThat's what a liberal Democrat says that's not what a lifelong Republican operative says Steve Schmidt worked on campaigns\nAnd you go down the list Nicole Wallace\nAna Navarro Tim Miller David from these are all people who have been the voice of the Republican Party all these years and suddenly when a president quite reasonably sense\nWe have to stop illegals and this is a small army seven thousand people a thousand whatever the number is I've seen fourteen thousand and some media reports but the number we keep seeing the seven thousand seven thousand people that's a small army\nYou can pretend that's not a problem\nBut when you've got seven thousand people a sea of humanity marching towards our southern border of course we expect the government to stop that\nAnything else is well\nWhat a Democrat which set on open borders Democrat Steve Schmidt I guess is it open borders Democrat so here's my question view is we welcome you went on a Tuesday where one week away from the most important midterm election of our lifetime and we're breaking it all down for you here in the relief factor dot com studios here's my question for you is last right\nThat these folks are showing their true colors and they have always been\nLiberal Democrats or am I right\nThey're sounding like the liberal liberal Democrats simply because they loan\nPresident Trump's so much and they can't figure out a way to stop him so they figure we're going to put joined the other side if you can't if you can't beat them join them their breeding they're joining the Democrats and sounding like open border Democrats just to stop President Trump's agenda which one is uh do you think\nOur number is eight hundred six five five Mike we have one open phone lines for I'd love to have you joined us to kick it through on our talkline as you can always text

running mate stop and think about that Steve Schmidt the guy who you just heard claims that Trump sounds like a Nazi\nYou know war criminal from the Nineteen thirties\nHe's the one who had the idea\nTo to put to make sure opinion when a\nMcCain's running mate now Sara McCain hardly any ... she's she's hardly a wallflower I can pretty well guaranteed she's completely on board with what the president is doing about birthright citizenship and the migrant caravan and and Steve Schmidt obviously but she's a great idea\nThat these are just sad people they're lost his seat and I don't know

represent the majority of the people in Pittsburgh\nUm fortunately I don't live in Pittsburgh I live on the outs are outskirts in in a in the suburbs but he's an embarrassment and a disgrace to not welcomed the president of the United states at the time that the Jewish people need to mourn\nThe death of there's a lead and people it it's just a disgrace um I I just don't know how he lives with himself and now I'm taking stay in office because he's not representing the people's pets right\nIt's pretty despicable Joe and the you know you know who is welcoming the president the rabbi of the

ball that's how they roll I'm show so appreciative though of the sentiments of the rabbi Jeffrey Myers he said he told CNN yesterday the president of the United states is always welcome I'm a citizen he's my president he is certainly welcome\nNow we're in such crazy a bill that that is almost perceived as a radical reaction\nThe rabbi ... that is grieving with his congregation and dealing with so

are one of these ... that ... many it seems crazed by their hatred of a man who liked it or not is getting a whole lot of stuff done [noise]\nUh it's about getting things done I I'm I like telling you about our our partnership with citizens for truth in drug prices and you're going to be hearing a lot more about this\nThis great effort in the days and weeks to come to an issue you care more about uh about more than any other probably it's hitting the pocket books of American families\nThe outrageous cost of prescription drugs we shoot in the polling we had Frank launched the noted poster poster on the show last week he told us how he got an earful\nWords like Reed and gouging unfair kept popping up lots of questions why does the cost of drugs keep sky rocketing people want to know why I have the cost of the top ten meds increased over a hundred percent since two thousand eleven why does the whole system just feel downright rigged\nWell there's a big answer there's this there's a very simple answer actually the drug makers spend a lot of money lobbying to protect their profits but there's a bigger lobby in America that our politicians have to answer to of course it's we the

ate the dog and people were traumatized I think we found a better video so if you love animals and you want a happy ending\nTo an animal a video I've got one in the wild great white shark meets seal

this about about the Jewish people's reaction to this president one of the great mysteries for me Selma has been to see\nAn American Jews turn on Republicans and Republicans arguably have such a a healthy respect and and a sacred respect for the state of Israel\nAnd yet Democrats are often taking the side of the Palestinians a seemingly understanding this kind of violence and horrible things that Israel has to deal with on a regular basis demonizing vilified Israel so along comes this Republican president who literally\nFulfills his promise of moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\nAnd how could Jewish Americans not embrace this president\nI suspect many do and I have a hunch that since President Trump fulfilled his promise to do just that with the embassy and acknowledge in Jerusalem as the real capital of Israel that\nYou know there are a lot more there's a lot more Jewish support than any other Republican would have gotten orange because believe me Republican and democratic presidents all made the promise to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and none of them came through until this guy\nThanks Selma eight minutes before the hour one

people coming around in your community\nSome of them are there's a lot of ambivalence unfortunately because they focus you know they get they get a lot of their information from the other a mainstream media outlets yeah and it makes it what about so if folks on his style and not a substance\nExactly and that's and that's a downfall rabbi that many people have and that's unfortunate because you know
