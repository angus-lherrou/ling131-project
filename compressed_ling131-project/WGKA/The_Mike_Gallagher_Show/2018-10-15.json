Josh I put her one of my ringer is who's going to play but he has access to a lot of data that other people do because the campaigns talk to them and I want to run down these races for example Josh good morning to you you got to hear from Missouri the Josh Hawley is pulling away and has raised with Claire McCaskill correct\nYeah the polling that Republicans have been doing in the last week has shown Holly building a fairly\nSizable advantage now the race is far from over but the base mobilization that the calving off by really provided has has probably ... more than any other Republican Senate candidate in the country\nI've already believe that id Heitkamp is dying in a Kevin Cramer is going to be the senator there I Am curious as to what you hear out of Arizona ... early voting is a real deal and Arizona people go early and they vote and it's opened up last week\nJust as Christians ... with an avalanche of her left wing legacy am the cabinet effect took over what are you here from ... who who up by the way our drafting up Doug do so you had a double digit wet\nYes so this is going to be one of the closest races in the country a cinema has had\nA pretty small but consistently throughout the campaign but like you alluded to that this awkward dump about send them an anti war at the fact that you know she she said you know it's\nOkay to just made a comment on the radio shows and that will go to the Taliban that's the problem is that these are things that are haunted or on the campaign fits race is still very very close I don't think it's going to be a game

one of those races going to come down to the wire we made it may not even know the results\nYou know I think this is Matt ... of a twenty Eighteen I think he's going to win fairly easily because they don't people don't talk to pollsters in Arizona but let's talk about Tennessee where I think Marsha Blackburn has pulled away I packed I don't think that one's competitive what are you ...\nYeah then that's another race that were being decided late in the Republican's direction and it's you know I wrote about that about a month ago we had\nPolls that show Brett is in a very very very popular former Democratic governor but it's hard when you go to get into a partisan Senate race it's hard to see those numbers are maintained themselves I mean do you work and if you'd rather than for the sixty percent job approval rating ... reading all all all the way through the campaign\nSo his it's become more partisan fight he said he supported by Kavanaugh's nomination under pressure from from the the right but you know because a lot of people on the left it in a sea\nSo it'll be very very tough race for credit to hang onto you bond by but\nWe're only now what what's finished with the I
