the Trump presidency it is a revenge presidency over people who made the legislation that he had to navigate to his benefit\nOr that many people want to call a scam\nNow I haven't seen him do a whole lot about it but he did do some things in the tax plan he did you know why would a real estate developer and a real estate guy\nAnd I'm the same way at the same mentality Trump does I Know that is why would he\nReduced the amount of tax adaptability on certain kinds of real estate as as he did and the Republicans did because they realize\nThat all they're doing is playing into the Democrats narratives with all of this that they're just giving tax breaks to the rich they know they're getting them and they know that that that these tax deductions or ... real value do anything and so they eliminated some of them I think that was a good step in the right direction but it was a minor step\nWe have a real problem in this country where whether you're running a bank\nWith ten when you're a

there was very ... very few lifting that set on the market for three to six months\nAnd the agent failed to sell the home and I've always described that phenomenon and housing in a stage called a monkey could sell real estate in other words\nMy skills of inexperience having sold five thousand plus homes weren't really that in demand here in the last few months or years because you could stick a sign up for the price somewhere in the hemisphere of value\nEspecially if you did it according to a villa which was undervaluing everything um and putting the MLS press enter on the keyboard\nAnd buyers showed up that has ended it's over\nAnd because of that we've had an influx as we always do I've seen three or four cycles of this now in my twenty plus your housing career where agents flood the market all the people\nWho are clerks at seven eleven never studied in school never applied themselves never tried never will try they all get a real estate license and leave their nine dollar an hour job to get rich selling houses and they get in and they sell nine houses and they make more money in a year and they ever thought they could earn in a in a decade in and being a little facetious here\nAlthough I'm not far off and lots of people get harmed lots of people leave equity on the table and lots of people get stuck as they are now with a real estate agent that doesn't know what the hell to do when the market started shifting\nAnd so I'm getting these calls from people in areas that I have not had the privilege of speaking to in the last couple of years because they haven't had

and Johnson from Sudan Johnston find them online Sudan Johnston dot com\nThey are a great real estate closing company a little boutique clothing company I I you know the closing attorneys only let me walk that back\nThe staff at Atlanta base closing attorney operations drive me insane and they drive my clients and saying they my clients don't really realize why they're being driven insane and closing I tried a buffer clients from this as much as I can\nBut these little minions that worked for many of these law firms a little compliance Nazis I like to call them and I know that's a polarizing term but uh get over it and these little compliance Nazis do things like um I we're\nGonna have to have your cell or go online and use their credit card and we want to have them pay a three hundred dollars for the payoff letter for the H LA and we need to get to stand right now three weeks before closing so we have it in time and they need to\nDo it which I very calmly say no not going to happen because the contract does not legally\nNaturally require the cellar to pay for pay off letters in advance um ... you know obviously if you go to the bank and there's a chart for pay off letter their bill it to your mortgage they if there's a charge for the age away pay off later which I think it's a scam that Georgia legislature late the Georgia legislators in that DOMA Denny's out an outlaw\nOr they don't do anything to help consumers in the ... in in in the in the states they just sit around and take their their crony money and do whatever their cronies tell them to do as a puppet tears in puppets\nBut the fact that you have to pay two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars to some third party company when you live in a homeowners' association\nUm ... it's just insane to get a payoff statement that's what you're hiring a management company to do there there it it's all becoming a scam cheat a rate of your finances especially at homeowners association these attorneys\nThey just shut everything off on the seller the seller gets abused now in the real estate transaction and every layer possible unless they're in a house or ten people want it and then you can drive the bus if you've got one buyer right now that wants it and you're negotiating with one buyer\nAnd you're on your way to a closing table at some point with that one buyer everybody's going to take advantage of you as a seller that's what sellers don't get when they try to do for sale by owner that's like open heart surgery by owner it's the same kind of thing you're going to die\nIn some your money's going to die some you're not going to lose all your money but you lose the money that otherwise you shouldn't lose what happens you pay that three hundred dollar letter and the buyer has a a a bad day\nBesides they emotionally can't handle the purchase anymore you just bought a letter for three hundred dollars it's no good you got to buy it again to sell it\nIt's not right the buyer ought to be responsible for that and that's one of the things that were working on and sellers contracts to protect ourselves from these closing attorneys they're so obnoxious their their staff or you know at the pre closer they have the post closer they have the\nThe the closing coordinator and then there's always a fourth person with some odd ball title in there and nobody knows what everybody else has done are doing it's insane\nYou never talked to sing for us not to lose it sort of Johnston I said\nCan you just make it where one paralegal touches the file\nFrom beginning to end and you need to be made available on the phone that you know we just can call you for big level problem oh yeah that's a good idea and so that's what they do it's great it's really smooth it's not frustrating it's not painful\nIt's service like it used to be Stewart and Jonathan if your closing holiday buying or selling with us for somebody else just use them [noise] um there's an amendment coming up in the um\n[noise] of election this November along with Governor and everything else I'm I'm pretty much the undecided three percent in the state on everything I tend to just vote no if it's too complex and pretty much on all these amendments I think that's what I'll be voting I I don't really want to give the government any more power\nWe don't need any more men we need fewer amendments we need fewer laws and regulations we don't need anything else written at the dome of dummies that gives them more power over us but here's one the forest land and timberland conservation amendment amendment number three on your ballot\nHis would revive the current law by sub classifying forest land conservation used property for Advil or um taxation purposes it would have ... a change to the method method of evaluation for this forest land\nAnd it'll survive the provisions I mean they use I mean who the hell even knows what this means I'm In the damn business ... classification for tax purposes of and the prescribe methodology for establishing the value of forest land conservation used property and related assistance grants provide that assistance grants related I mean who the hell rights that stuff\nFive percent of assistance grants maybe the duct tape entertained by the state revenue commissioner to provide for certain administrative costs so in other words they're going to tax land at any level I don't care what level there's a tax on land that's going to be extracted\nAnd then there's going to be a portion of that money used to bloat Georgia government for administrative cost\nYou know how I read this kind of stuff because when they use all of these big words you know the governmental bureaucratic words which is a little minions stupid people like you and they can't understand because we don't need to understand it just do what we tell you everything will be okay that's the government's inability\nWhat they're really saying here is amendment three fourths landing timberland conservation were going to tax land and we're going to blow government payroll and when you create more administrators\nWhich means they're going to be in our way more often now that may be a little oversimplified but with big words that\nPeople are not born in middle Tennessee we don't we don't have much education up there\nAnd a lot of our schools here don't either so I don't really need to figure this out I Need to know because as I read through it and take out all the big words I see more money for government bureaucrats to blow government that is it going to create an amendment for force land and timberland conservation\nLet's stop allowing them to run a business operation on two thousand five thousand thirty thousand acres Georgia Pacific is a huge culprit in this illicit steam\nThe toilet paper empire yeah so let's um let's stop that\nLet's charge them taxes this like we would the guy running a business\nBecause after all they're cutting the timber down in order to sell overpriced toilet paper copy paper and the like it's a business it's a piece of land being used to grow trees to cut them down to send them to factories to make stuff\nAnd we're giving them a tax deduction why because they're not putting houses on the land we'd be better off with houses on some of the land\nBecause then we'd have the additional tax revenue from those properties so my point here is\nWe have a huge problem in the country let alone in the state of cronies taking advantage of tax conservation he's mints they buy a thousand acres or hundred acres or five hundred acres\nThey take the best property the most pristine property\nWith a natural streams and lakes and they polluted with homes side by side where you can hand each other a roll of toilet paper from one window to the next between the home they're so tight and then they give up the worst undeveloped part of the land that no one's ever going to using the cows can't raise honor the roll down the hill so to speak\nAnd they get massive millions of dollars in tax breaks putting that into conservation or timber ease months\nWhere in the county cuts it's tax revenue in half or more\nYou pay for more for the schools you pay for more on your how did you have the burden of the tax bill that they are not paying just disgusts me and it's all in the name of conserving land for future use no it's not\nIt's in the name of finding a way to come up with something that sounds really really hard about who doesn't want to save land for future legacy and use and an enjoyment for our kids and grandkids and our our generations ahead of us I mean that's just if you could say no to that you'd be\nYou'd be just an evil being right so they come up with some you know pretty little idea and then they create a tax avenue\nFor the rich people with powerful lawyers to screw our government and and then the state of Georgia wants to take what we want to take an administrative portion of that so we can administrator at the administrators were mistreating administration\nNo ... no you don't get any more money you don't get the directed more funds in fact\nWe need to undo what we're allowing these forest land in timberland conservation people to do we just don't need to allow it anymore it's taking advantage\nOf the people who are working hard drive and in Atlanta traffic every day for an hour each way to and from work paying their bills trying to live their life the right way raise their kids give them a future provide them a nice clean comfortable safe place to live and they're getting taxed out the ...\n[noise] what\nWas your radio\nWith\nJacob gene and Nick and to New Jersey who a as a CVA designation Rodney that's right and what does that mean\nA certified ... you need your business value to call us up we can do that for you that's true in a salad if you needed for state reasons yeah yeah\nAnd now we have a guest on today or none other than buster breathing muster a is a intern in our research department and yes of course\nToday is an all research show uh we'll get down to a ...\nEnd of the the we're going to delve into the what's going on in the economy what's going on in the financial markets um so why not just go ahead and start off what happened to the\n... the first of all your warm welcome just really gets me in the mood to talk about the economy fan yeah that I can only be a one\nOff but none just stuck around I like you know is\nLike I don't I don't do ... they were brand new or Britain millennials now hello I like ...\nOr some of us are millennials and were brand name to millennials are some of us as in not me\n[laughter] the rest of us know but but there's been a lot going on this week uh if you've looked at the headlines have you looked at the market watch news you'll see\nThe market was down ... gamely on Wednesday it's carried over into Thursday um come back somewhat late in the day no original down you know at the time recording this one and a half ... five hundred um\nFor the week the last five days almost six percent we've lost and the yeah which raises a man of ...\nYou look at the worst performing sector really not a big price has been the high fire all year but taxes down more than eight percent yeah right right\nYeah that's a pretty ugly in a in a lot of that looks has looked overvalued for some time now in as a result of the hardest if you felt like you had been left\nBehind on your utilities ... earlier in the year or this week is your week yeah forty three basic points the only sector that is higher period yeah so ah not too bad you still look at the consumer discretionary is for\nThe twelve month period or up Seventeen point five six percent yes and the five hundred up almost nine percent um information technology Seventeen percent is one year to date though a lot of those gains that we've been seeing a\nHas been a race for Philip three point seven one percent you're today um but we're over what ten percent oh yeah\nYeah we were well over just last week we were still look ... look at the leader there you've got healthcare and three four yeah there I was I was thinking about that just today I saw the headline come across healthcare leaning on the air and if you just fat\nAre are re one I mean uh maybe year year and a half of feel like the the story the narrative around was something's going to be done about these drug prices it really\nWasn't and that was a that was kind of a Trump thing to a lot of folks given credit for a deregulating a financial saying you know you can't really fault that fall from there he did a gave us a new tax reforms but he was talking a lot about bringing the price drugs down\nYeah no that was a big concern for us as obviously holds drug companies surely it's for for further investment I Know personally you guys weren't is concerned is I was but that was a real concern for me are are you going to see those drug makers pulled ... obviously healthcare as a whole done quite well biotech a thing and ... as well as former well\nBeen leading the way it's just interesting to see how things like that play out how what's the\nWinter time you heard when's the last minute I have about drug prices out of layer by writing by right into the panic yeah self designed well if you did that\nIn the past week we did get a numbers on employment situation a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs created in September\nI was shy of what was expected I Believe one eighty four when any filed with the expectation although you have to consider Hurricane Florence a lot of this is seen as kind of a short term hiccup sure so you'd expect in October the number to be better you also had\nA you know and the the good side you had two previous months were asked to revise upwardly yeah and you had unemployment falling three point seven percent yeah who ... who get low right yeah yeah unbelievable but just picked up as well what do we see wage growth to point seven five they\nPerceive us I think it was too yeah ... yeah oh\nYeah we got news this week a on\nA ... a producer price index little inflation news right yeah if you are an CPI both pulled back yeah they're still positive ah PBR two point six percent the corps when you take out food and energy two point five percent or CPI\nA gave us to point ... three\nPursuing three percent a court to point two percent year over year yeah so that's the\nThird month in a row that we've seen a decline in inflation which is good news\nAh yeah\nI mean that's the reason you know ... it will yeah you're bringing your bringing up what's what you heard a lot and I read a lot today is is the fed going to kind of pump the brakes a little bit now since inflation's not as high as we've seen it\nYeah so we have another a decision coming up in December I'm\n... I think if we were in this period in the last cycle so we just got a rate increase or end of last month on the twenty sixth of September uh we got our third for the year\nPoint two five percent increase or an ... at the time they were uh you know if you look at the probabilities according to the options market we were looking at about Seventy seven percent of another increase or just in the last few days I'm ready to move to hire\nA the market really the rates of move pretty uh pretty significantly\nHigher that tend to get up to three and a quarter percent yeah right since come back a bit render team and\nBy my analysis that was really the catalyst for this equity so up there we're seeing I think so too and that you you look at the CPI print that we got\nA Thursday a to point three it seemed to arrest the decline at least in the morning sure maybe thinking that uh I mean it it brought the ten year back back off another five or six bits back down to like three one set of a niche maybe think of the fed my\nMind their home their breaks a little bit here I don't know with inflation you know owners shooting the expectation that two four\nYeah it's still a little above target I think their targets two percent they don't use CPI obviously they use the PC eat if later but a reality is inflation is coming down which is right what the Fed's job is to keep inflation in check at least part of it\nAnd keep employment Hi we got unemployment falls or inflation falls as well\nUm you know ... what's the bad thing here I think you know if you look at it and Nick you talked about being a business value waiter\nUm the uh the analysts would tell you that when the Gulf of capital rises that the value of the businesses ... theoretically lower\nRight so ah shouldn't be a huge surprise to most people that we have a the sell off that we've seen over the last few days right and I think I think we've all admitted to each other or the valuation looks pretty stretched it does I mean it doesn't it it depends on what you look at now\nUh we could have this they'd all day long um peace don't look as bad as it were back in the tech bubble days right around the late nineties\nOr have you how does our recession Rwanda that is from what I've said profit margins are as high ... if not higher than they've ever been right I'm at the same time you have seen more financial engineering this cycle and ... cycles if you look at prices sales or ...\nOr operating her earnings another in other words\nWe're at similar valuations so what we used all over in the tech bubble allergy shows a little concerning and it it it it's why I think\nAs rates move hired is putting pressure on these\nHigh flying names where things are as one of the things that I did want to mention is with the oil base affected those kind of makes sense that the guys you haven't down sure you go back to the middle the middle of last year\nBut with or the middle of this year we had\nOil up Seventy five percent over last year now moving into all the fifty percent overall prices not terribly high relative to previous periods you're right right along the road in the ... and that's what we're looking at CDI anyways is that your ... short of the things that I I Do feel like the fed is watching\nIt and maybe they don't care about CPR as much as we do\nA but not ... number I mean they understand labor markets pretty tight you see it to pollinate where's your number I'm not sure if I personally uh\nIt's going to pump the brakes anytime soon steal the one thing I Will say is when you look at that options implied probability I just talked about Seventy seven percent back right before we had the last interest rate hike\nOh today it's down around Seventy two and a half so it it has the probability hasn't decreased is still about fifty percent were still saying yeah it's very likely will see a fed interest rate hike\nBut we might be getting back to the point where we can be shocked or I had the funding forever\nWe had the fun headlined a today with Trump's the defense vows going crazy you know high you know we're talking about the ...\nOne of the say I want to mention as you know we say this whenever we've had the ten cent decline in the past but you know I think on average market to climb five percent for like four times in a year and and the average years that is that right\nYeah and you have you made the point uh it's about being diversified but it's really more about buying different ethics\nClasses so it might not just be buying a sector or across all sectors you want to have exposure to different geographic locations yeah and you know there's a million ways you can diversify your portfolio but\nUh the point you made diversification only works if there is lack of correlation among the different segments or a rather different pieces of your assets which means that you don't want to buy some and using the same direction\nAnd the way the way we like to talk about diversification if we're not talking sectors is going to be size yard graffiti in style so sure value verse grilled large ... small and international international international versus us so\nBasically ... ... when you set out when you create your plan is that you think about you know the amount of risk that you're willing to take obviously you know your your small cap growth is going to be a lot riskier than your large cat value is your you know Chinese ... more so than us ...\nFor them once you make your plan we say don't try and time the market but re balanced portfolio with the market gives you so if you haven't asked the class is doing well we're a stocking stuffer follows doing well\nGlenn cell that and by some of the losers said it's all your winners and losers get back to your targets\nAnd and not even just within within stocks think outside of stocks they get other asset classes if they fit your investments all your risk tolerance Sean's on a commodity those\nThat are not quite as risky you would rather probably have something that price doesn't move around a bunch bonds or the way to go\nYeah exactly so you know our judgment under the presentation to some students earlier and if you look at it long term\nErnes and you know small cabinet kept large cap equities I think as pilots called twelve eleven and ten percent return is respectively and so you know you make the argument oh well over the long term vote and us put everything in small cast socks will then\nIf you look from ten nine eight seven three and on and on top of the market to the bottom of the market during the great recession\nFinancial crisis there's you have the courage just crushing down fit like arch capital down fifty five fifty eight percent somebody there to\nGet as much as the two and fifty five for the small men and long term treasuries were all there was a strong inverse correlate it it's intuitive I mean ... and everyone's worried everyone's panicking you're going to\nSell your risky assets and buying something you don't worry about some ... you don't worry about so that's going to go up in price\nBy so ah that's a big thing I guess one more point to make is when you think about it from starters from a from a beginning investors point of view\nOr if you are just looking at the allocation peace not trying to get in there and pick stocks you don't have to spend as much time either it and you know it's a very important part of investing and putting together your portfolio\nBut ah the reality is it's a\nA it will take a lesson for your time in a you know most people unless you're just to finance geek like us or you're not gonna you're not going to have that much time to send me and you got a life to live right\nYeah and and the one thing we haven't mentioned that we always stress is at the beginning investor every company ... offers a four O. one K. with a match at least at least put as much as the bachelor 'cause that's free money\nIt truly is yeah you've you've just doubled your money they're matching especially dollar for dollar All right well let's take a real quick break 'em when we come back we will answer some more financial questions we appreciate you listening to stick\nAround [laughter]\nMean they\nShowed\nHim for Norton insurance we recognize the importance of both quality and value when it comes to selecting

R. again so uh uh guys there's there was a good question here and especially on the news of the markets this week David from Woodstock\nA emailed us and said so despite all the economic data there's been coming out of the that's been positive there has been a lot of that um\n[noise] I see a this undertone of negative expectations for nearly every pundit fund manager in t._v. talking head\nI get the feeling that finance industry people are worried about the market turning quickly or should the average investor be expecting a harsh no stuff well I mean to say no after this week would be kind of a short sided but I\nI think what happens is when everything is perfect uh you know it's kind of like there was a commercial on right now a lady sitting on her couch\nShe says it's quiet listen to that\nAnd then she says oh wait a minute it's too quiet\nThat's kind of what the financial world seems to be doing at the moment and uh you know if things do seem really well we've got the as we've already mentioned unemployment very low uh we've got no wages rising faster than inflation people are feeling wealthier so the consumer is doing great\nFeeling great um companies are grown earnings they are we've seen twenty five plus percent earnings growth and last couple of quarters\nTax reform tax reform your taxes been lowered a you know we can go on and on about this business activity indicators that blow out right so more confidence so really from uh the problem with us I think is\nI got a question here and we just as well dive right in dean from wrestled and says I've heard of class shares in class be shares of common stock uh but now I've seen the same for mutual funds or what is this and is this new it is not\nNew a multiple share class has been around for quite some time I believe yeah but more or less or you need to be watching\nFor when you're choosing your shirt classes the fees and and the loads that are associated with each one yeah you can add like it's not like a common stock where you get voting nice not already know so what you want to look at Morningstar\nDot coms of great um assets or to to use to find out what you're paying fees and what's your load might be but it let's say you're looking at ... versus ... shares insurance might have a lower fee or higher iffy with no low T shirt might have a lower fee\nA but no load or I'm Sorry but with all its aren't yet right so you what do you watch those things the expense ratio and is there a load associated\nYeah minimum is there a lot often a lot different quite often writer so uh you know you might have a really low expense ratio for the same portfolio are but in reality you got to invest a million dollars and you know as we were talking mutual funds really aren't for the uh the perfect place for those with a\nA lot of money to go but if it's a smaller amount to get you a portfolio really quickly right absolutely All right so ah you can you can dig around a little bit uh as Nick said on the Internet and get a get a good a fix for what is a different about the different share classes so are\nThere you go dean uh got another question here Steve for inviting says I Want to get your opinions on ... uh no it has a high price to earnings ratio but I feel everything is high right now and maybe not last week or so we got to\nA buying opportunity potentially um maybe we can talk about that in a minute to uh I like their momentum and uh see analysts still consider it a very strong by so um\nYou know Steve we got a I Would agree with you to some degree I'm probably the most attractive thing about the stock is the fact that revenue is growing at thirty nine percent\nThat's pretty awesome I'm getting a expected long term growth a which is three to five years usually is what we figure here a twenty four point four percent growth and earnings as expected a stock like that is probably gonna ... you are a\nPretty big PE ratio in India it's huge point\nSix really high and and a problem I have with it as something that the Jake when I talk about a lot of economic mode right you have ... especially food delivery service so\nThey are wants to keep anybody\nBeing into the space I didn't marry the barriers to ensure a federal law and it's pretty competitive space you've got ...\nYou've got door dash you've got Hoover eats post mates that's\nFour I can name yeah there's probably a started right now yeah a ... and other law there's plenty of\nUh yeah I'm kind of I'm kind of at odds with that take because I Do think if you look back to the sort of platform type\nBusinesses the Amazon and Netflix is of the world I mean they didn't really have a ... when they first started either but they did have a first mover advantage\nAnd I think ... started in Nineteen Ninety nine it does have a ... a bit of a first mover advantage sure and their relationship to the Yelp is definitely worse than the fact they acquired yields\nEight twenty four business which was their delivery business ... there is a revenue sharing going on there um and and he helps found some success you know in in that space so I don't know how you guys feel about you but I I feel like it's kind of go to if I'm looking for a restaurant so they had ... and maybe\nAnd looking for I don't know what I Want to see him for a restaurant a but I don't really feel I drive and you know it's kind of a natural genders but still at the end of the day at\nWhat is eighty five times earnings is kind of price to perfection or they're going to have to execute and what's really difficult market there and it's probably one of the most discretionary\nItems that consumer getting by right you're not order and take out for what lesson like twenty bucks a meal I mean you're spending twenty bucks a meal you're feeling pretty good about your financial condition\nFor sure yeah when you can eat a fast food place for well under ten bucks you learn to ride I don't\nI've got good things to say about it but I I don't think the ... I don't think the price makes sense yeah there was a couple of things that I Would mention and and it's kind of the year point Jacob of it you know there there's going to be some consolidation here the week players are going to get either ... or they're going to get\nGet pushed into bankruptcy or just pushed out of the marketplace girl or a currently own seamless\nAnd not only that a yum brands bought two hundred million stake in the company in February of this year so that to me uh when one of the food uh specially of young British us Taco Bell right and\nAnd uh he is he's a yeah so you know you've got a you've got those three brands that have already got no weighed in saying more or less you know they don't have a stake in anything else\nAny of the other providers plus you said you know Yelp and they've they've a partner with ... so uh if anybody is is the head of the curve I Would say it has to be grown up if you really want to be in the middle of that space\nThat's the one to do I I Would I wouldn't be a struggle for me to hold my nose and go past that ...\nI I I associate it almost with the the onset of these ... meal delivery services like oh the grief pre packaged\nMeals the economic lay over in the economics are so much better for a platform businesslike or whoever and actually has said you know create in a manufacturer of al where it's ... just\nA marketplace and I think the what's the most attractive about the space is if you if you fast forward you know a decade half a decade whenever it happens but you have medical autonomy thing about a margins of something that's entrenched with consumers has\nYou know the tangible asset of a strong brand that basically the way we talk about who were hey I'm just going I'm going I'm going to call it over like no one says I'm going to call on a car yeah is that going to call over you can you can\nStumble into that in ... and maybe it's worth eighty five but like I said the eighty five times already but like I says that's priced kind of assuming that all that happens\nWell you brought over being such a strong brand\nWherever they are funny as well they are breach right there so I'm you know there are others in the market um but it it does look like or others are in the food industry are throwing a little bit of weight behind ... so I'm you know and in my opinion that matters for\nI think uh I think when I was looking at ... as well as far as the actual the actual price point that\nThe delivery costs that uh the the study I had shown like eight major cities it was among the cheapest if not the cheapest across as major cities as far as what the actual delivery fee was well\nShe knows who they earn money off the cell as well as the delivery fee\nOr soon that part of what was so prices ah ah I\nI don't know if it's a rosier license I think it might be a license licensing model and that that basically the companies pay to list on their service if that makes sense that was the ... I don't know I'd have to read more into the\nAll right so in the middle of this question I did throw out something then why don't we talk about it real quick we just have a minute left or is this a buying opportunity you guys uh have an opinion on that or we see if we see a pretty big protracted sell off its not to the level of ten percent as we\nSpeak but ah reality is um you know we uh Nikki throughout the ... the average\nFive per cent decline or two to three years I mean two to three per year we usually have a ten percent decline on average a every year are you guys things that you should wait are what are you saying on that\n... me personally I'm kind of goes back to it talks about the key you know economic indicators that we haven't seen really start to slip yet ... reason at this point I think I Would I Would take it as a buying opportunity I Would do you know all everything all the drive party have at it but\nYeah [noise] what are you there and do you think of the market's up or down this week shaking [noise] beef up the [noise]\nTrade pros ... proud to be a part in what you do and it's our aim to be the easiest one of your along the only job\nWithout one thousand one stop shop kennel locations expert associates had an unmatched election and go to in order to find him repair products you can depend on us to do our part every day and Ferguson's one hour will call the next day delivery\nOrdering an inventory management's illusions are making things simpler for those that worked so hard Ferguson dot com and find a kennel location near you\nFollowing is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nMy story began with that a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nI Want to say a very special happy birthday to my body Ken Ken Kenny as we call him here in Alabama he's on his way to the golf yes [laughter] yeah that's G.

I've had to do it on race cars where we take out the abs unit and you've got to put in your own stuff and luckily they do sell everything for it and it was smart enough to be able to knock it out good job\nYou should have put a proportion of and I forgot to ask them if he did that because see I was a BS with the abs out of the system you had your you're\nLimiting valve you're you're dumb foul ball that stuff that went back into the accumulated so having a proportion about probably wouldn't be a bad idea\nOr not at all and the thing is you know back in those days he he could have put a a regulator for the ... we used to do with the most things\nIn a regular you know it's a proportion of I was just one of the question that exactly\nExactly that way you don't have to run the actual porch involved with the with the four lines in about\n... exactly you know it's funny because a lot of people don't understand this stuff and you know they get to work around the vehicles themselves and I appreciate anyone trying to fix their own truck I think that's a great idea um but\nOr their own car but you got to understand how the systems work\nAnd I see this hot rods a lot when I went to a Maggie valley last year to that big hot rod show up there\nWith a vintage street route as of America I run into a lotta nice people what a lot of great cars and some of these guys going to put these cars together themselves and unfortunately they do some things wrong wiring is usually the big thing you know it's certainly for but [noise] I met this older gentleman whose wife\nWhen I say older they were late seventies maybe even early eighties wonderful couple that were from um Arkansas and they had a little high boy thirty to forty three window coup pretty little car open ended car you know no ... no founders quaint little card small blocking it\nPretty paint so I'm looking at the masters from which is hanging on the fire wall\nUm which I Would have put it under the floorboards keeps a firewall cleaner but that's where it was and I'm looking at the brake lines it's a double masters similar ... valve an adjustable proportion of al and it was in the front brake circuit [laughter]\n[laughter] but they didn't they didn't know you know yeah\nUh I said you know\nI think I take that to somebody understood breaks and have and replenish breaks system and I tried to explain to them what are we doing as you get on the brakes hard and it limits the front breaks from coming on and you've got drums in addition to find you're going to feel a drag but you're not going to stop short you know\nMhm the drums locked up your coming around\nYeah exactly so automatic Kennedy's listening kitty is listening has been going down to cope show is that the big or believe in Gulf shores was spared from this hurricane Michael\nAnd you know there was there was a lot of plans um for people doing different things you know a couple wiped out with the damage in\nMexico beach in Panama City in Panama City beach which are two different places by the way um you know Appalachian coal Ohio she all that plays Mexico beach was that's where my son got married Mexico that decimated poor people man yeah yes\nWhat's really interesting in in Talladega this weekend is a NASCAR race and you know a lot of folks come up out of that area and I've watched an interview last night on TV with a gentleman he and his wife\nBut I'm fairly late model Chevrolet dueling for the nice traveled trailed behind they left on Monday to come up here to Talladega camp for a few days and see the sights in Birmingham in Talladega and then go to the race\nAnd they're sitting here watching this on the tablets are on TV um they were from the are destined area watching the house gets destroyed that stinks\nIn horrible\nAnd [noise] well it's just natural disaster and uh you know and then that rain where all the way up through the Carolinas where those poor people have already been hit by Hurricane Florence and they got more rain and flooding I couldn't buy a break I Know but you know just move on and see what happens you know\nYeah so we're going to move on and go to mount Holly and talk to pat about his tailgate not opening on his not near good morning\nIranian surprised how are you\nOh not bad how about yourself well or not somebody know morally bargain it's not a surprise to me I have an excursion\nOh okay well you got headaches in years well it was a surprise to me that we're getting into trouble of\nCourse when you let it when you borrow it out lend it out of course when it has the problem of\nAll it all ... and that's what I thought a bullet which isn't the handle the grand anything than we do a job on the on the yep\n[noise] so what's what needs to happen 'cause this plastic and it's got it's a plastic of actual later and it's got the bars that go into the handle just like your door handle and when you activated it moves the bars in or out and releases the hatch because your glass opens up separate from the hatch right\nYeah okay so what you need to do is because you have no function or anything he has to somehow get that back panel off\nAnd push away from the door she can go down there look at the rocks locate the Raj open the door didn't continue servicing with the door open and the plastic out of your way but the tricky part is to get the plastic off the door without breaking the plastic so you can open the door\nAnd then you can start to service and fix the ... door\nWell I I look at it like I won't call it's not really a hatch way but there's there's two places on the top one on the side where there's like an old or shape\nLaw will shake a plastic like I Can't really pushed on me\nAnd I want to get up to take out all of a place where I didn't necessarily do\n[noise] um I don't know venue where would they leave you a room like for instance a Corvette has electronic electronic doors and it's got grad handles in case you lose all power you can still open everything would grab handles but I haven't seen anything like that on a hatch what do you think Sam [noise]\nHe's\nComing real tough to get that dog pound loss we closed you know\nYeah I have to do with my excursion you're going to break maybe one tab or something but\nI have to do my same thing my excursions as actually broke it's plastic the rock came out of the plastic handle that whole pieces five hundred dollars the handle is incorporated into the uh Trent peace so I had to pull the panel off open the hatched they continue ... a service and fixing it I was able to fix it without having to purchase and in one\nOf those I've got to get like a adult panel to take a whole sheet awful back\nYou could take the apply bar and put a ... a towels around as she don't scratch me thinking about have to buy new new tools you know what I mean\nYeah it is you know when they stole the show and getting us all of us\nGoing to be it anytime just like when the doors stuck score is stuck close when the doors stuck close you have to figure out a way to get the door panel off to get inside the door to fix and open and you know the door panel only comes off when the doors open so this is going to be higher\nThat's how I thought well that sounds like a dog will be a hint without I was hoping you had a magic trick yourself\nNo and the thing is the magic trick is to not slammed the rear hatch yeah that's what brings doors\nThat made me a lot of the in the LA meaning of what we call this call with them and the you know they're waiting for my grandchildren bottle will take part in it so and the whole cookie anyway so it doesn't matter so but anyway I guess I'm going to have to fix that [laughter]\n[noise] well here in Alabama what we would do it take a plasma cutter [laughter] and go to the outside Victor nice little flap the two fold down the actor waiter that open the door you can send you replace all you're actually the parts and then it ... back and then you put a sticker over it never does duct tape duct tape is chrome\nAnd so you don't want to get all that and then yeah you know make sure to the top of the the recovery tankers full you know sort of total line not fall to the top it's got a line that says maximum and\nThen I kept but up in a way you know you'll be All right\nAnd you have to make sure that turn on your feet or so that it feels have ya ... eater core and then also don't ever forget everybody when you're doing a thermostat this spring goes towards the engine\nThe ... goes towards the engine a lot of people have made that mistake a lot of cars don't allow for that mistake but some do allow you to put that in backwards [noise] [noise]\nOkay in any\nOther tips that you can just as far as the uh\nHow many miles down
