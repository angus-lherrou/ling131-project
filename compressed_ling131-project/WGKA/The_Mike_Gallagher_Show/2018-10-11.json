Democrats are absolutely fine with the regime [noise]\nA mob mentality I don't know that you can find more establishment Democrats and Eric Holder Eric Holder is often mentioned as a presidential candidate Eric Holder the former attorney general under Brock Obama\nSaid something this week that I don't hear many Democrats condemn\nUm in fact we were used in the show up and you might have heard a bit of it a moment ago I'm not certain that there is a Democrat\nAlive who has a problem with what he said and therein therein lies the reveal\nI Need to I Need to spend a minute and reveal and and and let's let's just bask in the transparency of the bad shape the Democrats are facing that they're in right now\nI mean Democrats still remains a favorite to win back the house\nUm they always had a long shot bit of taking the Senate that was what they had hoped but now that appears to be demean even further polls are suggesting that Republican voters are\nRe engaged over the Brett Kavanaugh battle maybe even by the way Democrats are behaving these days and manner they behaving badly\nAnd for some reason those same pollsters though should jest but it's not going to be so good for Republicans\nOn the house side this somehow Democrats are going to take control of the house which would be very bad [laughter] make no mistake about it that'd be a problem that would be\nUm I I catastrophic is an exaggeration but it would be really really bad for the Democrats to take control of the house [noise] but for the first time in a few weeks a new poll is showing Martha Nick Sally\nSpringing out to a a big lead over a cure stern should among uh in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp is done I mean her prophetic explanation of why she voted no\nOn Brett Kavanaugh how she was ready to vote yes until she turned the audio off and saw just video so his body language led to hurt no vote that takes put pitiful of pathetic to a whole new level\nUm and that's I saw somebody on town hall or somebody say that's a clown senator that's just not that is able to that isn't even a serious person in in public life who would even attempt such a bogus explanation I tend to agree\nSo we're going to kind of focus a little bit on some of these key congressional races and see who's vulnerable who's not\nBut I go back to the fact that I'm waiting for one Democrat\nTo condemn the rhetoric and the violence that we're seeing and it is violent when you're when you're ... when you scream at somebody in a restaurant and hound them\nAnd change them out of a public place like a restaurant or a subway those are acts of violence Don Lemon that that speaking of clowns the CNN clown gesture Don Lemon can try to pretend that is a\nMob violence it is when you have a group of scary people going into a husband and wife like ten and highly cruise in a restaurant and shrieking and cursing and hounding them out of a restaurant that's an act of violence yet nobody may have been hit but ... is it a lot of forms\nAnd Democrats or embrace you this you don't believe me let's listen together to Eric Holder you could watch the slip if you're a streaming the show today Mike online dot com if you're near a computer this powerful stuff because he uh was in Georgia campaigning\nFor a Democrat there and somebody had a camera in the front row thankfully and they ruled what Eric Holder talked about Michelle Obama's famous quote when they go low we go high Eric Holder rejects that clearly this is number one\nAudio curve audio and video courtesy of Fox News and gravy and listen to the way of various that was Democrat\nDescribes our discourse in October of twenty Eighteen just a few weeks away from the mid term elections\nIt's time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are to be as dedicated as they are to be committed to sail shallow he says I Love my wife like really tight with lawyers get ...\nReally says that you know when they go low we don't [laughter]\nThey go low we [noise]\n\nThere you go and the audience was even a green ... with the Michelle Obama portion oh yeah that's what you hear a woman said that's it when when they go low we go high will they abandon that\nThey've abandoned that entire premise of being civil Hillary Clinton you heard her yesterday you can't be civil with Republicans will only be civil with Republicans you said if we win if Democrats win\n\nOf course this was on the president's radar last night he was an eerie Pennsylvania big rally packed house\nOf course there were some criticism of the president's going to a rally during a hurricane or I mean I get the criticism but you got twelve thousand people many of whom spent two days camping out to see him and to participate in the rally and there's nothing that's not going to get done because he's on a ... at a rally for a few hours in Erie, Pennsylvania and\nThe president ripped into the former A.

what's at stake what we're up against because quite bluntly I'm I'm tired of hearing well the Republicans are going to hold the Senate but they're going to lose the house is that a foregone conclusion\nAt this point in time we are seeing a very volatile environment so from the outset of the twenty Eighteen cycle we knew was going to be very competitive Democrats are very energized or they want all out of ... that is that is their\nTheir their overall agenda right now what we're seeing with twenty seven days to go is a resurgence of Republican enthusiasm post\nA Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings [laughter] that is due in large part to Republicans coming back home\nOnes who who might have been a little uh disinterested in in the mid term election but are seeing what the Democrats have plant we're already seeing Nancy Pelosi\nAnd other House Democrats are lined up a litany of potential investigations they plan to undertake if they get control the house and we see on a regular basis their candidates talking about issues like\nAbolishing ice undoing the ... tax plan and protecting sanctuary cities if they're able to regain control the house that is what's at stake\nIn this election and I it has a way of turning off independent voters in motivating a Republican base matters\nYou know I I heard something less than a TV made my blood runs cold Kevin McCarthy pointed out Maxine Waters\nWill become the chair of the house financial services committee if the Democrats take control the house like gosh I I I I think that just motivated about three million people to call crawl across broken glass to vote for Republicans in November to have that ... in a chairmanship position anywhere I mean\nWe're seeing the difference the stark difference Jesse between the angry mob that as being raised by the Democrats you heard the comments Eric Holder Hillary Clinton were not going to be civil and less until we when my gosh the the protesters and they are all Democrats Jesse these aren't Republican protesters\nOne hundred percent we don't Maxine Waters is someone who who kicked off this a reprehensible behavior up saying that they should go in a cost of the White House officials are cabinet members are Republican elected officials in their in their whole you know near their homes in restaurants at\nGas stations wherever they are is that is the type of rhetoric that's being used by the Democratic party day and that will become a kind\nOf common practice\nIf Democrats get control how that's why it's so important for Republicans to get out there and vote to match that democratic enthusiasm because this this is what they what we saw the ... you know you had the\nPotential twenty twenty presidential candidates up on stage you know during the judiciary hearings for Brett Kavanaugh you saw the way that they behaved that is going to take on a more of an emphasis as we move past\nThe mid term elections in it to the presidential years of that you know if you combine that with a a a a house led by Nancy Pelosi in a democratic presidential primary going on you're going to see some really a a porn behavior from the Democratic party if they're able to regain control\nJesse ... national Republican congressional committee we appreciate you joining us other Mike Gallagher show very very much here it is here's the video this was taken by
