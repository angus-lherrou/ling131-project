sham Hugh you wrote about it earlier this week this is a\nVersion back to McCarthyism by the Democrats I mean it is outrageous that character assassination the Democrats are burning a very bedrock of our democracy and that is the presumption of innocence and this and this character assassination is the the new low in my time here in Washington just unbelievable you\nKnow your colleagues center and told me earlier today that absence corroborating evidence of Dr Ford's testimony specifically she will be I guess about do you believe that the one Republicans will have the same standard apps and corroborating evidence of Dr forged testimony\nI Do you I Believe that uh we've done everything we can from a Chuck Grassley the chairman of the judiciary all the way down to this latest FBI investigation we done everything they've asked for\nThere's absolutely no corroborating out as a matter of fact the Democrats say well this is just a he said she said and we have to decide who's telling the truth no it's more than that because she brought cooperating witnesses three who could not corroborate her story\nBut they did actually corroborate his story so I Believe that we will get fifty one votes later this week\nNow there are also troubles with her testimony and the president brought them up last night and he's been criticized but I got to tell you in the first Arab today show and I do this for the benefit of the audience are just tuning in\n... in an invalid Sarah in Tampa and in Detroit Norma in Michigan Alexandra in Newport Beach Elaine in Louisville Jeannie in Oregon Shelly in Columbus and in San Diego all first time caller to the show all women can out of ten one cabinet confirmed nine out of ten applaud what the president did last night\nAnd yet the blue bubble media is attacking him for doing it what do you think senator ... do\nYou know here I travel my state a lot last couple of weeks and I hear from women all over they know that the fed rock founding principles of our founding mothers and fathers uh sacrosanct and this presumption of innocence cannot be waved around all the way the Democrats are doing it right now this is an absolute travesty for the American justice system\nOr I Can't wait to get him confirmed that the Democrats are the ones that are conducting a wall women by the way he knew the person that's been abused in this whole process is Dr for the Democrats promised to not reveal this this could have done been done confidentially which is what she wanted instead someone up you're either in the Congress ones will Congress woman's\nOffice or in senator Feinstein's office somebody leak that letter\nAnd now after that game public is just outrageous and by the way that set three weeks after dying Feinstein head this letter she had her personal interview with judge Kavanaugh she didn't mention it at all there was a one word of conversation about the letter when she met with him probably the first time\nThe house has been abused and I believe I've been thinking about this a lot because I'd never seen this kind of reaction either no radio since Nineteen Ninety [noise]\nIs that a ten year old daughter and a fourteen year old daughter are going to be hearing about this from friends and photos and cheap shots for the rest of their lives they're going to hear their father accused of being a gang rape is they're going to hear their father accused of being a drug\nAnd it's all without any kind of precedent and I think Americans are revolted by that center Purdue\nHere this is what's going on let me let me give you some close to the Democrats my wife was physically accosted this week at the airport here in Washington I was physically accosted by members of the center of public democracy now these people are funded by the open society foundation that's George Soros\nHe has put thirty to listen to this thirty two billion that's with a B you in that organization of the last few years this is open warfare here's what senator Booker said\nGet up in their face and some congresspeople Maxine Waters said they're not going to be able to go to the restaurant they're not going to be able to go to the gas station they're not going to be able to shop and a department store get up in their face absolutely harass them\nI mean this is not the America that I came to serve this is not the American that women back home on this is not the America that we fought and died for over the last two hundred years I'm telling you Maxine Waters Cory Booker\nNancy Pelosi shame on them Hugh Nancy poses I don't know why we aren't all up wrought while there aren't uprisings all over the\nCountry what Jerry Adler has threatened impeachment proceeding I Hope no one is taking that seriously because he did not live this whole controversy about drinking it's all manufactured the devil's triangle it's all manufactured he did not lie and Jerry Adler threatening perjury proceeding is a joke does anyone take that seriously\nNo not up here not that people know the facts I mean we've looked at the testimony we've heard all the witnesses I mean this is an absolute zero case there's not a district attorney in the world are in the country that would have taken this to a judge for prosecution\nI honestly I I think that you know when I'm when Chris Coons says a judge Kavanaugh's who speak in a lifetime appoint a Supreme Court and I'm reading this\nAnd who are now think bears the burden of disapproving these allegations that the U.S senator you I'm calling these guys out because this is the bedrock of what we fought for all these years I mean the presumption of innocence as what McCarthyism challenge and you call that our this is the closest thing to McCarthyism I've seen in the last fifty\nYears last question do you think it'll be confirmed by Saturday\nI Do I think we should see or the FBI report you know even the Democrat said he shouldn't take three or four days so we should see that as early as tomorrow and get the procedural vote on the way and before we leave this week we were told yesterday we will get a vote on him and I believe we'll get him confirmed\nBreaking news at breakneck pace this film might

mother had some tax scheme he's not as rich as he says he is a ha we got 'em again\nMeanwhile the FBI capital investigation might wrap up today which will of course be another reason for the Democrats\nWho oppose Brett Kavanaugh to say well this wasn't sufficient they didn't even take a week they didn't even interview Christine Blasey Ford we're already hearing that we know what they're going to do because they are\nPredictable if nothing else\n[laughter] they're very very predictable there's a headline above the fold in today's USA Today that tells you everything you need to know about what's going on with Brett Kavanaugh and the way the direction we're in the country and I loved it I Love how useful to ships\nHere's the headline and USA Today confirmation long and the Kavanaugh fight the article says the battle over Kavanaugh's nomination to the court is unlikely to end with this confirmation vote Democrat said they won't let go of the sexual assault allegations\nEven if he's elevated to the high court if they win control of one or both houses of Congress in November they'll be in a position\nTo continue the fight it's almost like USA Today is unintentionally confirming you better get out and vote [laughter] those it's almost like they're saying do you see Republicans will happen if you stay home\nOn November the ... they're gonna they're not only are there are also good to do everything they can to roll\nEvery single Trump policy achievement of the last nearly two years we know that it is up to us all of this is up to wash November ... put it on your calendar\nI don't care if you're if you're in the hospital having wheel of a hospital bed into the ... the polling place drags your bought into the polls and vote on November ... for Republicans because the USA Today article is a is a very very\nPowerful reminder of what is at stake and what is at stake it's look the Democrats control the candy store we've got to keep the house we got to keep the Senate and this nation will breeze a huge sigh of relief it's up to you\nNow let's let's take care of this\nBecause this is going to be tough because you're probably not going to like entirely what I have to say and that's all right hey you know I'm a big guy I can get somewhat VIX gives the president as you've heard by now had a rally last night when he was all where he was again on fire\nHaving a great time or a pact tall and Mississippi after about a week and a half of being tremendously subdued about Christine blobs before\nBeing very careful about Dr Ford and not criticizing her are attacking her mocking her was there was one tweet and that kind of over pretty quickly\nAnd other than that it's been pretty quiet about it you just kind of let this process play out he said the other day in the oval office shuts down and credible and she seems like a fine woman that's what he said a few days ago\nWell here it is ... this is what you said last night in Mississippi which has the media um you know\nTheir heads explode once more as it often happens when the president says something very\nProvocative\nI ... I had one\nWell is it goes you know it was wasn't there I'm good how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't\nKnow [noise] [noise] [noise] what\n[noise] I'm downstairs where was I don't know but I had one that's the only thing are in [noise]\n\nIn a man's life is in tatters a man slices shattered\nAbout uh the first to me and we need to take away is that Donald Trump being Donald Trump or he he goes to the drug dealer he responds viscerally he is he fights\nHe battles\nAnd that's just hip and and he that's what got him in the White House and he's going to keep doing it\nUm until he leaves the White House hopefully in six years\nMy problem is that\nThe base really doesn't have anything to do it this week my my concern is\nHis his his supporters in a rally at a rally in Mississippi really have nothing to do with played out how this goes it is down to the to to a handful of senators your your your plane\nTo a handful of people maybe senators you can count on one hand\nAnd my fear\nIs that if one vote is loss because a senator believes that\nThe accuser has been unfairly mock or taunted or attacked\nThan it wasn't worth\nI don't know what the I don't know what the upside is so I'm not going to come to work and why do you and pretend that I'm Glad\nThat he said something that I Wish you hadn't said I'm not I wish you hadn't said I've also always always worried about an uncorroborated accusation\nUm not necessarily be non truth I don't know what happened thirty six years ago we never will we don't know if Brett Kavanaugh did it or not I happen to believe based on his life and his career and his record and his incredibly qualified\nResume he should be the next Supreme Court\nJustice\nI don't believe that she has enough corroborate shouldn't to seal the deal in making the case that he's unfit I Know what the the ... the filthy game the Democrats are playing in moving the goalpost goalpost I understand completely\n\nHow vicious they've been and I do share his concerns all along with the current concerns of millions and millions of people\nAbout the smear campaign and how it can ruin somebody without any any substantiate substantiate ... it's a problem it's a big problem and finally after a year of the the meat to era\n... we're having a a national conversation about what happens when somebody has falsely accused I have a story in front of me there were some dentists accused of rape and sexual assault in Las Vegas and it turns out that you cues are\nMade it up now is your story is you don't hear often but they happen for a dentist from California including three brothers who faced rape charges for the alleged assault of a woman at the when Las Vegas had all the charges dismissed in court this week prosecutors dropped all the charges\nAre one of the lawyers said after river review the facts it was clear that the allegations were completely fabricated to Fort dentists for professionals from California three of the brothers but based ruin Asian for what apparently was a completely fabricated\nClaim this happened and when President Trump said this week I worry about today's boys I worry about being people being falsely accused I worry about like you said I've been falsely accused\nIt can happen and I\nAbsolutely get it and I share those concerns in this case the case in this week and in this time we got to focus on these senators and get judge Kavanaugh cross the finish line and again for for for where I sit there wasn't anything gained\nI and I have even mild criticism I just don't want any I'm ... I'm just worried about these these these votes this week Keith that's all I'm focused like a laser job one get Kavanaugh confirmed job to get everybody to vote on November ... on November ...\n[noise] yeah it's imperative that the that the all the Republican a jump on him and then when they need the mansion and the other ones have got to even though Senator Graham said they would never lose it real quick question the point I saw Senator Graham and the airport yesterday and she has to be I I should have asked them I just want in Denver thumbs up but\nThey'll rip quick so it's it's as Senator Feinstein and she is she was so concerned about the confidentiality doctor for it and why why is that if I asked this question and what was she had done if it was never leap\nBingo let's answer that coming up we're glad you joined us thanks for your kind words you know that might gather show\n[noise]\n\nYou know um we all know that the elections are about one thing you have to show up this election is probably the most important election we have experienced\nIn many many decades many call it the most important election of our lifetime I don't really disagree your tax savings or on the ballot the American economy is on the economy is on the ballot America's incredible comeback is on the ballot jobs you're on the ballot you know what the Democrats want to take away\nWhat's the biggest issue on the ballot politicians have bureaucrats in Washington or they're the ones who want to be in charge or you and me you want to preserve the victories\nOf the past two years this is about being engaged getting active taking taking neighbor to the polls\nMake calls send emails and go to tax cuts work\nDot com tax cuts work dot com they these are our partners uh job creators networks they make it easy for you to do your part of the tax cuts work dot com do just sit on the sidelines if you're ready to have you got that fighting spirit like President Trump does go to tax cuts work dot com\nToday my leg or you wouldn't put a square peg in a round hole so why would you deploy a traditional firewall on a modern decentralized network\nFire walls have new requirements for businesses leveraging fast pace applications and public crop platforms like a double us Asher and Google Cloud we're in the cloud generation now so you're fire walls have to be engineered to fit right in\nMarine claim your clock network trying barracuda cloud generation network our application firewall free\nAt barracuda dot com slash fire walls [noise]\nI'm a ... phone so I have one job I grew staff downtime for banks are often ... who can give you twenty four seven for thousands of life is too damn guy always been around for over Seventy five in the Ninety seven percent comes\nTo my body function eighty five just got mediocre and he's a scale guy go off and award winning\n\nGeico expect great savings in a whole lot more\n[noise] with us on the News I'm rich Thomas and even Washington\nThey could be your son thank you have your husband President Trump's bleed to American mothers amid the unsubstantiated sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh that President Bush and concern over the impact that the Kavanaugh allegations on young men urging mother is not to vote for politicians who actively support\nAnd encourage such accusations\nThe death toll from the earthquake and resulting sue nominee in Indonesia now risen to just over fourteen hundred\nUnited Nation's highest court ordering the U.

from the today show from this morning she says the senator Christians were you ever going to vote for me anyway\nWell that's true I was not going to vote for him and that's based after interviews and I mean she's calling them out and she said ... what you got you guys are going through your books and notes from thirty six years ago the American people a lot of people are saying what what's up with that\nAnd I was I gave her a lot of credit for calling the Democrats out that's the part that's the that's the big lie of the Democrats let's have one more week and then we can decide whether judge Kavanaugh should be\nA Supreme Court justice or not but only the ones calling for that the Democrats that are so excited about another week\nNot voting for him and they said from day one they weren't going to vote for him again\nWith a capital out so\nYou know that's that's that's um that's all is struck did was we get closer to November sex what are we thirty one days away thirty two days away we're almost there the term election is going to be here before we know\nAnd how the capital thing plays out is going to have a big big role in all of that here is Janet hey Jared welcome you're on the ... show how are you\nI Am fine sir and I usually enjoy what you have to say but today I Am quite irritated\n... oh don't ask don't ... what are you are today I Am okay I thought\nI don't know what a ... for a president and I can imagine there were hundreds and hundreds of people this little ... say something about cabinet scale and he did and I appreciate that he did I Would have been waiting for that too but I think you know gay fuel\nEver said a single thing in two years but you do you wish you hadn't said\nOh for heaven's sake yes All right at the point of influencing hundreds of people that think that he was wrong was saying\nWell I'm not I'm not worried about hundreds of people Janet I'm worried about a handful of senators this is going to get down to the wire you know that right at\nBest and then you add that well you know first of all I\nMean with all due respect I appreciate you elevating me do such a a a national prominence that I'm as important as the president I'm not many are saying he gave them fuel that's the whole point he\nGave up what you're saying you know\nThat's well I think there is merit to that believe me when he says in a rally that is now carry round the clock by this despicable news media that gives perhaps a senator or to fuel to say I'm not going to vote for cabinet Janet all I care about is getting Kavanaugh confirmed you do to right\nOh absolutely but that's the ... she went to the people that we're talking\nAbout you know not given I Can't give fuel to that on my words on a radio show can't possibly be any more impactful than the president the most famous man in the world he in his words you're what's going to stand and let me\nGet what he says okay for him to take that\nThey are just so let me ask you this into in a week from now we hear if Kavanaugh loses by a boat and we find out the two or three of the senators said we're all set to vote until the president said what he said in Mississippi who liked\nGallagher gave us the okay\nThere it might ... head Janet I Love you I'm not that you think the senators are listening right now to my show and they're going to change their vote because of meat or because of possibly what the president said come on\nI don't think they're going to change their vote I Want the president said I think everybody expected\nRight well so let me ask you a second time if two senators said we were all set to vote until the president said what he said in Mississippi then will you you'll have been right no absolutely\nNot all that then I and then I Will hear well then I Will have been right but I've only been like that it was probably better when you twist things around I don't\nChat and why you don't get your angry you know what happens sometimes is that\nAn irritated that you stand to say that the president said something wrong because he talked about the cabinet ... on these shows all the\nShow I wanted to talk about the cabinet case all day long he's been doing it all week for the most part every day\nHe has been perfect on the cabinet case and I and I defend him worrying about men falsely accused I there's a way to do this without mocking it as the way the stupid media has put it the accuser\nI mean there's there's all this was a time for a little diplomacy you know that's all by Janet I'll say this\nAnd and and give you credit he knows what he's doing he he always knows what he's doing\nSo and he's been brilliant at it and you've heard me day after day say the guy is ... he has outsmarting everybody outsmart the machine the media that Democrats

working at his job yeah the poll we took over the weekend Mike was great we ask that members if they should have delayed for one week and we were shocked\nEighty five percent of our members of that's thirty three thousand people to the ball while eighty five percent said no they shouldn't have delayed the way they should have voted right away\nAnd I was shocked I mean in my opinion he's the best candidate we've had for Supreme Court in my lifetime based on his record based on fact he knows the government based on his\nJudicial history this guy is a class by himself\nThe reason that the Democrats terrible were flailing Dan is because they know how qualified he is it simply about judicial philosophy\nI watch Chris Coons this morning the Democrat who's now joined at the hip with Jeff Flake and there's something going on the road and they've taken this show on the road now they're going everywhere and and appearing together\n... admitted I don't like I don't want a conservative on the bench with you about Dan\nIt's a shame Ginsburg got Ninety some odd vote for Republicans and Democrats and she was ultra liberal so it's again they're not playing fair when we elect the president\nThan we expect him to be able to appoint his judges when they expect when they elect the president like they did with Obama he appointed his judges and we didn't like with that as long as they qualified and this guy is eminently qualified\nRight either you know even Senator Lindsey Graham\nWhen he had his fiery speech which I think most of us\nShe stood up and cheered for the other day yeah yeah but he even said hey when you see showed him my or or cake and you tell them I said Hi cause I voted for them and it was a powerful reminder that these guys Democrats don't play ball the way we do they don't they're not doing anything in good faith that this is not a good yeah\nWell I agree with you and they should be ashamed of themselves but you know what the American people are pretty

and that's a you know to to to get an eighty five percent I mean does it do you do you guys do this pretty regularly on on the news\nEvery week we do a poll and this one is the the probably the highest the vote in awe of all the numbers who voted for a particular cause since they we voted on Obamacare when I was for his best gotcha then there was\nFifty thousand people said it was horrible wild man but now now this is also very important to be ... elected Trump said he could appoint judges and these appointing judges and our members are happy with\nThat is why this is so important that

to disconnected culture is a man of faith or\nVery excited about this new job like our show how are you my friend\nLike I'm doing just fine thanks\nGood good I Want to let's dive into the reason he wrote the book obviously social media is such an important part of so many people's lives and yet there is there real perils to being kind of trapped in their social media bubble in fact\nYeah boy either um you know we live and hyper connected world and we seem to be less connected to each other and that never before and so that's the kind of thing I always want to address as to what it is\nThat makes us the kind of people we become right where you know we find 'em just is lack of civility and I've been concerned about this for years about that the climate are personal and corporate civility\nYou know and this this connectedness between families and friends so writing the book was my attempt to address those issues and maybe offer some some really good thoughts and how we might get past that and analyze why we've got ... far and things like that so who it was fun to do\nWell I think the reason I was drawn to your message and why I like the book so much the biggest takeaway for me\nIs is abandoning the anonymity of the Internet and and and connecting with people face to face I mean it's been tough for me over the decades that I've done this for a living at least even with a caller that I talked to on this show where there's a name and there's a person and there's a voice\nIt's not really an anonymous and yet social media has elevated anonymity to new heights and I fear\nIn bold ... really really awful awful online behavior Joe\nOh I don't think there's any doubt that I think we all see that and that's the problem with that entity that fosters cowardice I think at times and I think it enables us to have I'm blessed and best of our\nNature come out where we can say what we want to say um any kind of vitriol that we want to throw out there and have no accountability so part of the problem is accountability right\nUh when I face to face with you by less likely to be that kind of course and then if I were disconnected hiding behind us fire wall of him personality as I call it so accountability is an important thing\nUm and I think the problem with the enemy and many of the Internet is that we only become truly him and\nWhen we intersect with each other when I see in your eyes your soul when I hear your heartbeat when I hear that pop up belly up your dream I then become more connected with you and I am less likely to be\nI'm against you when I find out that we are really more alike than we seem to be and so those are the kinds of things I think anonymity parades on the Internet and leave the elevator that to an art form this ugliness\nAnd uh the problem is that many of our young people have a bigger relationship with their cell phones and with a friend\nAnd that just continues to compound the problem because we're leaning ladder against or wrong law to get to trick community and that's what I Try to deal with in a book\nJob attack Israel 'cause she wrote an friended finding proof community and a disconnected culture of course you can get it at Amazon and we have a link posted it might go online dot com or\nTo make it easy for you to order this very very important book Joe what do you believe the takeaways are um in in this new world we're in and this this disconnected culture what should people be doing much debt should we take to try to to try to break this pattern\n[noise] I think first of all and what I tried it mentioned in the book is um [noise] what would you take a step back you know when I'm treasury agents are taught to uh you know what a counterfeit is sure\nThey do look for counterfeit they just get to know what the real thing looks like so well that the counterfeit it's so obvious [laughter] I think because many people live in a counterfeit culture\nThey haven't seen the real thing so our job is to help the looming\nThe real thing to them that will find\nA in their hearts something that says boy that so much better than what I'm doing now and so part of the issue is trying to help people understand what is the genius of what true community is about and the genius of our country which has found it on the knowledge that\nWe find that our motto which as one from many a car but soon them right written on all of our bills in coins and the reality of that is when we understand that\nThe diversity that God has planned in the world all that's much better than just saying that scene uniformity and so understanding that we are stronger when we respect our differences we are stronger when we engage with each other to find out what we're really like\nAnd so that it's important that we have that can go back to engaging with each other or it could have animals will sense what we're ... and so that's important and then not understanding that we're only strong when we stand together regardless of whether we believe in what we are\nEach other's opinions and and I'm a ideas and things because it's important that we hear each other and so I like and that to um the redwood
