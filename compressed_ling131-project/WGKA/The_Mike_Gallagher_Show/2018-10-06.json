{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "So now let's get to the what do we do part um how do you help your clients and how can you help our listeners out there prepare for a beer market\n[noise] well you know I start with the fact that you must have a plan or strategy we call it a roadmap are actual recall her retirement road map and so it was technically you should start planning that road map ten years before retirement\nThat most folks to come see us or a year away or two years away or maybe they've already retired and we can make it work\nBut you're better off if you're you know two three four years away five years away even as longest ten years away and what we do we sit down and we believe it or not we listen to people or we sit and listen to you know what they want retirement to look like\nOr were they going to be living what they're going to be doing what's their hobbies in retirement are going to work part time and they're gonna start their own business I mean we just we have a very long discussion with each couple are individual about what that's going to look like so we'll know how to solve it\nAnd make sure they have the money to last a lifetime so it starts with a plan and and and part of that plan is is the money side and then you know it's not just the money side by the white but that is an important part of the plan\nAnd so when you start thinking about it Tony what are we trying to accomplish in retirement we're trying to replace their paycheck\nThat it's as simple as that so how do you replace the paycheck well we start with Social Security\nSocial Security is kind of the bedrock of retirement in this country and regardless of what the suit Sayers and they do they say it's not going away it could certainly change it can look different it has many many times over its uh eighty year plus period\nBut uh it's gonna be there is too big and important a program to take away so we start with that and how do we maximize that and we take a look at the income gap or if you've got forty thousand coming in from Social Security and but you need sixty how do we plug the gap and so now we start looking at what we call the color of money\nAnd that is we divide your money up and this is actually a report we can do for you if you come into the U.S is let's see what color your money is now\nAt least see what color it should be\nAnd so there's three close to shoot to choose from the first is what we call yellow money all the money is cautious money and the reason you're cautious is it is very safe because there's money in the bank money and your mattress money credit union but it doesn't grow fast enough to keep up with inflation so therefore you actually lose money every every year so you have to have\nCash you won't liquidity but you certainly can't have everything there or you will run out of money due to inflation so that's the first money we want to kind of set aside and build on the second color money's called red money red money think of red equals risk I think of a bull charging at your or whatever so this is money to send the market\nOr some kind of market stock market bond market a real estate gold silver um commodities you know anything that can go up and down and we call this money our hope so money because this is money that\nWe honestly don't know how much will be there over the next one five ten Twenty years because of the market or you can look at all you want to but markets go up and down\nSo we use this money as a backup money we use this money not to pay utilities and rent and mortgage we use this money for vacation\nA for adding that deck on the back of the house or buying that new second home for buying a car\nFor for putting the roof back on my house and blew off or whatever is that stuff that comes along once twice three times a year where we need a bigger amount of money pulled out and that's our\nThat's those are fun money you know them to travel with so that's our backup our money our hope so money and they can go down with a bear market however uh we do have the private money managers and I'll be glad to discuss that with anyone that comes in to meet with us\nA due to time here on the radio but uh that's money that is a using private money managers that is actively managed and so what we're able to accomplish is in many cases were able to beat the S. and P. return with less risk and that's a pretty big deal because many many people cannot do that\nUh so we're seeing some nice results from that we've got a good track record on that uh so that's our fun money then the third back is what we called green money green is go green is income\nSo Social Security fits into the green money but also money that we want to protect and so what we use in almost every case for green money is money that will produce income so how do you produce in coming in today's environment where you can't really produce it very well using bond there down and actually losing money bond funds\nUh can't we use it for CDs they're paying nothing so we're using a fairly new hybrid indexed annuity that basically cannot go down the principles protected\nAnd also some type of a guaranteed growth on the income it's almost like a pension so every year you wait let it grow the bigger the pension 'em out\nSo if you open one in in in you know you want in your five you want to turn on income that's going to give you a guaranteed amount every month to supplement your Social Security is that screen money that's money that we have to have so we call that half\nTo money and so when we started to batting this or that have to money cannot be affected by beer market\nOr the hope so money which is red can be but we actively managed so we try to um make sure that we use the money managers that understand that and know when to go to cash or when to get out of the market\nOr when the more the barrier introduces itself and then of course the cash so it's a very I'm kind of a a a simple program but very effective and and we use that with every client and every plant will tell you they have a piece of mine\nI'm about that and they again I don't get phone calls I'm a very ... to make sure\nI don't remember this but just remind me I'll remind them they're like thanks good we're good thank you much uh and they're gone and so it's really a nice a process to use and uh again if you've uh you know if you're sitting there with a bunch of four one K. money and\nAnd you know you got Social Security but you're a few years away from retirement that's to color money report for you find out what color your money is now in what color it needs to be to provide a lifetime income and we'll be glad to do that for you for those that were not to come in for the consultation\nYeah and I think that's a great offers so you're offering a complementary\nThere's no costs no obligation consultation at least for that initial consultation a juicy words you know get to know you see where they're at you'll take a look at people's situations and and talk about some solutions and I know a lot of our listeners often call you\nWith questions about things they hear a stock about on the show and you're always a wealth of information and I know that the market volatility has some people concerned you know after hitting record highs they're wondering when the bottom of dropped out and we'll see another two thousand eight and a you know we want to be prepared right\nOh absolutely well I Hope I Hope you do I mean you know there's some just stick their head in the sand and say you know I'm just not going to look at it\nWell that that's a solution you may not worry about if you look at it but\nIt's certainly not going to look pretty when you get ready to retire and you're you're down twenty five percent or whatever it may be so again having a strategy is is so important and\nAnd don't we don't even have a plan for everything else we do in our lives I mean vacation or our careers that we were kind of have a\nA plan I don't you may you may not be detail but at least you know you know day one arrived in Florida a day to hit the beach day three go shopping day for a sleep light you know whatever they may even at least we have some semblance of a plan with retirement so many folks who just kind of heading that way and\nAnd you know there is some researchers out there the district Googling things and they'll find him an opinion on everything\nAnd most of those opinions are tied to something you can buy\nYou know from a newsletter I'll give you my opinion well okay is probably worth what you're paying for it you know um but you really need to know about your situation no newsletter no email can address your situation because your situation is different than everybody else is in this country\nI can promise you that I've never seen and never will see the very same situation\nSo therefore you need a different plan you need a different strategy\nAnd you know it's one thing to go on line it's they've tried it and do some reports or whatever and what I run out of money or whether or not run out of money and and you know Tony that's all based on assumptions you plug in one inflation rate you won't run out of money you plug in another one you will you plug in one savings right\nYou won't you probably get another one you will I mean so it was just playing with numbers and then so we can't do that we got to look at your situation and and do something realistic and actually see from history\nAs well as what is a guaranteed out there what we can accomplish for you and and so folks will take advantage we have said this before and I don't want to sound overly dramatic but we really are on a mission to really really try to help folks I Won at the end of my life to to have folks look at me and say you know if it had been for mark we would not have had to retire we've had\nHave already had people say that so hopefully they will wait till I'm dead but\nUm [laughter] let me know before them\nOn on you know before the epitaph in the obituary and all that kind of his stuff but it's a good feeling and that's important to me I grew up in this area was born and raised here or one of the few natives of his lab area and and so I care about the people here I care about the culture I care about the change is good and bad and and but I Want to make sure the folks here\nUm you know make it to and through retirement\nAnd have that kind of retirement they've always wanted they've always desired and that they can really realized that\nYeah and I think that's so important that were out of time for today's show what's that phone number one more time\nSeven seven o nine eight or nine to six to or do a Google Search or visit the website master planned retired dot com and I bet if you just plug in master planned retirement consultants\nA split the land up part use it for commercial purposes ah chop down trees do things that generally are the opposite of conservation so forward a charitable send someone that owns a hundred thousand acres\nOr might want to give away a couple of thousand for a tax deduction and to preserve land and legacy for future generations that was the purity of the tax law but we become a country full of cheaters in scam artist and\nA really criminality to some extent and I'm not I'm not labeling anybody here ... criminals I'm just saying in general we've become more of a propensity in this country to act in a way that is criminal or criminal why it listed\nA illicit if you will that nothing you can really depend on it's being represented anymore so when you when you're buying into a property that has attached to it recreational land for recreational only purposes in a tax charitable ease meant\n... conservation ...\nThen you presume that there's not going to be a for profit motive ever in the future for this it let me tell you that's an incorrect presumption because big rich landowners and developers find ways to either\nCheat the intention of the tax law legally\nOr outright just cheated and get away with it because there's a statute of limitations on conservation eight months of three years at the IRS doesn't investigate it then they can't come back when they finally uncovered seven years later and say well we're going to go back to you know two thousand eleven and we're going to take care of this tax fraud that you committed\nA now again I'm not saying that in specific to anybody I don't have any proof anybody's committed tax fraud but generally I Know that a lot of the developers and a lot of the builders and a lot of the big landowners commit tax fraud because I see cases that do get caught\nWithin the three year statute of limitations and they get put into tax court and I've seen him as big as forty seven million dollars in tax deductions it reduced by tax court judge to zero meaning you just ... the IRS you ain't getting crap right\nSo I look at this Mayor Bill de Blasio Trump story and say this isn't nothing burger this is an every day and America this is just big leftist hacking\nEach incompetent mayor de Blasio going after big medieval developer Trump and and all the shoes fit here for for the White House by the way to say the IRS has signed off on it that that that that is just that isn't disingenuous as a response which might be warranted by the way by this ridiculous attach\nThe Irish doesn't\nSign off on anything the fact that the IRS does an audit you may be signing off on it but that doesn't mean that you did something legal or illegal it just means that they didn't catch you\nThis is the problem the IRS is too busy with the small potatoes stuff people like you and me doing little audit here a little on it they're trying to find ten thousand dollars left under the couch\nThere's millions of dollars by some of the biggest political operatives in donors in this country and collectively tens of billions if not hundreds of billions of dollars it's being raped out of the federal coffers by literally cheating the tax law\nMeanwhile you've got mayor de Blasio this is not about holding the Trump Organization or Donald Trump accountable this is a political attack\nFirst of all I don't know how the valuation of a property as it relates to taxes let's talk about city and county\nThe city and county did sign off on it they sent a tax bill the Trump Organization paid it case closed if you didn't send the tax bill you can't go back for years and say well we've decided we think your value of the property you have because we don't like your politics three years ago is now worth twice what it was\nSo that said he really has no skin is getting the city has no skin in this game because we are talking about property taxes I presume that's what we're talking about 'cause what else to the city levy\nSo you're going to go after Trump and what is he going to accomplish by this he's going to go after a dead man Fred Trump or the Donald Trump's dad because the whole nature of this story about this tax and the New York times expose a has brought out ... is inherently what Fred Trump did\n... ... what do you ... the whole fact that he was a millionaire age eight well of course\nI Know I Know or someone that used to work for me it was a very good buyers age and then his grandfather was worth hundreds of millions of dollars if not I maybe it's a billionaire I don't know\nIt was a private guy so you really couldn't tell what he's worked but you could see where the gulfstream gee six and his pen houses and his uh waterfront properties and his shopping centers all up and down the eastern seaboard the United states of America is a very successful real estate developer\nAnd this particular person that worked for me to have trust fund and it was a it was seven attended the seven figures I'll I'll leave it that I don't get to private anybody's information here\nAfter he got to be a certain age it was his money so he was a millionaire at age eight to you know he was a millionaire at age to probably millionaire at eight Fifteen millionaire at age twenty but here's the thing that nobody stopped and says when you look at this guy now and say well he just inherited all that money that's why he's doing so well known\nDidn't he didn't have access to it you got a little bit of money when he was twenty five and he got the rest of it when he was thirty by that point he was already doing about it as well as I have because he had something to prove he had a family that was hugely successful\nHe had a family that had made millions and millions of dollars and had become real estate or gods and goddesses in terms of what they could do they could turn you know dust into gold in the sense of taking real estate in developing it and he had to live under that shadow he had a had big shoes to fill\nAnd he didn't want their help\nIn fact he he just five they're healthy despise living in that shadow he had something to prove and fortunately I had the the benefit of working with him for a number of years is is that is our lead buyers agent on our team\nAnd now he's a successful phenomenal producer in real estate sales and and brokerage or not because he had a silver spoon in his mouth but because\nOf the fact that there was a silver spoon available he didn't want\nHe wanted to earn it himself he wanted to be on his own now\nI'm certainly sure that he's not turning away and the money that he gets from being from a wealthy family but he wanted to do it himself and this is the thing that losers do in our country mayor de Blasio being one of the biggest losers and may oil ship of the country mayor de Blasio is a flat asked loser\nI Know liberals who now live in Atlanta who've been in New York for most of their lives and they tell you they can't stand the man\nHe's the type of crony idiot loser crook who continues to get elected to political positions of power throughout our country and they're going after Trump for political hit four hundred and Thirteen million dollars we're supposed to be upset about this we're supposed to be upset that Donald Trump is from a wealthy family\nYou're listening to the show I presume you're listening not to be enraged on Saturday or Sunday\nOr be polarized necessarily but you're listening to learn something about how housing and real estate work and let me tell you the fundamental foundation that\nI didn't develop this I was born with it because I gotta tell ya I Would be one of these losers if I had this jealous streak in me which is I've never cared with somebody else had in terms of money I never cared if people I've helped have become bigger and better than I Am\nI've never cared if someone wins and I lose because I'm going to figure out why last and not worry about why they want and figure out how not to lose again\nI have always been that person and I can tell you that Donald Trump does that person I've got a book on Amazon right now called the Trump in you\nAnd I I I tell you it is an extension of his very conversation especially if you're in business and trying to make something or or trying to you know spend the last ten years towards your retirement and do something good with the philosophy in that book it's on Amazon dot com the Trump venue\nPaper back in the candle and that book is about this about the fact that losers attack winners because they don't want to try to do or sacrifice what it takes to win\nAnd winners ignore losers and that's really what their stories about ignore the loser de Blasio and the tax attack because quite frankly our laws allow this cheating to happen Trump is attacks cheat\nI'm sure he is and our laws are allowing him to do it\nI Am nine twenty the answer had the opportunity to sit down and talk with candidate for Georgia governor Brian Kemp antenna match\nWill you absolutely I'm strong supporter of the second

about it but he did do some things in the tax plan he did you know why would a real estate developer and a real estate guy\nAnd I'm the same way at the same mentality Trump does I Know this why would he\nReduced the amount of tax adaptability on certain kinds of real estate as as he did and the Republicans did because they realize\nThat all they're doing is playing into the Democrats narratives with all of this that they're just giving tax breaks to the rich they know they're getting them and they know that that that these tax deductions or ... real value do anything and so they eliminated some of them I think that was a good step in the right direction but it was a minor step\nWe have a real problem in this country where whether you're running a bank\nWith ten million a hundred million dollars and assets or you're competing against the Wells Fargo Wells Fargo is always going to win 'cause they've got all the lawyers to figure out how to cheat the intent of the law you don't\nIf you're running a small brokerage of any kind for insurance real estate mortgage et cetera and trying to climb up it's there's too many regulations for good honest people to be able to\nGet a brokerage into lend money to get a warehouse line to give out good loans and do it the right way because well frankly uh there were so many people that did and look what they did they ran ascending near bankruptcy as a country so everybody that's honorable and integrity and that has ethics is forced to join a company that doesn't so that they can actually function\nAnd to turn a blind eye to certain things because you can't fight every battle\nWe see consolidation and telecommunications AT and T Time Warner CNN we see consolidation in the in the information network so basically all the

it's sad for me to watch it it's sad for me to watch what's happening to judge Kavanaugh whether he did what the woman forward accused or not I'm not going to say she did or didn't tell the truth I don't know maybe she has a version of the truth that she doesn't remember correctly maybe she's selling one hundred percent the truth and he's the liar I don't know I don't know\nAnd I have to not care because it's thirty six years later and it should have been dealt with some time in the past that's called accountability and it's not blaming the victim\nIs saying to people who will be victimized stand to hell up and fight because we're losing our country because we want we don't want to be embarrassed we don't want to have backlash we don't want to have retaliation well without backlash embarrassment in retaliation we don't have a country\nBecause when you attack a criminal when you\nWere so blow a crime when you point out a wrong in society whether it is legal or ethical or moral or all three you are going to face backlash and if you were unwilling to fight for our country in terms of the verbal\nBacklash you are absolutely destroying the legacy that people who lost

gets abused now in the real estate transaction and every layer possible unless they're in a house or ten people want it and then you can drive the bus if you've got one buyer right now that wants it and you're negotiating with one buyer\nAnd you're on your way to a closing table at some point with that one buyer everybody's going to take advantage of you as a seller that's what sellers don't get when they try to do for sale by owner and it's like open heart surgery by owner it's the same kind of thing you're going to die\nIn some your money's going to die some you're not going to lose all your money but you lose the money to otherwise you shouldn't lose what happens you pay that three hundred dollar letter in the buyer has a a a bad day and decided they emotionally can handle the purchase anymore you just bought a letter for three hundred dollars it's no good you got to buy it again the seller\nNot write the buyer ought to be responsible for that and that's one of the things that were working on and sellers contracts to protect ourselves from the closing attorneys they're so obnoxious their their staff or\nYou know at the pre closer that the post closer they have the the the closing coordinator and then there's always a fourth person with some odd ball title in there and nobody knows what everybody else has done are doing it's insane\nYou never talk to ... percent to live that sort of Johnston I said\nCan you just make it where one paralegal touches the vials from beginning to end and you need to be made available on the phone that you know we just call you\nFor big level problem oh yeah that's a good idea and so that's what they do it's great it's really smooth it's not frustrating it's not painful it service like it used to be Stewart in Johnston if your closing home when you're buying or selling with us for somebody else just use them [noise] um there's an amendment coming up in the hum\nOf election this November along with Governor and everything else I'm I'm pretty much the undecided three percent in the state on everything I tend to just vote no if it's too complex and pretty much on all these amendments I think that's what I'll be voting I I don't really want to give the government any more power\nWe don't need any more minutes we need fewer amendments we need fewer laws and regulations we don't need anything else written at the dome of dummies that gives them more power over us but here's one the forest land in timberland conservation amendment amendment number three on your ballot\nJust would revive the current law by ... classifying forest land conservation use property for add ... taxation purposes it would have ... a change to the math that method of evaluation for this forest land\nAnd it'll survive the provisions\nThey use I mean who the hell even knows what this means and I'm In the damn business sub classification for tax purposes of and the prescribe methodology for establishing the value of forest land conservation used property and related assistance grants provide that assistance grants related I mean who the hell writes this stuff\nFive percent of assistance grants maybe the doctors and retained by the state revenue commissioner to provide for certain administrative costs so in other words they're going to tax land at any level I don't care what level there is a tax on land it's going to be extracted and then there's going to be a portion of that money used to ... vote Georgia government for administrative cost\nYou know how I read this kind of stuff because when they use all of these big words you know these governmental bureaucratic words which us a little minions stupid people like you and they can't understand because we don't need to understand it just do what we tell you everything will be okay that's the government's mentality\nWhat they're really saying here is amendments three fourths timberland conservation were going to tax land\nAnd we're going to blow government payroll and when you create more administrators\nWhich means they're going to be in our way more often now that may be a little oversimplified but with big words that\nPeople when I was born in middle Tennessee we don't we don't have much education up there\nAnd a lot of our schools here don't either so I don't really need to figure this out I Need to know because as I read through it and take out all the big words I see more money for government bureaucrats to blow government that's it the only create an amendment for forest land in timberland conservation\nLet's stop allowing them to run a business operation on two thousand five thousand thirty thousand acres Georgia Pacific is a huge culprit\nIn this illicit scheme\nThe toilet paper empire yeah so let's um let's stop that\nLet's charge them tax is this likely would the guy running a business\nBecause after all they're cutting the timber down in order to sell overpriced toilet paper copy paper and the like it's a business it's a piece of land being used to grow trees to cut them down to send them to factories to make stuff\nAnd we're giving them a tax deduction why because they're not putting houses on the land we'd be better off with houses on some of the land\nBecause then we'd have the additional tax revenue from those properties so my point here is\nWe have a huge problem in the country let alone in the state of cronies taking advantage of tax conservation he's mints they buy a thousand acres or hundred acres or five hundred acres\nThey take the best property the most pristine property\nWith a natural streams and lights and they polluted with homes side by side where you can hand each other a roll of toilet paper from one window to the next between the home there's a tight and then they give up the worst undeveloped part of the land that no one's ever going to using the cows can't raise honor they roll down the hill so to speak\nAnd they get massive millions of dollars in tax breaks putting that into consideration or timber ease months\nWhere in the county cuts it's tax revenue in half or more than you pay for more for the schools you pay for more on your house you have the burden of the tax bill that they are not paying just disgusts me and it's all in the name of conserving land for future use no it's not\nIt's in the name of finding a way to come up with something that sounds really really hard to battle who doesn't want to save land for future legacy and use and an enjoyment for our kids and grandkids and our our generations ahead of us I mean that's just if you could say no to that you'd be\nYou'd be just an evil being right so they come up with some you know pretty little idea and then they create a tax avenue\nFor the rich people with powerful lawyers to screw our government and and then the state of Georgia wants to take what we want to take on the ministry of portion of that so we can administrate at the administrators were mistreating art minister ... no\n... no you don't get any more money you don't get the direct any more fun in fact\nWe need to undo we're allowing these forest land in timberland conservation people to do we just don't need to allow it anymore it's taking advantage\nOf the people who are working hard driving in Atlanta traffic every day for an hour each way to and from work paying their bills trying to live their life the right way raise their kids give them a future provide them a nice clean comfortable safe place to live and they are getting taxed out the ... and then you've got the big rich people\nThat that even some of which I'm hustling with right now that are that are literally using it to not only abuse the tax system\nWhether it's legally or illegally\nBut also to mislead people like me and others into thinking that this land is for somehow our benefit to hell with that it's not for our benefit it's for their pocket book it's being abused and it needs to be eliminated it's one of the reasons I'm not upset that\nHarbor and end of the rough waters so ah\nAnd take it from your feet are now [laughter] so oh you are anyway\nSo are you guys know our boys every week tell you the market's going to be up next week and sometimes it doesn't come true but well he says you're wrong you out of three times it does come through this week that is one of the an average ... well it's it's\nPretty easy if you know these protests ... of the stock market with your wife the or sixty six percent right up my wife would never told me I'm right one percent of the man not even want to give you one I don't do you have to show you got a husband and my hunch is that I get fifty one percent of the ...\nYou get fifty one percent when we're talking about his percentage of the he knows everything and I'm usually wrong I mean neat meaning any kind of\n... any kind of question and I'm like no that's not how it was it isn't even looking at and think oh he's right so it has a good showing in the show here\nFor the record on the radio waves shown a theory all is saying that her husband mark is right or a lot of the\nTime allowed us when we went back and wireless and I'd have a nowadays yeah but if you get fifty one percent of the votes as I say he's wrong he says okay\nLeader at your house and Senate or anything remotely like that and not even close yeah so that's kinda my concept to I don't I you know the Pentagon needed I'm and here's the IRS the way you guys out there if you ever want to win an argument with his wife there is one easy way to do it ... you know not what do you mean what what\nYou always say well at least a married better than you\n[laughter]\nSo there I mean house you can argue with that she'll think about it in a minute just the way it was I don't know I ... that's the least uh married better than you remember that and you're going to win it earlier smarter than right to write that down right yeah I was like\nIt's almost like a cut down thing that she doesn't have good taste\nYou let her work that out [laughter]\nAnywhere nice\nAll right so the market was down fifty bases points half a percent as when we carry anything I agree um we had\nHad a few interesting things going on uh utilities gained at one point five eight percent wire utilities up\nIn a week when the market is now ...\n... dollars right yeah usually you would think that um if utilities lead market something weird going on usually market is down when utilities lead a and the fact that they're positive when everything else has negative\nOr we saw the thirty year treasury actually gained Fifteen point seven basis points or point one five seven percent\nOr everything across the board gained a but we did have something that's been pretty rare lately we saw a steep learning curve meaning that the longer term maturity is on the treasury um\nYield curve meaning gained more yeah the thirty year the ten year more than the the short term the two years five years seven near opposite of what we've done thing absolutely yeah so I've taught several times about this on the air recently\nUh December we saw a a a difference between the ten year and the two year\nJust a February rather February of two thousand Eighteen we saw about Seventy eight bases point difference point seven eight percent about three quarters of a percent the ten year was higher than the two year a what we saw this week uh pushed it to about\nA push to much higher than it's been lately ah up around thirty\nSo you can tell we went from Seventy five down wanting yeah I've seen it on lowering twenty points for I think the last few weeks um we were around twenty three twenty four start in the week or so were were boosted you know we've got we've got about I don't know ten basis points\nThereabouts happened pretty quickly to didn't absolutely yeah and uh what usually you would expect a when the ten year treasury spikes higher though you increase is on the tenure in a in a man the portion of the business cycle it ran right now which feels kind of top I mean we've had\nQuite a bit of growth um we've got GDP recently a four point one percent which is a pretty significant growth\nUm ... what you would expect is a that's kind of a confirmation of growth going forward\nA I think it's probably a little premature to say that uh at the moment if if what we saw this week in you could move a was truly a confirmation of that growth but uh you know I it's definitely a a good sign normally but wind markets sell off its a\nHigher interest rates are usually they ah they eat into the um\nThe profitability of a business um cost of capital that uh businesses source to run their operations actually increases you know whether there and take it goes to send them to feel it\nOh it'll take a minute for them to feel it but the market is always forward looking it's true yeah so ah it gets built into the market pretty quick and that's what we saw this week so ah got a few other things that are out in the economy\nPersonal income rose point three percent in August a same mountains in July\nOr just a little bit less than the forecast point four percent\nUh but really there's there's not um you know a whole lot to talk about the pace of rental income growth improved a from point seven to point eight percent but these are all relatively muted a University of Michigan consumer sentiment\nUm consumer is still I mean I guess to to a corner phrase strongest horse breath\nCan we say that yeah everybody's got a job all of them\nAround bringing on you know shown come a point of ever heard that term as strong as ... have her wow ah I'm thinking maybe an hour ... when it when you talk about and breath and strength but usually not a good thing it's not like\nYou know anyway button but in this case it actually is a strong so a consumer sentiment is solid I'm finished a month and a hundred point one three point nine points better than August or you know current conditions are rated favor really at a hundred and Fifteen point too which is up for point nine points\nA consumer expectations also improved to Ninety point five which is a three point four so a current situation a little bit stronger than a\nThan that I'm a expectations going forward and that's the two components of a consumer sentiment that uh is measured by the University of Michigan um\n[noise] I assume manufacturing conditions remains solid and September as well uh I assume drop below sixty um but ah the index drop below sixty but manufacturing a declined\nUh from sixty one point three fifty nine point nine anytime this was above fifty it's actually still expansion area so uh all things considered steal a a a pretty good number one that we look at every week NBA mortgage applications\nAre held steady in the week I'm following multiple gains over the last few weeks a this is a weekly so there's usually a little bit of volatility you see a move around a good bit\nA total index stayed the same for pre previous week and a small gaming purchases was all set by a slight decline and refinance so ah when we saw interest rates\nMove or move higher in a previous weeks we saw some folks get out and refinance still amazing to me than anybody's\nAble to refinance and make sense out of it and usually you see them in rates decline\nThat ship left the harbor a long time ago you for a couple of years on the radio show before [laughter] before before ... ... I see we're still talking I'm not really [laughter]\n... year ah it doesn't take a whole lot to confuse me showing 'em there's plenty to like and I\nUh the uh September arise in non manufacturing which is a fancy way to say service index ah suggests the economy has plenty of momentum heading into the fourth quarter a increase from fifty eight point five to sixty one point six and these are not percentages it's just kind of a of\nA number on a meter if you will\nFind the retail is going to pick up obviously right in the holidays are coming and all that yeah it will\nAh they seasonally adjusted he sang even though even when you do get those bounces it's going to be relative to previous years ... um but at the same time yeah I mean here's the thing as long as the consumer as long as we see employment situation doing well jobless claims by the way with the best in fifty years last\nAh but ah you know when you see a jobless claims stomach really nervous unemployment low I mean what are we at three point eight percent I think and I have been for a little while\nUm it's it's a great thing that consumers consumer feels good about what's going on with their own um personal situation so um anyway\nAh as I mentioned we did have some a significant changes in the interest rate the two year will discover that went in\nAnd the ten the two year was up five point seven basis points are pointing zero five seven percent\nAnd the ten year was up Fifteen ... products only ten basic point increase in the ... which is a good thing for banks you would expect a probably looked All right ah technology is still just knocking the cover all football it's a\nA the horses were often owned by others who would purchase them and then uh you know the family just how's the horses are the ranch been in the family for three generations or last year ... grandfather passed away\nOn as a state had nearly no liquidity in taxes had to be paid to settle the estate so\nHere we are in a situation or even beyond um ... says last year so it would have been on the twenty Seventeen rules by a which would have banned the five point five ... around a figure right\nUm so are you still got to deal with that right ah and buy a liquid meaning uh\nYou can't you don't I mean if you want to keep the ranch you don't want to just sell it and uh take the procedures sounds to me like I'm calling Holly actually want to\nHang on to the assets so uh that may in case they got to scrounge up somewhere absolutely acts money well\nThere are other expenses to not just the taxes but you've got attorneys' fees you've got to administrator fees funeral expenses there are a lot of other costs that sure you need liquid assets to take care of some of those and some of them are immediate right yeah\nSo ah you know the only option they've been left with basically or at least in their own minds has been you know either sell the farm or we can take\nAlone I mean let alone and gossip armed potentially the firm's worth that much and maybe you take a loan um\nDo ... in as something of that nature if if the pre planning was there you know after the fact it's hard to plan for sure right the journal that full point planning I'm you know something that can be put in place if you're in a situation where you do have a lot of a liquid assets not a lot of cash\n'em or or you know acid or liquid sitting around such a stocks CDs whatever that you can't get access to 'em there is a life insurance option you can find life insurance on yourself to help pay for future liquidity right now that you know there could be an issue in the feature sure with having excess cash right\nAnd sometimes that's the least expensive the options to work very well there are so if you've gotten\nAssets that are actually more liquid you can uh\nYou can source those to ah create um\nA longer term fix maybe but in our germ you'd still almost always be in a spot where you'd have to borrow money to mortgage against the asset if someone left you in the spot right\nThe key to the conversation today though is how to keep from leaving those you love and the similar spot right exactly so ah it short of borrowing a you know you could borrow for for a short term fix\nA discover whatever assets are there and a very little that you could liquidate and keep the pizza ranch in this far in this uh particular instance\nUm but aren't\nGifting early ... you know you want us to stay in the family right start gifting shares of it early you know portions of of the ranch or something like that early\nUm you have to respect the gifts limits but if you start earlier I'm being able to transfer that ... out of your state right to get it below the exemption amount that's an option tail but of course that requires the pre planting we're talking about\nRight now and I think that planning is a little more extensive than just creating the wheel and saying I Want this property to be in my family forever and ever right if you don't do the liquidity part I'm easily\nIn a rough spot will guys let's take a real quick break when we come back we'll wrap up this discussion and the answer some

I don't know that one brain Iranian or owners say they're saying okay well I guess the cars were taping this there's yeah it'll be the pack a day that's national I could tell you that ain't no\nTalk of authors and how can you talk about a third day it's not even the same there who knows they did that they're doing around [laughter]\nThey hit earlier in the show that when you tell your husband met he's always right now I just I don't know why they're doing around the side of [laughter]\nI'll make sure he's less I appreciate your uh your attitude [laughter] All right\nPeter sorry about the whole problem so mistakes you avoid going forward one being house for they already know they are there and he said you know exactly as a bottom big people that haven't done that don't buy more just because the banks says you can\nAnd it made it was for them to unravel but mass right downside definitely a possibility and a good time to do it ... probably are\nInstalling the kids ... Jones is twelve hundred dollar ... I see it all the time it's hard to spoil a kid at it now and so that falls right into keeping up with the Joneses Joneses or you don't want to kind of training and start doing the same thing\nYou want to teach them good sure yeah it's yeah\nAnd then you're going to be you know where they are now showing you got kids one of the kids going to say when you go back on your word like yeah I Know what we used to say but going forward we're going to try that everybody be a little more responsible and they're going to say yeah mom do you say you said here happens every time\nAren't saving for retirement I Know it's a it's never too early but I'm going to say it's never too late either haven't started yet you might as well\nGet started and start right now our compounding yes yeah starting the earlier\nYou start much better much better than having to wait the compounding interest is a phenomenal thing\nYet and really you know in the thirties and forties the forties is your the usually the biggest earning power so you know if you're in your forties right now as you indicated that kids are getting ready to go to school you know maybe start thinking about downsizing they're going to be leading sure seems seems a little district obviously thinking about downsizing start socking money away now\nAnd we don't get the earning earning years you can play and it's\nJust possible put that excess you'll save all not paying such a big mortgage right put it in your retirement\nYep and that the covers the one in the next steps funding college yeah over retirement sometimes that's a mistake a lot of people make as well and we've set of many times you can borrow for college yet but you can't borrow for retirement that's absolutely true yeah and uh I mean\nIf you're in a real doc straits there's nothing that says that I mean you you such kids up will get them in a good school a with a a decent um\nCareer path beyond college and ah they could buy their own way through college years and sit down and talk with them now talk with them about their options yeah and and you know obviously if you want to break the uh\nUh the generational issue would show you have already talk your kids to this point or if you tell them hey look these are the mistakes that I made\nA going forward we want to do differently and we want you to understand why we're making these differences and we expected you would push it forward into the next generation is well that's a conversation always great\nYou know I'm\nAlso not protecting yourself with life insurance disability insurance not having those can cause major financial devastation so usually\nAnd they change over time you know when you're younger you need life insurance term policies generally to help get the kids to college get the mortgage paying if something happens to you but the reality is statistically you're more likely to become disabled and die\nYou know if they're not only will become disabled and you know now only could there be health costs that now that maybe the income goes to show you know you need to be thinking about that that is more devastating because not cavalier but now now you're kind of ... you know the income that they are but you're also pulling money from the household salary you know\nI'm you're kind of a drag on the on the income but you know so those are things to\nDefinitely think about you know and whatever you do try not to ever read your retirement or\nBy getting into a home equity line just to make sure that ends meet and your own I having a another mortgage applied on top of the one you're really not waiting in line at her and she didn't wear humor upside down and then he pulled money out of retirement\nAnd you can never make that up and there's the penalties for dating say if you're under ...\nAnd a half anyway you go from a big fancy house to house real quick right yeah absolutely last resort yeah and a coup signing for loans for the kids probably not the best idea either teach them to be responsible initially so that you don't have to go sign\nYou never know what kind of miss your kids can get you in a you know just coast signing\nWith them or things whether it be an automobile who knows what a loan for a new business I've seen those going before so um yeah trying to get the probably the biggest thing you can do from years\nBeyond being responsible yourself is try to raise some kids that have a little better head on their shoulders when it comes to finance and teach them early yeah\nHe'd plan like this sounds a perfect example of someone who needs plant up and down and go through it with a professional and put a plan in place to alleviate what has been built so far\nYeah no doubt and give them ideas as to how they can unravel the mess they might have made with the the situation I'm even current right All right so if you wanted a financial plan you could\nOut to Shona or Peter either one can help you immensely both or see if they use them just to note that runs this radio show a and picks a few stocks on the side here and there um but you can reach them it's seven seven oh four to nine nine one six six and guys since we don't\nHave a much time left let's let's go to this one question we had that we can probably would cover relatively quickly I'm\nFrom Shawna how 'bout that laws was not you know good um those are definitely a Senate ... okay my dad's bored to tears in retirement he wants to get a part time job I'm worried that this might affect to Social Security benefits what are the yearning limits showing you got that\nI Do so if you are working in retirement if you are full retirement age there is no limit how much income you can house okay so you're only penalize before full retirement age which is what again\nThe Fort well depends on your age though right now the age sixty six to ... ... it does so they have tiered it said that when you get older and goes elder Sarah I'm so it's depending on\nHow old they are and if he if he
