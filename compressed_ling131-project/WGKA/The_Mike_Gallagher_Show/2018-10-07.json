{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "In the inner person if we do not take charge over our will how can we didn't use our will\nTo the will of God we can't we're helpless worth evil spirit power in the in her purse\nThe book of common prayer tells us in is the seeking of our own will instead of the will of God that's the story in our relationship with God with other people and with all creation this calls for instance\nWe have to change if we continue to\nDo our will instead of the will of God our lives get messed up\nEverything gets messed up repentance is a choice saint Catherine ... know or roads are self will\nIs so subtle and so deeply rooted in is so covered with excuses and defended by false reasoning that it seems a devil\nWhen we cannot do our own will in any way we do it in another and they are all kinds of pre tax this calls for crucifixion\nThis calls for crucifixion we choose to apply glaciers to twenty ... says I have been crucified Christ and it's no longer I who live\nThe cries to this within the calls for crucifixion whatever that thing is we nail it to the cross\nIt becomes dead cruise the fiction it's a choice\nOswald Chambers is written the Holy Spirit has life and himself and when he comes in he energizes our spirit and enables us to will and to do if his good pleasure\nAs calls for surrender it's the spirit who enables us to do God's will not our willpower we have to surrender\nAs we surrender to him he empowers us to do what's right and what is good and what's appropriate\nSurrender is a choice\nNow there's this battle that's going on between the flash and the spirit it's constant and we need to choose repentance we need to choose surrender and we need to choose crucifixion again and again and again\nPaul describes it in glaciers five six thing this way and I I'm using the new American standard version because of the king James says it this way too it just makes it easier to understand\nBut I say walk by the spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flash for the flesh sets its desire against the spirit and the spirit against the flash but these are in opposition to one another so that you may not do the things that you please\nI understand that this way we're body soul and spirit here's my spirit\nIs the place where the Holy Spirit and well this is a place where I'm able to commune with a lower this is the place or God Speaks\nOver here is my body my flash everything it flows out of my sense is right here\nAnd here's the soul which consists of my mind my will my emotions my conscience my person now I've been program since the baby to make my decisions this thing to react to what the flash wants to what I hear what I see when I smell would I taste on and on\nWhen I became a Christian and the Holy Spirit began to dwell on me the spirit then begins to want to leave me and guide me and direct me\nBut I'm used to following the flash and so there's this struggle going on do I choose to follow the spirit to follow the flash and it actually says there are at war with each other\nTrying to get you to do what you should or should not do\nListen to this verse again with that in mind but I say walk by the spirit and you will not carry out the desires of the flash for the flesh set such desire against the spirit and the spirit against the flash for these are an opposition to want\nTo know this is why it's so important\nTo develop the power of your will if you have no will power how can you choose to do the things you've got\nYou can't you want he's lost before you try\nYou will not choose to repent you will not choose to crucified of flesh you will not choose to surrender\nYou can't\nDisarm us rights song forty per se I desire to do your will oh my God you're law is within the\nIs this your true desire to do the will of God Jesus said not my will\nBut I Will do you have the willpower to say that and be able to back it up not my will die will turn will be pleased to Joshua twenty four\n\nJoshua twenty four I don't have the page number but its genesis exodus Leviticus numbers due to run me Joshua\nJoshua twenty four\nJoshua has been the leader of the children of Israel and he's saying goodbye is days are numbered first one is says then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel and Shaq him he's some and The Elders leaders judges and officials of Israel and they presented themselves before God\nAnd then the next\nTwelve versus versus twelve or Thirteen\nJoshua shares basically what is the history of God's working in Israel from the time of Abraham actually mentions Abrahams parents and how God intervened and lead them time and time and time again [noise]\nFirst fourteen\nThan Joshua says now fear the lord and serve him with all faithfulness throw away the gods your forefathers worship beyond the river and in Egypt and serve the lord\nBut it's serving the lord seems undesirable to you then choose for yourselves this day and we will serve whether the gods of your forefathers beyond the river or the ... of the animal rights\nAnd whom land your living\nBut as for me in my household\nWe will serve the lower\nPeople didn't respond by saying yes they want to serve the lord and they don't want to be left out they want to serve God of course [noise]\nJosh of pushes them because they must be willing to serve him not just wanting to serve versus Nineteen\nJosh has said of the people\nWho are not able to serve the lord\nHe has a holy God he's jealous God he will not forget the rebellion and your sense if you say the lord and surf foreign gods he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an interview\nAfter he has been good to you but the people said to Joshua no we will serve at the moment in Joshua said you were witnesses against yourself\nThat you have chosen\nTo serve the lord\nYes we are witnesses\nTo serve the lord it's an act the window and each has [noise]\nThe will Artie I've given ability to

down there was a metal staircase you can see through this lab and that's where she became really anxious even though the flats only about maybe five inches it was a feeling she could fall through and she can sit down and so we work on walking up and down the stairs\nFirst holding on to the handles and maybe just one and then just standing there on one step without holding on any and she just learned that you could tolerate that discovered so step by step one by one you're increasing your level of intensity in terms of the anxiety tolerating discomfort tolerating uncertainty and learning

AM mountain time on October ... set the scene for us on exactly what's happening right now at the forty seven annual Albuquerque international balloon fiesta\n[noise] well it it's art kicked off day and we had a full mass dissension today was nearly all of our five hundred and sixty seven balloons and a box window effect was in play today so it really just the blues near the field there's still a few up even though it's warming up quickly and it has just been a perfect day for us\nBut wow that's good to hear it's high I think one of the things that we all think about whether we tend to the ... or not we seen these iconic photos of all of these ... going up and she just described yet and I think people you know we're all familiar with the teardrop traditional shape a land but there are some other shapes as well correct\nCorrect there are special shapes we'd have Ninety eight special shape allude to your including probably my favorite a new addition to fiesta does yours is ahead of van Gogh and it's a it's really a unique balloon\nFelt they really just ask you what does the person who owns that balloon in the shape of that event go do with the balloon when he's not entering it in the Albuquerque and mass balloon party\nThey actually travel around the world and go to different little events or we're obviously the largest and a general the premier event in the in the world as far as the league immunity goes but they do travel around and uh I Would say every two weeks or so there's a line somewhere\nThat sounds expensive who's paying for that\nAre particularly with that I don't know but it's often a tribe it's a love affair sometimes there's a corporate sponsor involved like we have candidates are presenting sponsor and their ... travels around the world year
