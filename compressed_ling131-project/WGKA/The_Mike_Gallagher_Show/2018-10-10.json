brewing over uh the country politically it seems like the more\nThe more we hear the more you can't you almost cannot comprehend how\nCrazy ... the Democrats are becoming and liberal\nI've got a video clip speaking of Mike online dot com you may want to watch this will play about four minutes so I'm going to give you time to if you're near a computer to go to Mike online dot com and see\nA fiery exchange between CNN's Don Lemon and the Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis over what constitutes a mob and at one point lemon got so angry he told his invited guests to shut up\nThis is how nuts the left has got their full of rage after judge Kavanaugh is confirmed\nTo the United States Supreme court they can't believe they didn't shut him down they can't believe some of these poll numbers and their expression it in ways that really reveal who they are Hillary Clinton for example\nA it was announced that bill and Hillary like a like a traveling road show all this reminds me of is like the Barnum Bailey circus\nThey're going to go from city to city touring together bill and Hillary Clinton I'm trying to picture what how people would react how the mainstream media would react to the announcement the Georgian Barbara Bush were going to go on a multi city ... million dollar tour\n[laughter] can you imagine what the Washington Post would be saying about\nAll the New York times or Don Lemon and and I I'm not kidding you want to get in and watch this video clip about two minutes away I'll play it or where things got very heated on CNN now again I say there's often\nCNN is really on the kids these days and and I don't mean that within ugly I mean I don't have a dog in my own I don't care who wins the cable news wars but it's a Fox News MSNBC cable news world right now she and that is it a distant third and\nYou're about to see why they put their face and a guy like Don limit who is just as it becomes on glued when a guest rightfully points out that\nDemocrat activists in protesters who ... a U.S senator out of a restaurant or indeed\nA mop Don Lemon doesn't think that's mob mentality Don Lemon is a Democrat\nPeriod but let's listen to the lady who almost became president\nEver so close show clothes she could she could feel that you could taste but alas\nShe didn't make it across the finish line the American people rejected Hillary Clinton and she still can't quite get over it evidently listen to what she said about Democrats\nRepublicans and civility this is a cut number eight audio courtesy of CNN\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the ... can start down but until then the only thing that the Republican whom to recognize average that strength\nAnd you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell the president\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nDid you hear the lady who would be president just threaten the country because that's what she's doing she's threatening the entire country\nYou better understand she's saying you can't be civil with Republicans\nNot until Democrats gained control of the house and the Senate she almost became president with that kind of mindset and of course thankfully the voters saw thriller hurt or call them deplorable hurt or demean\nMore than half the country\nWith the wave of her hand knows who she is and what she is but you're not going to have a Democrat in today's party condemn Hillary Clinton's comments you're not going to have a Democrat\nCondemned the behavior of these protesters who are hounding Republicans and conservatives in the public space chasing a Fox News channel personality through the subway in New York\nHarassing him trying to get people to to try to incite people against him\nTo know what would happen if these two so called Democrat liberal comedians who've a rash Brian kill made on the subway with the video rolling 'cause they think they're so cute if somebody stuck a knife and Brian kill made what they'd be saying that they took the video down by the way from their stupid no nothing cowardly site\nBut these are Democrats here's a Democrat Don women look at the check this video out\nLast night he's got mad Louis a Daily Beast column is talking about the behavior of today's Democrats again\nDon't get don't get fooled Hershey milk or by labels like antifa or fascists or even protesters right these are Democrats\nWho are ... hounding and harassing people in public listen to Don Lemon with Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis listen very carefully\nTo what a liberal Democrat host like Don Lemon has to say about this mob behavior from the Democrats\n[noise] is it my behavior no it's not ... people who are all that and they're angry about the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy of either we now\nHave before you jump into\nOkay I make a point I Can't make it even Iraq thing they have\nA you know you're you're making a point are you the moderator or the host or are you arguing\nThat liberal or a moderator and the host of this\nWell I tell you that you're giving up until it all I think\nThat I'm like look up the word mob and the dictionary definition\nUp the word modern the dictionary and you should also as a Republican look at the count the number and look at the ... or whatever it is you are whatever it is you are look at the constitution of the United states and it gives people the right to protest yeah and it doesn't say where you can\nPay into an angel will you please let\nUs OK okay if I have a drink so you can do whatever you want and you can leave the show if you want but let me finish I'm not well maybe my point okay well then shut up and let me do it\nAll right thank you very much in the constitution you can protest whenever and wherever you want it doesn't tell you that and you can't do it at a restaurant it doesn't tell you that you can't do it on a football field\nDoesn't tell you that you can't do it on a cable news show you can do or wherever you want them to call people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right it's just beyond the\nWhat a jerk\nAnd more importantly he reflects an attitude of today's Democratic Party 'cause nobody's condemning\nThat belief that that's not mob behavior to chase them a a husband and wife who just won an evening now to have a dinner\nI'm doing fine thanks my good my position is is um ... especially with the comment I'm Don Lemon now you can protest anywhere any time a this is I say we should take on a\nStronger position and give them you know it's like fire fight fire with fire and that means less show up at CNN\nLet's start the same tactics and you might not agree\nWhat they're going to be honest I didn't want to do what they are I don't I really don't I I push back on that respect we I Know how you feel that I get frustrated too\nYou know where you need to do you know where you need to go is the polls you need to vote because that's where the power is citizen screaming and people in a restaurant or harassing a broadcaster hits it's putting Republicans in

pressure and look at what point is that a bike back on Sunday our company or the other part of this thing was a tropical storm that this was going to go to at least a category three perhaps a category for that was a textbook case opposite affords forwards\nComing out of a pattern was spreading out for a member of Ford's was a very old storm when she reached the U.S east coast or they bought people they know about was was it her first three or four days she also exploded out there in the eastern Atlantic so this storm\nCame into a pattern that believe it or not I can't remember if I said if you like I said it to a lot of people I told him I see you in October again while because it was called the one more most likely to watch the curb the Gulf so this is part of the pattern recognition\nAnd believe it or not folks here at the linkage to cope with ... and the following winters wow I'm In ... was\nThat one way when you're so so tell me plugs autonomy pill fill what's that what's our winter going to look like\nIt's got a cold and store it costs\nMuch of the countries that are in the southeast yup yup so uh it's a big water but but\nI like that back to this yes this is this is a you know

see this pattern this is the same pattern that cause Gordon Albert Florence did the United states dig high pressure over the north east we call that the loop and then we'll wow and it's set up and it directs any energy aimed at the United states the tropics and where do you get developed it in the late\nSeason western Caribbean in the Gulf of Mexico so there it is all set up\nYou know I always get
