just one here's what new writes about the testimony and with Dr Ford said under oath\nHe writes Dr Ford has been manipulated by the Democrats who hit her letter making uncorroborated accusations against capital for over a month dragged her into the national limelight and urged her to avoid meeting with the Senate Republican staff members at one Point New rights\nFord said she couldn't meet because she was afraid to fly although it was revealed at Thursday's Judiciary Committee hearing that she has flown numerous times for vacations\nFord was put through all of this even though she could not remembering what House the alleged gathering an assault on her took place or whether it occurred at the same time no one she said was president has core operator her story her testimony was emotionally compelling it's clear that something happened to her Newt Gingrich rights\nBut she knows as a professional psychologist the thirty six years after an event people can vividly remember things that didn't actually happen if Kavanaugh he sets can be defeated by this kind of manufactured in manipulated evidence free process than what reasonable conservative would ever put his or her name up\nFor some Senate confirmation Newt Gingrich asks the real question is this are there any Democrats you are disgusted by this process of dishonest character assassination and manipulation or any upset that this was becoming their party's\nOperating pattern are there any Democrats who sense of decency forces them to vote yes for a decent man\nAnd brilliant jurist\nWhose entire public career\nHas exemplified honesty sincerity sincerity and patriotism are there any Democrats you understand that a thirty six year old on supportive allegation cannot possibly be the standard for blocking a U.S Supreme Court nominee if no Democrat has the courage to vote for decency honesty\nAnd a sense of fairness you said then we are truly in deep trouble as a country the focus for the next few days ought to be on the Democrats let us see what kind of a party\nThey have become the answer to Newt Gingrich has question I fear\nIs no there will not be one Democrat who will pull a Jeff Flake not one the Democrats are unified and trying to stop judge Kavanaugh\nBy any means possible it is refreshing it's gratifying to see moments\nOf the mainstream media called out and boy was a powerful over the weekend on CNN Jeff Greenfield been around for a long time political analyst he was a guest with Brian's shelter who is a Trump hater and a\nA huge huge media cheerleader for all things on the left\nHates Fox News hates conservatives and he's supposed to be there I guess their media critic\nJeff Greenfield said the Brian seltzer over the weekend on CNN and what was I think an epic epic takedown of the network that is now in a distant third place in the cable news ratings wars\nHave to say this quite bluntly new CNN anchor when I looked at CNN hour after hour after hour icy panels rather than reporting exchanging opinions the overwhelming majority of which on this network I regard as quite critical or hospital for ... now that may be justified\nA fascinating and he went on and so that was a much longer piece about how there's not a whole lot he says it may be these folks have concluded on I'm sure why that click click click the way it where where did but here's what he said well let me read the whole close and we don't have the full video clip I Apologize for that\nHe said I have to say this to a CNN anchor when I look at CNN hour after hour su panels rather than the reporting exchanging opinions the majority of which are on this network\nI regard as quite critical or hostile\nTo ... to Trump let me read that again hour after hour icy panels rather than reporting exchanging opinions the majority of which on this network I regard as quite critical or hostile to Trump that may be justified it made me these folks have concluded in the way that Trump has to be have that they deserve this pushback\nWhat you've described these two different universes has only been accelerate I've said this over and over again if you have a shred of fairness you ask yourself how can a CNN not have one single personality even mildly pro Trump\nYou ever think about that CNN says they're nice people CNN says there\nObjective like Fox News they've got opinion shows the good news people who'll blitz you're supposed to be a news guy put down the list John King and all this ... how can they not have one person on the entire network who dares to support Donald Trump\nAnd that's what Jeff Greenfield with same day after day hour after hour minute after minute all they do is trash the president of United States period panel after panel and\nI I guess the proof is in the pudding because Fox News channel last week\nThey've posted numbers for Sean Hannity show on Fox News\nIt was nearing six million people\nThat they don't get that and cable Fox routinely\nBeats the

you some reason to stay optimistic to stay upbeat\nUm the Dow Jones industrial average rose to hundred points today um investors are cheering the news of Canada joining a trade deal with the United states and Mexico [noise]\nUm [noise] the impending collapse of national NAFTA [noise]\n... is jak shah rights over hot air dot com it's not quite as big as big a deal as a Brexit but it certainly had President Trump's critics quite exercise over it\nNow however it looks like everyone can go back about their normal business after months of stalling and preening Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau\nCame back to the table at the eleventh hour\nAnd agreed to join us in Mexico in this deal last minute trade deal reforming NAFTA just what the president wanted huge victory and as a Peter Navarro put it\nThe president has put together the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern history that's not hyperbole\nAnd it matters because it affects every single one of us and affects every one of our bank accounts it affects every one of our retirement or or four one K. is our paychecks\nHere's a Peter Navarro this is a cut number one again just two minutes of good news in a sea of bad news 'cause there's nothing really good about the cabin offshore nothing all we can do is hope and pray\nThat\nThose senators come to their senses the cabinet gets confirmed\nAnd it's crucial because this involves way more than just one man has a lot more to do\nThere's a lot more at stake than just Brett Kavanaugh will get into that and just a couple of moments as well but I Want you to uh she the White House trade advisories on Fox News over the weekend it's just cut number one here is the way Peter Navarro describes what President Trump has done with our economy and pray\nPresident Donald Trump is very quietly been putting together the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern history [noise]\nAnd ah it's it's really truly extraordinary and I think quietly because the media has under report in both the actions we've taken and the results and exiting the day is this last week the United nations were president ... traded a groundbreaking deal with South Korea\nOpen negotiations with Japan and work with our allies in Japan and Europe to issue strong statement against the behavior of China\nNow now if you need any proof for about a corrupt\nNews media all you have to do is acknowledge what Peter Navarro says about the way the media has under reported all of this\nHuge news it's the Trump keeps winning I Know Trump haters\nHate to hear that I Know it makes you crazy to hear that\nIt's a fat he keeps winning he's not pulling the Dow out of his ear okay he's not making up the unemployment numbers\nWhich is not a tweet from the president at midnight these are facts and um [noise]\nIt's part of why they're threatened by um it's part of why the left is so desperately trying to stop Brett Kavanaugh they figured this will be a major defeat for the president it will be incidentally if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed let's start with one of the big takeaways of the last few days\nOf the biggest takeaways is watching this stunning\nUm crowing by leftists and activists and progression lives over the weekend on social media about how getting in people's faces screaming at them ... them cornering people like Jeff Flake\nEffect change this is why we do it\nThat's what based Ana Marie Cox all these other folks got on social media this is why we get a new faces because it works Jeff Flake caving and Jeff Flake changing his mind after he will be raided by the activists\nIn the elevator and they are activists I don't know if they were sexually assaulted and if they were my heart goes out to them as my heart goes out to any victim of sexual assault the Christian plaza sea Ford was sexually assaulted my heart goes after\n\nAnd as the president said her testimony was compelling what makes this on fulfilling for everybody is the fact that judge Kavanaugh's testimony was compelling as well\nIf you are wrongly accused of such a horrific thing I Would think you'd react with the world watching precisely the way he did without a doubt and so we are left with a he said she said here's a major takeaway\nIf Kavanaugh get derailed and the confirmation fails\nIs open season on every Republican in public office it is they're going they're going to because they believe that getting into somebody's space and shrieking and screaming and berating somebody in public works that's what Senator Jeff flake gave them on friday\nHas to know it can't be a stupid man and a word about Jeff Flake before we open up our phone lines and we dive into all of this here on a Monday as we get ready wrap it up for what's going to be undoubtedly a very tough week worried about Jeff Flake raging about him is as productive as complaining about the whether\nHe is who he is\nHe admitted on sixty minutes last night shockingly but he would have never changed his mind the way he did friday if he were up for reelection he\nTold the world if I had any accountability here I'd never do this he thinks that's a good thing he he thought that was good to tell Scott Kelly of CBS sixty minutes but if I had been up for reelection I would've never partnered with\nChris Coons from Delaware my buddy and I would have
