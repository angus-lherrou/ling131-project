outlet online huge savings on the items you need and want it's a big deal the outline online dot com\n[noise]\nStudios it's her\nVoice challenge but eager to talk on my next guest David Evans he's the director of the brand new movie in the visible which will be in theaters this Friday it's the true story of army chaplain Darren Turner a David Evans welcome to have you on the Hugh Hewitt she'll tell us about indivisible\nThank you yeah it's a it's a really hear the first movie ever made about a military chaplain you know there's been chaplains that have been featured with with supporting roles and movies over the years but um I've heard about this story about chaplain Darren Turner and his wife for about six years ago\nI'd taken a long time to get this project put together but I'm really it's an incredible story that I think will appeal to your listeners when you can see what troops experience during times of deployment through the eyes of a chaplain who's really kind of like the pastor to the troops but when you see first hand or the experience of what they're dealing with\nAnd then you know at the same time their marriage as well as under attack as it is so often with with our troops when they leave their husbands and wives behind a just a powerful story of of of the people who whether you're married or not it's a story that's really going to speak to you um when you see this film\nDavid Evans I've got lots of military in my family and I have heard it said again and again I'm a civilian but I married a Marine Corps brat and which is lots of military\nActive duty that whenever a soldier sailor airman or marine Corman go off on deployment they come back a different man or woman and their spouse is a different manner with and then they laughed I Do capture that in indivisible\n... absolutely in in a in a very vivid accurate way I Believe we use that chaplains actual journal that he kept while he was in Iraq so we kinda get into into what they're going through by by reading his journal and and then incorporating that into our entire script you know it's so often that\nI'm as Americans we take for granted the freedoms that we have and it's really about one percent of the population that that's connected directly to the military through a spouse who's serving or having a child who's an active duty versus other Ninety nine percent of people that I think really are going to appreciate the story\nA yet yet got entertainment value of their great visual effects and and a score but it's the it's the deep rooted story about what our troops are going through that I think will really speak to people\nAnd um I'd like to also and you it's a perfect date movie if there's a husband and wife out there and they're your your your listeners are looking for something to do this weekend or you know you can cast a vote for or faith based quality films like this by going to see the movie on opening weekend it's a perfect\nPerfect film for for husbands and wives to go out and watch together\nAnd this is the studio that also brought a fireproof and more roommate rarely succeeds they make wonderful movies as says of course David Evans it got very experienced directorial credits but what strikes me as especially\nIf you have a member of the military and your family whether it's a son or daughter husband or wife grandma grandpa anyone who deploys I Want you to go see this movie so that you understand what you're friends with someone you go to church with someone who's got a spouse deployed\nUnderstand how hard it is for that spouse as well as for the frontline soldier sailor airman marine coast guard but that\nIs you know I think indivisible has got a lot of great stuff going for it was Sarah Drew and Justin ruining in David evidence but what's really got going for it as an audience that's going to finally see their lives reflected on the screen\nYet she which we've heard that over and over again from some of the military screenings and and community screenings we don't already is people say that was me in that scene I saw myself on the screen\nAnd you know with Veterans Day coming up just a couple of weeks away that's a great opportunity for someone that you've seen the film that say you know what I Know someone who needs to see this and go out and\nGive them a ticket and say thank you for your service and it's something that that really all of us needs experience because it's not so often that like this film can come along based on a true story of a military couple\nUh especially one told you the odds are chapel and\nI loved the alliance defending freedom great sports of our show has a separate group devoted just to chaplains and chaplains very rarely get the credit which they ... they are in every battlefield they're on every front line taking care of the men and women in the troops and I'm Glad someone finally made a movie about and David thank you\nThank thank you so much yeah it's it's an important role in like you said one we often take for granted but in the case of chaplain Darren Turner he's in Iraq dealing with\nThe problems facing a thousand troops\nAnd ah you know his own relationship against to to deteriorate with his own spouse and that's what we see kind of play out in the film and how how um they're able to piece things back together and and today they go round counseling other couples that military marriage or treats around the country which is another great thing that people really are not aware of that happening\nThe hash tag or the Twitter feed is

Jeff Zucker issued a statement after\nThese pipe bombs were received and it's really they were thankfully harmless there is no real apparent literal physical threat with these pipe bombs\nNonetheless hours after ... New York city headquarters were evacuated the networks president issued a statement\nCondemning not the bomber knocked a maniac who did it not the lunatic who would or the whole stir or whoever whatever word you want to use\n\nThe blame President Trump but the White House and Sarah Sanders saying they should understand their words matter in other words CNN can call Donald Trump Hitler all day long and there's no accountability there\nBut as soon as some maniac sends the suspicious packages and these pipe bombs to all these prominent Trump haters\nThat Trump's fault\nThe state been continued the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter much more they have shown no comprehension that now let me tell you what has to happen let them do this\nDo you dare do you go\nDown this path normal Americans are seeing this garbage sheen Trump blamed for everything from hurricanes literally\nTo pipe bombs kept my aunt birth is get out and you know what America is going to go to the polls and reject the left\nThey're going to send a message to CNN and the Jeff Zucker is of the world you're not going to get to win this thing\nDon't you dare go down that same path please I Am begging you don't say you think the Democrats did this as part of a hoax I get that I understand that I appreciate that\nDon't make that mistake let the facts come to you if we find out and they'll catch whoever did this\nThey find out this was some kind of a Bernie Sanders supporter like the guy who tried to kill the Republicans on the baseball field if we find out this is a member of a you know Planned Parenthood or this is a Democrat operative trying to create havoc\nBelieve me the floodgates elope it people will then say look at what they did\nBut if they sign that it's a conservative who hates Trump or I mean who hates the media and hates Democrats and loves Trump then guess what the floodgates open on us and you know what may happen\nPeople are going to say well look at all you people who said it was a Democrat hoax\nThey're already saying that I'm reading Charlotte's around Mike Allen overt Axios there is a conspiracy theory being perpetuated by radio host all over the country\nWell not this one I'm not going to do it I'm not going to stop you or stifle you from saying what you want to stay and believing what you believe\nBut we got too many people\nWho are so quick to blame\nThe president for everything including\nRepublicans ... Republicans\nLike the governor of Ohio John casing the man who would be king he wanted to be president so badly and he sits down with his buddy over to MSNBC Brian Williams this is number three from MSNBC and gravy\n\nTrain does and that's part of the reason why I never endorse them and I've never been personally critical of him about yeah he does bear responsibility for the divisions are as the biggest megaphone as\nJohn Case ... says sure he does\nDonald Trump does bear responsibility for the for\nThe uh the tone of America John Cage that has never gotten over the fact that this fighter\nBeach here John chase the kids never recovered from the fact that Donald Trump has fought in a way that we have never seen the president's fight in our lifetime and Burr John Case he doesn't know how to play ball that way that's why John Case it lost\nIts why he will always be a failed presidential candidate\nAnd all of these people who have been beaten by Donald Trump will just sit on the sidelines like little like little pesky maps and try to bite and ... and nip away at the president of the United states\nIt's disgusting it's this dusty\nDesk what lifted Trump haters do it Americans are going to go to the polls in less than two weeks in about a week and a half Americans going to go to the polls\nAnd they're going to push Republicans across the finish line in the Senate and then the house and the gubernatorial races were not going to see a blue wave we're going to see a red wave\nAnd I beg you not to contribute don't don't snatch defeat from the jaws of political

I got the screener and watched it you got some heavy weights you got some some real real powerhouse actors and actresses in this film\nWhere really do in order to tell a story like this you need to act or is it a lot the performances in a in a meaningful realistic way and\nAnd Sarah Drew and Justin ... who some of your listeners will know from a great show team a TV show Grey's Anatomy oh he's got other actors there as well come along and support them and and really pull this off and on meaningful way\nYou know I I Love your story I've been reading about ... you began shooting homemade

creating a movie in again with the culture we're up against right now and some of the tough things we're facing um I I got to believe that this is your life's work or providing an alternative to people from some of the junk that we see a on the big screen these days\nBut last year\nI guess David we got you know what happened to us that we got a little bit of a technical problem I think um this this I mean there did you guys back I got your back now\nSo I'm Sorry about that David we apologize I we were just talking about the alternative a movie like indivisible which is such a different refreshing change of pace from some of the garbage that that is in Hollywood frankly today and I know this has got to be part of your life's work to provide some inspiration for a change\nRather than some of the depression things we see on the big screen\nThat's right it definitely is and again you know when people go out and watch a movie like this on opening weekend it's really a vote or casting for more\nPositive content that you can share with your families on the big screen and uh so often we see movies like this will come along and they last about a week or so and then it's like who are gone but when you have a true story like this first of all it's a story about soldiers that are fighting for freedom it's a well acted well\nProduced Feldman M. we want people to get out and support that movie on opening weekend you had a boat for more movies like this and it's so important and\nKeeping the movie around as long as we can sort of like getting out of supporting it an opening Lincoln it helps everyone is working on projects like this to step forward and keep pushing to to get their pills added ...\n... is that better myself even even I even liked the gators instead of

reading\nAbout if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the ... started to\nShow known by the most famous man on the planet\nAnd you've been great Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly\nYou know from the relief factor dot coms duty over my head like\n[noise] we are in the middle of an incredible time [noise] the president tweeted today a very big\nPart of the anger we see today is our society is caused by the purposely falls in an accurate reporting of the mainstream media but I refer to as fake news has gotten so bad and hateful but it is beyond description mainstream media much clean up its act fast well the mainstream\nMedia doubles down and says this is all his fault these pipe bombs at least suspicious packages that have been sent to prominent Democrat critics of President Trump um we've had a voice of reason in this country lately\nUh last night you know in a room of about a thousand people\nIn Irving, Texas\nRight outside Dallas we had a an event on stage where Sean Spicer my colleagues Larry Elder Dennis Prager Mark Davis and I\nWere talking about all of these important volatile issues\nAnd I mentioned the name Senator Lindsey Graham and a roar went up the likes of which I haven't heard in a long time I know you feel in love about everywhere he goes because many of us\nBelieve that we're not for Lindsey Graham's passion and his heart felt anguish over the way the process of judge Kavanaugh played out that\nHe wouldn't be justice justice cabinet today what a what a joy to bring back to the my Gallagher show Senator Lindsey Graham from the Palmetto State of South Carolina Senator Graham what a time to be alive ha\nAm I I'm trying to make the guy that won the lottery I don't know who he is but I'm trying to find it\nBut he's in your state right I mean listen can I all I Need ten million if you if they meet him and you get five I'll take I could do five or seven and you know we'll be All right [laughter] well you know if his\nOr try to get mine and I get more and so that's\nA good bill kidding I write he'd get fringe group he got three groups and you get one of ice cream Senator Graham on us to do this last last night I mean here we are in Dallas texas and here's hundreds and hundreds of people\nRoaring their approval for just for your name were so appreciative of your voice and and I I just got to get the Lindsey Graham\nThirty five thousand feet view of of what the of the time we're living in this investigation is intensifying these suspicious packages CNN's Jeff Zucker immediately blamed President Trump's what is ... what is Senator Lindsey Graham say about the last twenty four hours of this very nervous a dangerous time\nWhere you take your frustrations out at the ballot box you support your team are so portrait causes appropriately I don't blame President Trump for this any more than I blame Bernie or the guy who shot states glass and tried to kill a bunch of congressman Rosa Bernie supporter but Bernie doesn't support that\nOr this person is obviously sending bombs to critics of the press that that's not the way we do business in America hope that get caught hope they go to jail and I hope and about Thirteen Days republic when at the ballot box because we deserve to get reelected\nAnd that's the answer the only answer we have we got to be the the the we got to have a big boy parents on we can't pull a all around and and point fingers of blame so wrong time to do this because frankly Senator Graham seems very clear Republicans have a great deal of momentum heading into November ...\n[laughter] no question about it I'm so Kevin uh I think what people were trying to say to you and to myself when I made them is it thank you for speaking a thank you for speaking\nIn a in a fashion that if I were there I Would have said the same thing less than what they were trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh who I've known for Twenty years as destroyed his life to keep the seat open\nTo make sure that Democrat could fill it in twenty twenty they actually said that\nThey play dirty and they lost\nI'm Glad I called them out I had all I could take a voted for ... not because of what I chose them but that was I thought they were qualified Thurmond voted against birds or ... or ... to people from South Carolina the game's played differently now and what they were trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh hope it\nI Hope there's a backlash at the ballot box and I hope we pick up seats and they get punished for what they're trying to\nDo you mind if I asked if I go a little person would do because of you for a long time and I respect we knew it all on you know that all the years that that I've been on the radio I said Senator Lindsey Graham is a good and decent man I met you in Washington DC early in my talk radio career you told me something that stuck with me you said Mike I came to Washington\nNot to say no to everything I Want to get stuff done I Want to get things across the finish line there's a belief and I and I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings are a big because I respected admire you and I knew for a long time there is a bully that with your friendship with the late Senator McCain\nYou were sort of restrained a little bit and with his passion is like Lindsey unleashed its Lindsey Graham the way South Carolina south Carolinians have known him for many many years is there any merit to that Senator Graham\nNow people are thinking way too hard ah here's the deal or if you know anything about may have tried to be a supporter of an independent judiciary our our judiciary needs to be independent of politics\nJohn McCain was my dear friend he voted against ... cameras hard ass when it came to judges [laughter]\nSo the bottom line as\nI could have never done\nTo sort of mind Kagan what they were doing to Brett Kavanaugh they were misrepresenting his life they betrayed doctor for it and there's no doubt in my mind something happened at the airport but I don't believe Kevin had anything to do with it or they tried to ruin his family\nAnd they said if you're really innocent or not you asked for this charade to continue and that's when I lost it is when Durban\nAsk Kevin out attorney Don McGahn the White House counsel if you really have nothing now I wanted to ask for this to continue they presumed him guilty not innocent everything that I Believe in as a lawyer or was was basically trampled on\nAnd I pushed back and it's still more complicated than that\nWell we're ... on a nation is grateful for you and your push back many believe I mean is it is it an overreach to say that that that that your voice your speech your passion helped the confirmation occur\nWell here's what I Would say number one I Want to congratulate President Trump for picking Brett Kavanaugh who's the great legal mind of his generation his resume of being a judge was unquestioned is integrity he's just a great guy I think what happened\nIs that I gave voice to those on our side who said enough already runs it always are judges Mike why is it always Clarence Thomas and board and Alito and now ... why is it all up to our people right and they weren't\nThey wanna went too badly over there playing pretty it's a Republican I'd done this to mail democratic nominee we'd be crucified\nOh we'd be this really ...\nFor these people can you imagine if there's a democratic male dominated lady from South Carolina\nDumps demand gives me a letter and I sit on it never shared with it the committee said to me if I recommended a conservative lawyer never told the lady from South Carolina oh by the way the Democrats would come here to meet you there'd be a riot and the street a quarter of the press so so I just got mad I was pissed\nI Know you were and they make about it that get tests to get so hopefully with\nA well we know he's ... he is just as bad but I mean that battle with the war and and he's on the Supreme Court and maybe there'll be another conservative one of the Supreme Court\nUh in in over the next ... years Senator Lindsey Graham is with us let me ask you about the big burning issue though I think is the October surprise we've got thousands and thousands\nOf people in what's being described as a migrant caravan um a lot of people are concerned as much as ... as the country is in ... in love with you right now there are a lot of us should have pushed back a little bit on on the issue of illegal immigration and and you have been if you've been an interesting\nI bet it interesting voice in all of this where do you stand right now with these thousands of people who are marching towards the southern border\nUh and and and frankly I think from a political optics point of view something that is encouraging Republicans and independents people to go to the go to the polls and say we can't have open borders we got to have sovereignty we got to have a secure border what's your take on the the migrant caravan Senator Lindsey Graham\nOr between Kevin on the care of and that does that make you want to vote is Republican nothing ever will bigger an independent voter our hope you will come on our side\nI'm going to be practical when it comes to solving the immigration problem within our country if you've been here for decades and you got American citizen children uh them will treat you fairly you'll have to learn our language pay a fine get in the back a line\n[noise]\n\nTwenty seven minutes past the hour it's great having you here on the Mike Gallagher shows a busy day we're in
