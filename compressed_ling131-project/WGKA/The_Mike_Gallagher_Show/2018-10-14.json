{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "Confession of mice and to the lord that sometimes you and I are attacked by what I call faults guilt\nThoughts guilt you've confessed your son to the lord but you still feel guilty\nYou haven't forgiving yourself or maybe you had a mom or dad who told you how bad you were I Would never forgive and so you carry around guilty even though you're not guilty because it's been programmed into again and again and again\nHere's where we have to rely on the truth of God's word you take the scripture and you claim it for yourself first John one\nNine says if we can ... our sins God is faithful and just and we'll forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all on righteousness and Romans chapter eight versus one into\nThe apostle Paul says there is now know condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus because through Christ Jesus the law the spirit of life has set me free from the loss and then that\nGod is forgiving you in the name of Jesus Christ\nBut then there's more to keeping the conscious clean sometimes we have to make a confession of one soon or arson to a Christian friend confession of arson to a Christian from\nJames five six team therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed the prayer of a righteous man is powerful ineffective\nSometimes you and I needed an accountability partner someone who we trust someone who we can share our sins\nYou see when you hold your sense of yourself there's this power over us that's broken when we confess are sent to another person it gives you an incredible freedom in Christ\nNone of us is perfect no one hears without sin but sometimes arson can gain of power of intimidation over us\nWhat if someone finds out its screams at us or whatever it might be the accuser accuses in attacks you to have a deer Christian friends you can listen to us and pray brings healing\nSays proverbs twenty seven seven ... says as iron sharpens are and so one man sharpens another\nSharing my thoughts with a Christian brother or sister but there could be more to keeping the conscious clear sometimes to keep our conscious clear it involves confession of arson to administer\nThere are times when we need to hear from our authority in Christ that God has for giving us for what we've done there are times when it's appropriate to bring a matter to the pasture and have him pray for you\nFor some people this can be very helpful in clearing the conscious yes God promises to forgive us in Jesus Christ of my ... to him but there are times when they hear our forgiveness from our authority and the lord that were assured of our forgiveness\nThis is what king David did when Nathan confronted him and what did Nathan tell king David when he admitted his then second Samuel twelve Thirteen Nixon replied the lord has taken away your sins you're not going to die\nHe assured him of his forgiveness\nAnd then they went on and told him about some of the consequences that we're going to happen because of his\nSometimes to keep it clean conscience we need to confess arson to our spiritual authority\nThere's one more thing about keeping a clear conscience sometimes in order to have a clear conscience\nWe need to make restitution when it's appropriate make restitution when it's appropriate what's restitution restitution means repayment returning the money compensating for something there\nAre times when they don't want her to get our conscience clear we need to go to that person and pay back what we stole our return what we have borrowed or fix what we have broke whatever the wrong we should attempt to make it right\nRemember Jesus ... remember he was went to his house for dinner and ... was so overwhelmed that the love of God he began to repent in terms of the lord and what did he do he began to make restitution and live Nineteen versus eight\nHe said that if he had cheated anyone he would rip pay them four times the amount\nRestitution whatever the wrong we should attempt to make it right\nAs a child in the sixth grade I was in the boy scouts and as a fundraising project we had to sell light bulbs now has given my allotment and went around all the neighbors and I saw the light bulbs\nThen my mother needed some money so she borrowed the sixty two dollars that I collected selling light bulbs\nAnd then we abruptly moved I may have told you before that my mom was a hippie from the sixties and seventies so we moved around a lot the money never get repaid\nDuring my freshman year of college I was praying and I was asking the lord if there was anything I needed to make amends for and like a lightning bolt out of the blue comes this memory of these light bulbs and the sixty two dollars that have never been paid back\nNow is Eighteen to get the time and that happened when I was ten so that was about almost half my life and of course at that age that forever and I hadn't thought about that but all of a sudden it just came right in and I knew\nThat I had to pay the sixty two dollars back so I got in\nMy car I drove up to north Georgia and I found my scoutmaster ... lived in the same house\nAnd I would pay the money\nIt's called restitution [noise]\nWay to keep our conscience clear\nIs to keep our sins confessed [noise] whether to God sharing it with our neighbor\nTo pray for us and making restitution when it's appropriate\nConscience [noise]\nIt's a mighty gift to the lord that he has given us\nIf we listen to it\nIt will save us a lot of heartache on the path of life [noise]\nIf we ignore it [noise]\nWe walk ourselves into deep and much trouble [noise]\nI Want to encourage you to work\nOn getting your conscience clear\nI Want to encourage you to make it your goal to be able to say is the apostle Paul in second Timothy chapter one verse three I think God whom I serve as my father's did when they clear conscious [noise]\nCan you say that I mean think about this and then it can you really say\nI think God whom I served\nWith a clear conscience is your conscious\nChallenging this morning\nTo work on having a clear conscience\n...\nNow we are joined in Studio ... fully beach Foley when I hear you talk about the Syrian conscience it's a\nIt's a very frightening thing as a believer when we look at someone like David who is a man after God's own heart and that happened to him can you give us hope for many people who may be listening they feel like their hearts are seared or their heart is hard to do things with the lord they know in their heart\nThe life they should live but yet we're content to live our own way\nOr the sad thing is if we continue to live our own way than we end up with a broken life like David did where he literally a\nFew go read the story he was such a broken person or that there were days upon days where he looks like it in and get out of bed a and that's not what God desires force and if we will um abide by what God asked us to do it always brings blessing\nBut our conscience begins to play tricks on us when the flesh and our emotions desire of things that we shouldn't have\nAnd so as far as hope for the person who turns to Jesus Christ he will give you power through the presents the Holy Spirit a but there are going to be those times where we have to choose\nChoose to this day I'm going to assert among them to serve the need to my flesh reminding us or what I Know is right and what the lord wants me to do\nAnd that choice can make all the difference in the world\nHow this is fully beach and I want to say first thanks for listening to it works in the lord today and I hope this program has minister to you\nOr we are so grateful that you're listening and I just wanted to ask if ah if this is spoken to you in any way if you just let us know or send me an email\nOr write me a letter germ you'll have that information and a few minutes\nBut also if you've got questions or if there's something about your spiritual life you've been wondering about and you just need somebody to ah to talk to about it feel free to send a letter and either a meal or or someone who's\nSkilled in the area that you're asking about we'll we'll send you a response but again thank you for listening and I asked the lord bless you this day\nAll my friends I'm Dennis prayer\nI watch actually I listen to Mickey Haley's [noise] conference with the president [noise]\nWhere it was announced that she was leaving the United nations at the end of the year she had already pulled the president this [noise]\nTo the I don't know when the ... was it made clear several months ago Romney so they're speculation as to why is she leaving because of course nothing could actually happen for overly innocuous reasons\nSeems to me that two years in the United nations or one should be up for a monument\nSomewhere in the capital especially if you're confronted the bad guys of the world is Nikki Haley has and I was ... by during the eight years abroad Obama\nAnd keeping true to a major left wing attitude toward life you\nWhen you don't fight this is an ancient tell music phrase those who are cruel to the kind or oh better those who were coming to the crew will be cruel to the kind\nThat is a motto of or deer fellow citizens of the left ... liberals but on the left and that is\nThat they are kind to the cruel like the Iranian regime and they are cruel to the kind like Israel\nThat's a perfect pitch truly a perfect example there was something truly sick\nThere's a there's a morality of the conscience for those who work kinder to Iran than to Israel or to ... below or it's a ... or to all of them\nVicki Haley has been extraordinary if the United nations Donald Trump has been extraordinary at the United nations\nAfter all the United nations ambassador reflect the will of the president of the United states\nI repeat that the risk of\nWhat is the risk but I think of it the one is the risk getting my sayings that bus far the president of the United states has been a great president\nOh\nWell the risk is that you alienate those who hate the president but I have a model would regard Tibet\nI adopted this when I ... in my first full time job\nAnd I was the director of a Jewish Institute in California that's why I moved from New York to California in my twenties to direct this Institute may have weakened retreats it's gorgeous ... will be thirty two hundred acres\nAnd they had this summer sessions for young people and I would advocate jobs exist in somebody would advocate\nObservance of the laws in the Bible and so on and\nSome members of the board were very afraid\nOf my advocacy of God's existence an observance of the laws of the Bible and so on\nAnd they uh they would say the ... and then not not that was hatred or anything like that are just they would be worried and they would say you know you'll alienate some of the people who come and I developed a great phrase that has guided me you can't alienate the alienated\nThey already were really needed [laughter] that's why they showed up [laughter]\nSo but I you know a friend beg that covers a buddy treated the weekend or whatever so you know I'll alienate people by saying that the president of the United states has been great develops far I don't think that those people have already not been alienated\nI guess that's all it takes is is a favorable word a mere vote for Republican and you're pro rape you understand how ... does become there are no limits to what the left will say that there are no moral limits to what they will do or say\nWho is this person who tweeted out that the ticket you know do something for the good guys and that somebody should take out Brett Kavanaugh\nA teacher there was a teacher with\nA special ed teacher in Minnesota and and\nSo this is what cracks me up a a ... so was this on a Facebook account or it's wheat so Twitter has decided to suspend this person's account suspend\nYou

country\nI I\nDon't read many tweets but I read I read his my wife sure the chosen to me\nIt's an it's an extraordinary thing\nSo anyway ah he has been great it is an astonishing thing I Do worry I admit it or would like to let me can I have the wall Street Journal hear ya I admit it\nI'm just saying I worry\nLess do you think that because I support the president I have a bands and critical fought and I may be wrong by the way I was just telling you I'm worried I'm not telling you I oppose what he's doing\nBut I Am worried U.S China strains deep and and I will there was only one reason one that I Am worried about us China relations in order might be\nI don't think the Chinese would invade Taiwan metal spoke Taiwanese are good because North Korea\nI think that if China says to Kim Jong un don't continue the nuclear as a nation of ... than he won't he's too reliant on China ... China's\nWay of holding us hostage is is North Korea there is no no no other\nSo that's the reason I worry abut that China has abused the world Trade Organization that it is abused intellectual property\nIf I I personally of worry more about China's about Russia\nFor a whole host of reasons I Am and I think the Chinese nationalism is growing at ... ... China I Know a fair amount about China because of my involvement with Chinese people\nAnd a ... ... people don't know how corrupt China is that corruption is a way of life in China\nFrom inside I Know for example people often pay for pay for judges they normally pay the judge they pay to get the judge and then get the verdict that they want\nIt's uh it it it it's\nA truly in many ways I mean not\nAll Chinese I'm Chinese comes the United states for example they become spectacularly successful by a surgeon [laughter] is what is what such example who is considered somewhat of a genius\nAnd by by recent the injury by I which by the way is getting better and better things to the treatment that I have been receiving the chief\nThe person involved in my I work including laser surgery is also the parents are Chinese you don't have to sell me on the capabilities of Chinese people but ...\nIs devoid of values because it of many reasons the biggest the of course being a communism communism rapes a country of its values it empties better than rapes it empties a country of its values\nNothing there's nothing left after communism\nIt leaves a gigantic coal now Christians are filling it somewhat but the persecution of Christians in China has increased all of this is to tell you\nThat it is totally understandable that at some point someone some president interested in America is going to have to confront China better sooner than later\nHowever I worry because of North Korea\nThat's that's the issue\nNorth Korea can or cannot defend the resolve of Kim Jong than to do nothing with regard to denuclearization that is my belief and that is entirely of my concern\nRenee Prager seven seven six who's the number or an digits eight seven seven to for three triple seven six there is no better example a fake news than the cover story in USA Today\nIf it's we\nKnow so I don't know if that's the point that the reason I didn't quite follow\nAll right it would be that as it may well this is the cover story taking up a good chunk of USA Today today\nOne aide Prager seven seven six is the number and let's hear his read in Minneapolis, Minnesota hello\nI'd I I watched the a press conference where president had with Nikki Haley Barbour resigning and I thought it was a very positive uplifting informative yes and almost immediately Senator Bob Menendez a Democrat New Jersey\nA wrote that today's announcement that ambassador Haley is resigning if you had another sign of the Trump administration's chaotic foreign policy and he went on to say deeply concerned about the leadership vacuum that she's leaving\nEver notice that the jury notice read is that the uh the left is always deeply concerned they live in a state of deep concern [laughter] I just that you use that word so what is he he's deeply concerned that what I mean I was talking over you at the end\nI was just wondering if he was watching the same press conferences I oh I see yeah\n[laughter] but I I thought it was a very uplifting of Easter they both look very pleasant happy they have ... I was expecting something maybe a little\nOminous but uh I thought whoa this is a you know she's moving object she's done a great job and she's a big fan of the president wants to continue to stay in touch with them and worked for him around the country she'll support him if he\n... her next reelection would be a her would be secretary of state\nMike Pompeo decides to will leave in the next two years like I Would see McCain Haley I Want you to know thank you ...

differences I think it's um made this humble and that we will probably say she'd braver\n[laughter] I Am braver than I think that this has given us a perspective outside of our country that we could never have gotten the other way to look back at America and in a different way but it's also um for those out there that think they might want to do this spending twenty four hours a day with your spouse or their parents are match [laughter]\nAnd that\nSo that's my question for you perfect segue Robert and I are obviously married we do the show we travel together all the time we've been doing

so much about personal dynamics and just the fact that we are flexible with each other now which they are different than Michael often talked about how we're willing to vote in the same direction I think\nThe Bible is what it really has become instead of celebrating organized labor\nFor most of us including me it means summer's over and if you have a kid especially if you're in the north east school begins\nThe irony is that if you're most of the country school of colleges and glamorous schools they are now going back in the middle of August so Labor Day just as when we shut everything down\nAnd summer isn't over in most any parts of the United states so the first week Monday in September generally speaking\nTrue I mean according to mother nature's summer doesn't end until the equinox on September twenty first\nAnd I'll give you very brief example of that I live in New Jersey and two or three years ago it was over a hundred to ... share\nOn Labor Day and on Tuesday all the lifeguards went home peaches shut down everything closed the governor actually had to order the state beaches reopen and the higher lifeguards so people in the state it get to that age because of the it was a leaf hot because it was so summer\nSo if you were a number of the United states you suggest we move Labor Day to the third Monday of September but one of your main\nArguments Renee is that uh it would be an economic boost really handle that fifty seconds left but you're saying over fourteen day period about thirty nine billion dollars in direct spending on cutting taxes in trickle down benefits would result by extending Labor Day and having people stay on the job\nYou have to lose by trying to move the day or two weeks us travel you took that thirty nine billion dollars it talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs instead of having a holiday that effectively shut down one of the country's largest industries travel\nCan actually keep it moving for another two weeks two or three weeks long weekends people would\nBe happier and country would probably be economically better off there's there's no real downsides of this\nWhen a Mac is president of perception here with an

you know the Caribbean is doing these days is a rebound from a twenty Seventeen hurricane season\n[noise] I think what we have found and in fact I spent a good part of the very late spring traveling among some of the most damage to Ireland from the twenty Seventeen hurricanes and it's hard to believe it's been more than a year but in September of course as we all know\nTwo enormous hurricanes plowed across the Caribbean and then did also significant damage to the mainland United States Irma\nAnd Maria and several of the island groups and islands of the Caribbean\nWere ravaged I'm In ways that we haven't seen in the Caribbean in a very long time and so we really important for us it cost of living to go down we want it to cover the recovery we wanted to inspire our readers who love the beach and of course and loved the Caribbean\nTo go back and spend their money and share their love and help these islands were cover up really great to be there and see that a lot of these beautiful little boutique hotels resorts beach bars are back and they're ready and they can't wait for you all to come down\nWell that's very good news Tracey I Know you were recently in one of the U.S Virgin Islands St John is the one I'm thinking of particular can you let us know what's going on it's a popular island prevent that or is what's going on St John\nJohn has pushed back very quickly um cruise bay for anyone who has been to that beautiful little island of St John\nCruise bay is a is a darling\nLittle port village it's got great shopping it's got ... restaurants and they really made it priority number one on there was quick\nVolunteerism incredible pulling together of locals Kenny Chesney the country star as a as a house there he was rolling up his sleeve helping out\nAnd so crews

people but now it's even more\nKind of warm and loving and heartfelt than ever before\n... not far away from us we're John scores of the British Virgin islands like a you know Peter Island toward tola Cooper Island Scarlett how we didn't get much ... we haven't gotten much news about the ... to be the British Virgin islands what's the situation there\n[noise] the situation in the ... yeah we have to remember that they were hit with a category five storm you know when Irma came through and then Maria followed but Irma set off size ... size monitors\nIn the beauty either intended for earthquakes

living\nStories that we ever as we traveled a full region of the south and we invited these folks to become members of our sibling hotel collection just a few years ago so it's relatively new for us but growing rapidly\nGood to hear so from what I understand you do have sort of a wide mix of properties you've got some new properties as well as uh\nSome of the older more iconic hotels that I Would think are deeply rooted in some good old fashioned southern traditions I'm curious for our listeners who have not travelled her state and the southern region of our country can you just described some of that old world sort of southern hospitality that you look for in these properties\nSure I mean there's other living our bags are always that we love to travel but we like to experience very
