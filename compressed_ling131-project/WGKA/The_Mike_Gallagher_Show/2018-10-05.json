at thirty nine calls thirty nine ... we do not screening or drugs and crazy people they all want him confirmed\nIt it it it's an amazing um outpouring but I also struck by how\nThey're making very good points and and and reason points I mean that that the caller that she was from the New Hampshire us about facts rather than not feelings I'm right they they they they see that but\nThis is why we have this whole process I mean the whole movement the creation of the American constitutional system the establishment of of this thing we call the founding\nThat we're trying to protect here was precisely to set up a process by which we\nDisagree and in front of a month we have great disagreements you still have a process\nA legitimate a fair a just a process so that we come to a reasoned\nA deliberate conclusions and we can govern ourselves we can go forward as a nation this these days that this does come together here I Am I'm I'm really moved by these these calls I'm at the extent that they see they see the core thing going on here this is a is unjust\nBut it's also an attack on the very system\nThat's behind that that is necessary to a whole justice on a day to day basis in a in a free\nCountry and that's I think very powerful this so I don't know how this is close Matt Spalding I really don't because it is so transparent and the stories this morning about witness manipulation et cetera are you an optimist about this and when it's all said and done\nWell I'm an optimist about I'm not necessarily an optimist I mean a lot of messages that our politics for some time there's there's a lot of um\nA aspects of this it needs to be kind of deconstruct it out of the system what I Am an optimist about these calls I think underscore that optimism I've always been an optimist about\nThe American people and their ability to govern themselves when they're engaged in what's when something is before them I mean this goes back to the old notion about the jury system is based on what twelve of your peers\nOrdinary Americans they decide these things why because that's how we we we we do that\nIn the ... the character is formed in a way that they're going to be fair and just uh\nThat's I think the only source we can have optimism ultimately the question is whether the American people engage on this and other questions in ways that restores self government and rebuild that

please I we we got listeners joking that the president said Airforce one bring everybody to Washington you know one of them all up have a big party well listen ... we're we're having a party\nPhilosophically about the jobs numbers in and of course job creators network has been such an integral part of the tax cuts the good news today the ... announced the U.S jobless rate\nDropped a three point seven percent it's if that's the lowest it's been nearly fifty years Elaine such great news you guys have got to be bouncing off the walls with the job that the job creators network has played with the these tax cuts and with this great news about jobs jobs jobs in America\nThat's like a real winters here are the thirty million small business owners that continue to thrive under the economy and the progress but how is that the administration earlier this week I had an op ed on real clear politics\nWhich actually get in on how women are flourishing under the current and ... and we're seeing more women start businesses and re enter the workforce and you asked the guy with a mom you know historically childcare has has acted as a barrier for women and a look the workforce and entrepreneurship\nAnd um and now they're a benefit of that tax\nCuts in jobs that you know not only have we reached east tax rate across the board for everyone\nBut we also doubled the child tax credit and now we're at the direction and that's an absolute reduction off your tax bill right and then for those who are at the lower end of the ... spectrum\nThere is a fourteen hundred dollar refundable tax credits that natural payout for like that and and in many cases that can help offset a lot of your child care costs are worth a huge than it\nIs indeed and and job creators network has been in the in the front line on the front lines of so many of these important issues I Know that you guys have put on your radar Amazon and and they're lobbying for a higher minimum wage and seen some of these protests around the country and of course\nThere's a real simple formula that's happening in ... for example in the service industry\nMcDonald's fast food they're they're being confronted with the demand for a higher minimum wage\nMcDonald's says you know what we're ... that that\nWe're not going to make a profit were business to make a profit so you know we'll do five will replace all of these human beings with kiosks and we're seeing this all across the board where companies have to wisely invested in technology\nAnd and you know robots an automated systems and kiosks because when you're demanding Fifteen Eighteen twenty bucks an hour it doesn't work you lame\nKill a lake and that is true let me start by saying and I think any company that has the right to pay their employees whatever they want and I applaud Amazon for wanting to pay their employees more money\nFrom where I draw the line is pool where they said that they want to um help increase and work

Am by nature are pretty optimistic person\nI Am cautiously optimistic right now however I Want to warn you that don't believe anybody who says they know how this drama this\nNightmare frankly over the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh is going to end we don't know what we do know is that\nBrett Kavanaugh survived a crucial vote moments ago in the Senate and senators Jeff Flake\nSusan Collins and Joe Manchin from West Virginia Democrat cross the aisle and voted with his Republican colleagues as his votes\nPerhaps the big shocker was the Republican from Alaska Lisa Murkowski who voted no in the cloture vote to advance the cabinet nominations the cloture vote past fifty one to forty nine\nNow the clock starts towards this weekend's confirmation if mansion flake and Collins stick with their yes votes and that's not a foregone conclusion it's probable but it is not sure if they do\nThat's the final vote on the confirmation and Brett Kavanaugh will start hearing cases from the bench of the United States Supreme court next week\nUm however both Joe mansion and Susan Collins have suggested that their first vote might not reflect their final vote\nSusan Collins it's being reported is going to confirm how she's voting tomorrow this afternoon at three PM eastern time\nSo ... and then now there's also lots of speculation about Lisa Murkowski possibly voting yes in the end but it doesn't seem like it does not seem particularly likely that she will change your vote from today\nTill tomorrow wow what a day the president has tweeted moments ago he set out a tweet that says and I quote very proud of the U.S Senate for voting yes to advance the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh this is a this was a battle royale\nUm that's a bloodbath and the middle of all this drama\nComes some very fascinating statistics some data if your data driven you're going to you're going to like to hear some of this news first of all the daily presidential tracking poll here just kicked up from Rasmussen you just picked up again\nFor the president right now the Rasmussen Reports daily presidential tracking poll for friday today shows the fifty one percent\nOf likely us voters approve\nOf President Trump's job performance forty eight percent disapprove\nLast check this for me but I think this was the highest it's been an Rasmussen says the president took office um it's you know you can say that the majority now for the first time perhaps of likely us voters approve of the job the President Trump is doing\nWhat's remarkable ... what's remarkable about that is to consider how much has been thrown at him for two years the entire\nEnormous machine where Republicans in the swamp the media\nBut Democrats activists Hollywood\nNew York I mean they have tried desperately to slow this guy down\nAnd to stop him but you know what's not you know you you know what's hard for them to swallow\nIt won't work and there's a credible economic news that was revealed revealed the day this is extraordinary news of ... and all kinds of good news optimism among us manufacturers continues to shore\nAccording to the national association of manufacturers nearly Ninety three percent of manufacturers are projecting further expansion for their businesses\nPositive sentiment among small companies is up to Ninety One point three percent unemployment is at the lowest was announced this morning and the unemployment rate is down to three point seven percent\nYou know the last time America's unemployment rate was a three point seven percent Nineteen sixty nine and of course you hear

Brett Stevens from the New York times he is a fears never Trump\nHe's the kind of conservative the New York times approves of he wrote a piece yesterday but frankly is is is sure to get\nHim fired I I mean I'm I'm not saying that to be gloom and doom for him I I don't want to hear anybody getting fired but nonetheless rent Stevens who has written column after column\nIf Mr rating President Trump writes yesterday for once I'm grateful for him he says for the first time since Trump entered the political fray I find myself grateful but he's in it I'm reluctant to admitted he wrote I'm astonished to say it\nI'm grateful because Trump hasn't backed down in the face of the slippery miss hypocrisy and dangerous standards setting\nDeployed by opponents of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court I'm grateful he writes because ferocious and even crash opposite of sees has its uses in life\nAnd never more so than in the face of slide moral bullied I'm grateful because he's a big fat\nHammer fending off a razor sharp dagger\nWow that's big news that's big news last ... last night the president had I'm a big rally in Minneapolis in fact I've already got colors waiting to talk
