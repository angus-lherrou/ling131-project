{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "Where we just discuss the first step which is a setting the GPS is basically yeah eating just set out and really find out everything we can about what you're looking for retirement the next step appetizers right take out yeah we take all that information well actually no there's a step before that\nAnd it's called dangers in detours and this is is we come back with the numbers and on and and how much they have and how much they've saved and how much they need and retirement\nAnd we'd crunch show me we first of all the big question is what do they do have enough money to last a lifetime right and so that's the first thing we want to tell them and and so we look at that number and and if there's not enough how can be improved what are some things we can do to\nTo save more or make more get a better return on our money are fine but if vehicles for our money but also we want to look at what can go wrong because if we're planning a trip or or you know\nA picking a road trip or whatever that things go wrong so we also want to look at what could go wrong and so we start looking at numbers if something went wrong and so what are some things that can go wrong well number one we could have a a stock market crash again we could have\nA tax increase that would certainly affect your retirement inflation could increase or we could lose a spouse at which which certainly in almost all cases affect your retirement because of the loss of income at least the Social Security payment would stop\n'em you know there's a all you know many many of those some of them would be taking care of a of an aging parent or maybe having a child moved back in um you know so so what we want to do is we want to run those scenarios and see how to fix it\nAnd then we know not only what do we need to do to make it through retirement but what do we need to do to make it through retirement and life is just in the in the face so to speak so that's the second meeting discovery or or dangerous and teachers I mean is the second meeting and it's kind of a way of presenting to the to the prospect her client\nThis is what the numbers tell us maybe you need some help or maybe you don't need some help and and so that's meeting number two and it's really probably probably the critical meeting\nRight as that is a critical juncture right there\nAnd you know getting that GPS said is one thing but then looking out for a road blocks and detours and figuring out those and having a plan in place when those come up a light market volatility or you know rising healthcare costs things like that right is that what you're talking\nAbout absolutely absolutely so and what it does a Tony a kind of helps us I'm kind of transition to the next step and that is planning the trip\nAnd so that's where we basically take all of these good things bad things dangers are opportunities all of this and we begin developing your plan and what's important to know is is I don't sit here at my desk and ... and go back and present it to them\nWe spend the first one or two planning meetings educating the client\nThis is this is some of the tools is is how money works this is uh how you need to start thinking about re allocating some things and then with their help and with educating them we began developing that retirement road map and we always start with income I mean if you don't have the income for a lifetime\nThat you might as well forget everything else it doesn't matter what else happens that you're going to run out of money so we start with an income plan\nAnd I've never ever Tony had somebody walk into my office where they written income plan they may have some projections some illustrations but this is a plan\nYear by year where your money's coming from a what's the effect of inflation what's the effect of taxes and and make your shirt last a lifetime and so that's one of the planning process\nAnd so planning a trip really last a usually about three to four meetings so its education and then is a a presentation in kind of coming to terms own um you know buying into with his work with that word you like this you like that\nAnd then beginning the process of of a fulfilling that plan if we need to move so many around will start doing that opening new accounts maybe keeping some of their accounts if they'll work well with the plan\nWe have in writing every step of the way and every scenario in strategy for anything that could go wrong so that we have a really the number one thing Tony as peace of mind we know no matter what happens we have a strategy or an alternative for that particular um a tragedy or or offset the may have happened\nYeah yeah and I say I see I see your point there and and we really need to be prepared for that and we don't want to be in a bad situation or leave our loved ones in a bad situation uh so what's the next step on this path\nWhen when you tell a quick story here as we're as we finish up old dude I Love your stories yeah yeah and this is a true story and then by the way this happens probably twice a year\nBut this one hit me especially because this was a uh some clients that I've been working with three or four years and had grown very fond of we'd we'd gotten to be friends and and had gone out to dinner with them and things like that and so uh one morning I got a call from from her and I'll I'll I'll make up a nameless color Jane\nAnd Jane gives me a call and says I'm a mark I wanted you to know that gym which is her husband passed away last night\nShe said what do I do and and you know my first thing I said was you don't worry because we have a plan for this in his novel we wanted to happen it is a but but we we anticipated something could happen\nAnd so you go and you go plan funeral you'd go be with family and friends you go love on your family you let them level when you you grieve\nAnd and you know when you're ready it could be three weeks could be a couple of months I'm going to make a couple of adjustments to make sure the income flows not interrupted and then we'll meet and we'll pull the trigger on a couple of things that we already planned that we might have to do\nAnd you'll be fine in the peace of mind the burden that was lifted financially from her allowed her to mourn and go to the process of that\nAnd you know that's that's not what we want to happen no different than the client the ... coming in for years and and you notice that the husbands beginning to become confused\nAnd and you know you know what's happening you know and then in somewhere down the road the wife you know does devotion to you that yes we you know he's been diagnosed with Alzheimer's when again we've got a plan we we've got something in place uh that that we can switch to that we can alter the map we can alter the road trip\nDoes a detour there so we need to take another road and we do that and we're prepared for that and\nTony I tell you what you know folks that are doing this or just maybe have a broker or maybe manage their own money and they turn on their Social Security and and they start taking money out of a bank account and and that's it\nUm [noise] I just don't know how to sleep at night I really don't I mean that's like waking up every morning checking the stock market and make sure you're not down too far so you'll have money for that month\nI I don't I don't know how and why you would do that\nUm it would also be I think to me it's almost like never going to a doctor just saying you know I'll I'll Google some things if I get a headache or if I lose my appetite and and I'll be All right you know type of thing well nobody would do that but yet financially\nPeople do it all the time and so this gets back to our fork in the road\nWhich one do you want to take I'm going to do this myself and Google some things and and her broker and and what kind of saving some fees and ... you know things like this or am I going to make sure that I have the best retirement I can have financially and get some help some professional help and take that for\nWhat I mean I think the answer simple but unfortunately for a lot of folks if not\nWell and it can be overwhelming I mean you know you have to admit mark hearing you talk about this and the radio and bring up some of these concepts a lot of people are like wow I'm not\nA I'm not Mr Mrs finance I'm not into all this and I I don't I'm not super wealthy so this doesn't\nYou know or we can get in the weeds on it and I'm just gonna go along doing my thing but really it is so important and you don't have to do it alone because obviously mark you're willing to help your even willing to give an hour complimentary insult consultation to\nTo help people get started so I think it's really important that people understand this and a nose at uh it doesn't have to be complicated they might make it more complicated than it has to be\nAnd it really is important not you know for people with a small amount of money in a lot of money it's just as important isn't it\nIt really is because those with a lot of money\nTypically spend a lot of money and so they want to maintain their lifestyles and so you know really it it it all becomes relative uh\nAnd so I've got people that that work with us and have a million dollars and and they were afraid to go to run out of money because they have a lot of needs to have a lot of things they want to do\nA and they got people that come in with two hundred thousand dollars in and of course they're concerned and and should be a and so you know both both is the spectrum or or require planning and and what you've worked hard for you don't want to see vaporized because of some bad decisions are bad economic or or whatever it may be\nYou want to make sure that that just as good a job as you did saving you want to do a great job or when it comes to to pay to making it the retirement\nAll right well that sounds great now we're at a time for today's show mark is there anything else you want to add before we have to go today\nWhere we get those five slots available for the complementary consultations or one of the first five that all of the first five that contact us we'll get those slots and um\nYou know hopefully this this uh this program is really a maybe touched a nerve with with some of you that you know now's the time and whether you're retiring next week next month next year I prefer to get started on formulating the plan between five and ten years ahead of time\nBut don't think that you should retire next week are you retired last year that it's too late it's not too late\nI Know a lot of the audience but I don't know many people in this audience at the audience feels they know me 'cause they listen to me talk about multiple issues that's a that's an anomaly that's an aside but if you're hiring someone in a different state that doesn't have a radio show in a bunch of audio and video content you can't know without interviewing a few different people\nAnd listening to opinions\nWhat what I Know is that when someone has talked to multiple agents and then they talk to me they immediately don't want to get off the phone\nOne on one of the first agents they've talked to they want to move on and talk to other agents but then they get caught up in the sales ether that is our business I don't believe I'm In sales not with the people that higher is I Believe where it consultancy an\nAdvocacy because the world has changed I made a phone call\nOr two mark done who is going to be on the show here in a bit talking about health insurance the other mortgage in your life new era health plans are plan rocks dot com I called them to do the interview\nAnd we record the interviews usually so I I call them to do the interview and he didn't answer or I didn't call the right number but it was one of his sales numbers and I got the voice mail and I hung up and I I was about to call the other number my phone rang and I thought well this could be him it's not the same number let me just try 'cause it was almost immediate\nAnd it was a return phone call\nAnd it was a automated message which was talking about open enrollment in health\nI was stunned I've had this happen in real estate I had a former high school classmate from high school\nOr on Facebook message me one day and say I need to sell a house in ... Georgia can you help me with absolutely be glad to help you sell a house within minutes he was getting notifications from other real estate agents interested in helping him sell as home\nWe're being spied on and we're being manipulated\nAnd I'm not saying that some of our marketing doesn't take the tone of that sort of stuff but I don't know how it works I just subscribed to people and vendors who help us produce real buyers and sellers of things in real estate but\nThe point of it is it's it's creepy that something on my phone spied on me and recognized I just call the number that sells health insurance\nThat's what it was and most people\nFall for it because that's in their head right then they're answering the phone and they fall for it because it's the right moment at the right time and they never stopped to think is this a greedy egregious sailed operation or agent or whatever or is it ... or is it legitimate\nAnd most of the time it's illegitimate because people just want to get it over with as many of you know that listen\nTo the on the radio I spent the better part of the last three years doing mostly media with a a a sidebar real estate\nUm I won't go through the whole story but some things happen in the media business this year because basically it's full of a bunch of idiots and fake news are liars and I decided to not participate in that any more because you can't make money when you have to lie to climb the ladder and to work with some bags\nNow in real estate you have to work with a lot of scum bags but you don't have to lie to make a lot of money\nYou simply don't have a lot you can tell the truth and you'll lose some deals but you'll gain as many are far more by telling the truth and you'll make a lot more money\nSo if I really want to make a difference the best thing I can do is help people buy and sell real estate and accomplished your financial goals so I decided to get out of the media business as a fulltime job\nAnd instead of just walking back into real estate business like every arrogant person in my business does I said you know when they assume I don't know anything and I'm starting from scratch again I've got Twenty years nearly experiences business I'd said let me figure out\nWhat really needs to happen to have\nThe kind of success in this phase of my career I call it faced three\n[noise] and I started interviewing people for a month I didn't do anything to make any money I didn't do anything that was the sales activities and making money I'm fortunate enough I didn't have to do that but I I basically sat down and I took sales pitches from anybody willing to give me a sales pitch or a demo of their product\nIn the process of doing that in thirty days I got an education that would have taken me two or three years to obtain I didn't rush through it I didn't have a gun to my head financially and I wasn't trying to prove or do anything quickly\nAnd when I got done with it I made some decisions about various technology vendors to re launch our company and what I Would call circuit twenty twenty or twenty Twenty one meaning it too well ahead of his time our technology is beyond what most Ninety nine point nine percent of agents are companies in Atlanta half\nI'm convinced of it because I spent so much time focused on it made a couple of bad decisions I quickly annihilated those bad decisions by firing those companies terminating those contracts due to breach or non performance and moved on to companies that are exceptional\nWe're seeing showings on listings of the life I've never seen before we're getting leads off of listings were selling our own list things while if things aren't selling reproducing double and triple in some cases the showing that other agents prior to us it produced where they had expired and I attribute it to some of our Web vendor decisions\nAnd the reason I'm able to produce that and proudly say that with truth being the backbone of it is the fact that I stopped and listened to all of a sales people fail cell and I probably listen to a hundred different pitches throughout the course of April of this year to make a decision on eight or ten vendors\nI'm that's what home sellers don't do they don't listen they\nJust want to get it on the market and get it sold they want a four or five percent commission they're not interested in paying the most and they want to negotiate terms that allow it to they we assume and the services world that we're going to be lied to and that the minute we realize we've been lied to I Want to be able to fire this person and move on\nThere is nothing wrong with that safety net you're creating for yourself here's the problem\nTop people like me will not take a thirty day lifting\nWe will not negotiate our commission\nBecause we know we're going to produce for that point you may say with you know that I call 'em real estate hors I don't have a better word for the real estate horrors that are out there will cut their commission will cut their market time\nWe'll cut through whatever it is that they do is part of the integrity of their system that they really know that they should be doing\nAnd if they will do that in the context of negotiating with you for the sake of doing anything to get you to lift your home with them\nThey will cut your equity that fast or faster if they will fight for their own rights their own contractual terms in their own commission right they sure as hell aren't going to fight for what you want to the top dollar of your home they're going to step you in the first deal the first contract\nAnd they may not even tell you about the other two deals that are coming because they don't want to risk waiting on those they\nDon't want to advise you through to make the best decisions they want to advise you through to get a quick commission and move on\nThat is the problem that is created by the crookedness of the industry of housing and by the desire of people in housing to get a better rate because they don't see value to get lesser terms because they don't want to get stuck with the wrong age you the best agents don't negotiate much\nAnd by that nature they won't negotiate against you their client either that is one of the first things you look at I told the seller I said you got to not always liked the agent you're talking to 'cause they're kind of rough and snappy and tough\nYou need that to win and the housing business he needed ... fight for their own rights these are the things I look for when I talk to people\nIn the service business not that I like them or they give me everything I Want but they have a way of standing up for what they want and explaining it to me that's the way to make the best decisions we'll be right back and just

people focus on whether it's getting a mortgage getting a house the first question the last real estate agents what's your commission on that's too high\nWell what's your uh what's your rate on the mortgage oh that's too high but they don't get into one of the fees that we don't know about that Dr the annual percentage rate up and in your case you know what the rate of return or what the annual investment the and they focus on them a new show most of America unfortunately focuses on them a new show\nBecause that's what they can immediately measure but they don't focus on the results and the

estate if you need some assistance in what seems to be slowing real estate market in metro Atlanta\nThen please go to our website the real estate experts dot com and reach out to us through there you you can also try our home valuation um on line is there's no obligation even if you're thinking about selling you don't have to\nDo anything with us I'm a if you want to go get a quick instead valuation kind of see what the market is relevant to your home that's house hunting online dot com I give out two websites because that'll take you straight to the home value in there and I do want to warn you were getting some people\nWho really scare me not ... not so much from the radio but people who find it digitally an Facebook where we've we've done some marketing of our home valuation tool\nWell I don't think I Would want to do any business would you because you obviously don't know the market considering what value you gave us here on this condo in midtown\nRight and I I was stunned actually told the guy this week as you know what to be honest I don't want to do business with you I I have no interest in taking you're listening so don't assume that this was prospecting I'm not that kind of agent there are plenty of real estate horse out there and that's what I call them I'm Sorry that happened you but there are people who are willing to do anything to get a listing\nI have never had a hard time getting a listing and and so therefore I I don't know sometimes you don't get that you want but because you get beat out or somebody has better sales pitch where they live better I don't know what it is but\nI'm at the end result is is an agent he'll do anything to get a listening is an age and doesn't know how to sell one because you know when you'll do anything to get a listing and you'll try to convince someone at all costs to live with you\nUm that you're setting expectations way too high and the likelihood is that you're not going to sell it but the reason agents will do anything to get a list thing is because they don't really care whether they sell your house or not he had to keep this in mind when you go to lose the house while real estate agents don't care if they sell your house or not now they do want to sell it because everybody wants a commission\nBut if they don't sell it there's a safety net for them and you need to know this this is what you look for in the rye listening engine\nIf the agent will do anything to get a listing at the age and doesn't have that many listings and the reason they want you are listening is they want the buyers that they can get off of you are listening which means the moment the phone rings or whatever happens that someone had done it by themselves as having an interest in your home property condo et cetera\nThis agent is going to immediately as they've been trained by the millions of real estate to convert to buyer prospecting\nWhich means they're going to want to develop a relationship with that fire\nAnd as they develop a relationship with that by or\nThey have to turn off the sales ether of trying to sell your home that means automatically they are missed serving their flu Sherry duty to you they're not interested in selling your home anymore they're interested in making sure they get a buyer that will buy a home to them and they'll give them that they sell your house or not because at that point they've made their three percent\nAnd whether you're how cells are not as irrelevant I'm telling you that's how this business work that's a it's not overstated it's not as much conscious as I'm making it sound but it is in fact\nThe way it works I I like to pride myself and saying I'm not a really great buyers age and I have great buyers agents on my team so when my phone rings and somebody wants to see one of our listings or by one of our listings are interested in one of our list in my my I I kind of turn into a used car lot\nWhich is when somebody comes on that used car lot what happens this is not how I treat my buyers this is not how I treat my sellers which are mostly my clients sellers\nI treat you as an advocate consultant I that's what my role is when when it comes to a buyer calling on a sign or marketing peaceful one of our listings\nI'm used car lot I got a certain number of cars on that lot and I got to sell them one of the more I don't tell them anything is kind of the mentality I use because you've hired me to sell your home\nNot to go and use your home to attract other buyers to become our clients we don't need to do that there's there's all this called Google Edwards works rate for that I Do need listings anymore in order to attract and find dozens of buyers that are going to buy something in the next year or two I don't need a listing for that\nMost real estate agents don't know how to use the technology that's available in our space so they need listening to get the calls it's very very\nCheap it's very incompetent that's wire industry has such a low represent ... your reputation so when someone calls on the list and you need an agent is fixated on selling that listing that's what makes a great listing agent they're an advocate for their client their their seller\nAnd they're a salesman to the people calling on the list thing which means I Need to sell this listening to that person and I need to be willing to lose that potential relationship with the buyer in order to do the best job possible Elvis lifting that's why when you're a buyer it makes sense not to call sellers listening agents because you may get one like me I just wanted to tell you that house\nAll right now that sounds that sounds shady no it's not if you were hired to sell a home we got to sell the house we don't need to be worried about taking the listing in order to get other buyers which I can go and buy from Google and Facebook\nThat's the way the business works if it's being done correctly that's a business that has integrity that serves the interests of the people who sign\nClient arrangements with you that's how it works that's not how Ninety five percent or more of the industry operates Ninety five percent or more this industry does not know how to run a business so they never act like it is a business and that's the problem that people have with our industry\nTell you I got laid off on track but I think that was very helpful and how you select an agent\nSo health hunting online dot com is a home value waiter and that is not a take it to the bank number it's a no obligation instant quote you don't have to talk to us you don't have to work with is we like it if you just tell us your not selling that's fine and we won't keep bugging you\nBut if if um if you go there it's gonna give you a general idea if you're going to sell you need someone like me my wife one of the members are team or an equivalent agent of confidence to tell you the value is in today's market no on line automated system can do that the problem and housing today if it's become brain what's in an accountable\nYou know we everybody goes to ... them and they go in our auto value waiter and they say they take all these and they all kind of come in the same values some are more accurate than others ours tends to be more accurate in some segments of the market condos are a little tougher for our auto value waiter and what ends up happening so in Brazil and I've seen while numbers on their\nPeople tend to let that shape their impression of the market all this on line crap is wrong\nIt's for it's predominantly wrong the reason that the real estate industry and real estate agents as\nBad as some of those are in this industry most of most of the agents in this industry are the reason it has not gone by the way of the travel agency and the travel agents in the travel industry\nIs because it's not like airplane flights every home and property is unique and you need someone who has accurate intelligence and experience to unpack all those unique Mrs and converted to price in marketing that's the only reason we're still here\nAnd the vast majority of people that are struggling or not maximizing their equity are doing so or not doing so because they hired someone didn't have a clue what they're doing\nThis also translates the homeowners' associations I got a letter I Want to read part of it from El he's a listener who's a listen for a while um they've got a home and Milton Alpharetta um they've got some problems they had a twenty five hundred dollar fine on their property back in July twenty five dollar a day fine\nAnd they live down in Florida primarily\n'em and they didn't get the mail they said that that's common I was sitting in a board meeting at my my primary residence this past week and it's ... well we got to do is mail it and I said to somebody I said we we all certified mail it we ought to take the onus on us as a as a\nAs a homeowners' association to make sure that when we send out correspondence of legal nature that has a timeline on it or find attached to it\nThat we send it certified to say we sent it to you somebody signed for it you didn't get it not my problem but they just shoot him a letter in the mail they slop ally send it to some address it doesn't exist I've had this happen over and over and over again I'm In a battle with\nWith a second home neighborhood now because they just send out a letter to some bogus addressed that they pulled out of their rear end without looking at the legal address to the property\nAnd this happens all the times I Believe these people in writing to me they said you know we've been trying to get this removed from the prior property manager there's been a change in management now they they won't do it first question is who gets the delinquent find revenue this is male the listener here management company or the joy let's stop on that one\nGenerally speaking in many cases and property management\nFines and fees go to a combination of\nThe homeowner's association which are part of and the management company so there is an incentive to be a terrible management company and they find happy and treating neighborhood or a community of condos like a high school hall monitor\nBecause there's revenue to be obtained from harassing the residents so that's the first problem in nature way it should be illegal in the state of Georgia or anywhere in the country for an ACOA management company to get even scent of a fine levied on residents for noncompliance with anything late fees anything I don't care if it's extra work I used to believe\nEmails though it is is Chanel soup of those ... ... ... ... you know you got to stay a gym which is ... my ... my favorite Paul and Canada yet to be back yeah\nNo doubt and we've got another you've probably heard the voice ... already here we've got that Justin on today Justin water don't want it I didn't like your last name huh why\nJustin Wagner is the worst time W. A. G. [laughter] [laughter] so I have not introduced you before and you have a designation\nWill I Do I just got one you know when I came to term I didn't have any and everyone has one\nAnd so I had to get something you know I I thought I noticed some ah some this guy has he credited investment fiduciary wow produced ... accredited and fiduciary all want a title oh\nIt is and how you were so much as we like it would way you're going to have five pounds [laughter] welcome it should be or was it was\nA Jared actually works in our planning an implementation department the a is a financial planner and Justin works in our four one K. division talks to a whole lot of four one K. planned participants\nAh talks trustees and anybody pretty much it would be attached to a four one K. I'm given great advice and helping folks\nAh allocate their four one K. I'm ... ... in the hopes of retiring well mhm yeah that's the plan exactly so uh guys we've got to ask him the five hundred over the last five days is actually up felt\nVery volatile now that as of the recording on Thursday we know what the market is a\nAs um sold off a bit lately and part of it did come on Thursday when are\nWe heard from the federal open market committee which is a part of the Federal Reserve or the folks that set the overnight lending rate and uh basically what they had to say was they expect to continue raising interest rates now\nI'm In an effort to control inflation run yeah here's here's my take on that and and you're absolutely right you're I mean that's why they do it the feds got\nKind of dual mandate or used to be that only paid attention to as inflation making sure that inflation didn't get out of control they want it to be positive they just wanted to be slightly positive rather have a target of two percent and um right now inflation is a to point three percent\nThat's down from the previous month where it was to point seven percent\nAnd that previous Martha's down from the even more previous month two point nine percent so inflation seems like it's been ... ... uh there's a lot of folks including our president who have come out and said uh\nUh he got it might be a good ... yeah it might be a good time to to\nUh think about taking a breath instead of staying on your um your bandwagon to lower or higher interest rates and lower inflation I'm at the risk we run is that uh we invert the yield curve and stifle\nNot only inflation but economic growth ... um you know over the last few months we've seen a\nA GDP Growth rage four point one percent and the last two quarters a pretty significant much of that and I've talked about it before on the show I I Believe is due to um\nTax reform ah you know we had twenty five percent earnings growth and that's measured year over year so and the second quarter was relative to the second quarter of two thousand Seventeen third quarter the same thing it's relative to two thousand seventeenth third quarter I'm and we're expected in the third quarter to do\nA ... yeah and we're expecting the third quarter to see now I mean first and second or third quarter is expected to be twenty five percent growth again so I'm you know we've got good growth uh we've got inflation paring back um\nYou see the volatility have has crept in because of the Fed's discussion\nRemark it certainly doesn't look ... I've been getting a lot of questions from clients this past week about the not tell them\nDo what you just said you know there's still a lot of help coming out of of\nThe economy and the markets in general and so the the same information that we had when we made the buying decisions to invest in the companies that we did is largely what is still the case today so just because interest rates are beginning to creep up which again the the the food is doing in that effort to control inflation was\nProbably a maybe a small amount of regard but not much to what the market thinks about it right because I guarantee you the market will like the inflation numbers ...\n... a lot more actually is a they were can continue just to keep rates were there were so\nMy point is there's still a lot of good things coming out of the market and and the fact that interest rates are going up does that make mortgages more expensive and potentially you know prevent people from getting into homeland war yeah maybe but there's also this other side of the things we're you know what money market or interest rates are coming back of your short or a little bit more on your money that\nYou know has not been available for years Gail Lewis recruits were so great benefit\nTo savers yeah it's not all bad yeah I think that's probably the biggest part when we've almost lost a whole generation of retirees when they were used to much higher rates rise Twenty years ago and very true yeah we're happy just to get three or four and now we can start to get some high returns on that yeah the historical perspective\nAbsolutely just and that's a that's exactly what we're we're looking at right now so I'm you know it's a\nA not a horrible thing or as you said a dirt the or the the problem is we got an increase in the costs of capital because we have a rise in the in the interest rates um the other thing is\nUm we don't know when the rates might slow down and there's something else going on we really don't talk about much don't hear much in the media at all and that's a quantitative tightening\nHave you guys heard anything about quantitative dining so we had qualitative\nDecay has been an easing yeah we had quantitative easing for a long time well ... in doing that we had the the feds balance she'd get up to four points four trillion dollars in two thousand eight when we started this program um the ... she was about five hundred billion\nCorrupt so uh last October or the fed came out and said hey look here's what we're gonna do guys we're going to try to retool so we've got something to do it if and when I was you know the business cycle is definitely not dead ... uh it's it's been elongated for sure\nOver our last cycle you know having a having bottom that a\nA march of two thousand nine\nUh we've been in this this uh positive bumped swinging the economy let alone the stock market for for ... you know what do we got nine years now the the longest bull market in history as of about a month ago\nUm so when you've got a the feds balance sheet where we had ... so many treasuries\nAnd a mortgage backed securities\nThat bloated the way it was we would be crazy to try to do any quantitative easing if we had another measure issue where we needed that interest rate cut that\nAh couldn't be done with just the overnight lending rate which is kind of the building block of the rest of interest rates in the in the market so um\n[noise] what we had as it started out at ten billion dollars they're allowing these uh trade reason and mortgage backed securities to mature overtime mhm uh and it's been a monthly thing they have it a step that will it caps at fifty billion dollars\nWhen it kept this month so a year and we're now letting fifty billion dollars worth of treasury roll off\nNot treasuries and mortgage backed securities probably more mortgage backs but you know I wasn't relatively close mix\n'em but ah we're letting them roll off just mature which is ... ... an absolutely that is quantitative tightening when you have a big bar or like the United states government in the market purchasing bonds what happens is the price goes up and we know the bonds have\nAn inverse relationship between their yield and their price [laughter] so uh in in looking at that we've got two things working the only one we're talking about the ... the\nUh the actual rate setting body a but in reality uh we got quantitative type thing going on behind the scenes it's part of the reason that we're seeing longer term interest rates increase um\nI look at whether or not you understand the concept of quantitative easing or tightening up at the bottom line is that that's the responsibility of the federal open market yeah the ... and they do that to control inflation I think it's still a more positive thing to be where we are now than what we were discussing the last time ozone with Detroit and that is\nThe track record of what happens in this country when the yield curve doesn't hurt and if they don't make some of these decisions like they're making with regard to ensure storage we could very well see that and that's that was one\nThe percent of the time when the yield curve and version happens\nIn a recession ensues no shortly thereafter where there were a teenager on Shia probably on the long run yeah look I mean you might not you might not like the ritual whatever your reason would be but at the end of the day they're doing it in an effort to control inflation\nWhich affects the yield curve and we know what that equates to so this is important stuff that they need to be doing and while the market may not like it just know that it's it's appropriate for where we are\nNo tax yeah if you do the math precisely actually it's it's all about the tax write so if you assume that you're paying more taxes now than you will in retirement\nThen you're better off to forgo the taxes today saving budget overtime All right and and you know you'll get money at\nIt there in your retirement or whenever you start drawing draw at a lower tax rate but it truly is just about the tax rate if you just do the the role math\nAnd so um there's nobody that can tell the future of course um we always assume the taxes are too high now and they might get worse button hay in the fifties and sixties taxes were ... well I just saw what's happened here with our current administration acts as of now gone down so we don't know where they're\nGoing to go but I think at the end of the day I think you know a company's match is always going to come pre tax was up you know you're going to be getting pre tax money you know it's always smart to have some type of Ross contribution within the ... that way you get boats have both of those buckets like we like to\nGo right about the different because so many people realize that you know if you if you have the option to put fifty percent of your contribution to your four one K. and the traditional portion and the other fifty and you're all portion and then you know in the case of of Matthew and marry him you know if they're if they're getting so this five percent match\nThat entire five percent of the employers giving them goes to the traditional portion of the match does not get a plot or allocated to the Roth portion at all which not a huge deal but I think the bottom line is you need a balance between the tax diversification over here ... just as much as you might need diversification on your investments\nUm it'll give you some control in retirement that while that might not matter as much to you now I can assure you that once you reach that age and and you are basically being forced into a certain tax situation here\nThat is going to be a lot more meaningful to you at that time so I'm sure you know well what\nIf we take it one step further should should you also saving a brokerage account or a taxable account [noise] I think you\nShould I think it's important 'cause right now we're talking about really the three main types of money ride you got the tax exempt money which is wrong with the tax deferred money which is four one K.\nThan traditional are raising et cetera but then you got the the after tax money which is just a brokerage and then the case of of that and you only pay tax on the games you make with the investments within it and\nAnd and then only when you realized themselves run gains until you sell that you really don't have to pay the tax\nExactly but I I think it's good to to have as much option as you can and while you might forego some of that tax benefit in the in the near term as you were saying if you still have you know especially for younger folks look like you mentioned justice minister you've got plenty of time to make back\nThe the the taxes that you were for going by by having the money tax and then putting it into a Roth for instance and letting that want to grow tax exempt because it's not there's no tax application on it if you hold it until retirement me on fifty nine and a half either so\nYou know what you got plenty of time to to hit that break even on what it would otherwise be if you didn't forego the tax and just put it into an attached to for money to\nI'm just finding was caused this is not something I've written a book or anything like that is just the atmosphere and we work with now right exactly they are expressing some regret for not having a little bit of option and and flexibility now that they've reached that retirement age and\nAnd it's a tool the tax bill account as a tool that you can use to offset some of the other ... you have if you have losses within that account or you can you can go ahead and in a sell some of those ... realize those losses and lower your ... your tax burden in any given year Russia [noise]\nAll right well let's take a real quick braking we come back\nAnd answer the question is are are in Iraq [laughter]\n\nAt him for Norton insurance we recognized the

E. N. S. S. L. E. R.\nSo guys I'm as I was saying when we last spoke we were talking about a four O. one case a couple of who's save 'em at least what we consider the minimum where you're getting the match from your company five percent sure hum but they've saved at all to traditional so it was a pre tax\nUh our advice is spread it around not only use the the pre tax but if there is a Roth option or be a good idea for you to save some money to the raw gives you a a diversification in the vehicle through which you save for retirement as well as a brokerage account which gives you the added\nBenefit while the the money goes in after tax so you're going to get the tax it from your income\nOr you put the money into a brokerage account or but it also that then allows you to come to manage your tax situation or in retirement which if you've only saved to a regular four one K. you don't have that option will\nWell and and look here's why this is extremely important enough seeing this a couple of times lately which once again I would've never thought of\nBeforehand but you know if if you go into retirement and all you have is taxed for money that's you know let's just say one four one K. account but you say to all your life\nAnd then you come across let's say a piece of property or a boat or just some big purchase that you want to make it look so you're you're against you know financing the purchase\nOr at least would prefer not to to finance it will if you want to pay cash for let's just say something that cost fifty thousand dollars medical I won't do this for a small cabin up in the mountains recently\nBut everything you know the money that he was going to need to to take out of his accounts to pay for it was all in the tax tougher to count he's got a twenty percent of federal withholding on that money so the fifty thousand in order to buy the property he had to take out sixty thousand to cover that twenty percent withholding right now it's effectively cost you more recalls\nReady to hear that answer the obvious waiting so much will either leave incorrect no and I know that's the way we're going to go is because you know\nThe answer nothing is buying hold forever you know I mean look you're right those are pretty solid companies but nowhere in the world would all be comfortable just buying something knowing I'm never going to sell it particularly and then after ...\nYears ago I bet you that would be people who disagreed with you without a doubt wanting to G A I was just that one had another product sample yeah yep yeah things change people change management dangerous I mean there there are reasons that you\nCannot assume that you're going to hold anything forever but let me flesh out a little bit of what's going on here next their energy symbol N. E.\nAh it's got a five year earnings growth uh almost twelve percent expected to grow by about eight and a half percent going forward\nUm the company is a a a utility it's an interesting take on the utility it's a they generate electricity through wind solar nuclear and natural fire fired gas facility so uh they've got some renewable energy and then they've got\nUm you know nuclear and and um gas fired um\nGenerators or the company really does seem pretty solid return on equity at eleven percent uh it's got us reasonable devotee into point seven percent you'll well covered one point seven times\nUh you know not to not growing like a tech stock these days but uh still a pretty solid option does meet our investment criteria and based on financial strengthen safety I'm not a bad option a McCormick and company\nAh got expecting growth eight point eight percent so a little bit better the next there\nUh although it's a expectations actually match its history where next stairs is a little lower than what has been recently I'm\nTwenty three percent return on equity a little more substantial now this company McCormick if you've ever been down to spy style at the grocery store you know who we're talking about oh yeah ... are so good stuff tends to be a staple you're going to buy a spices probably I Can't imagine that you're going to\nLay off the stage just because a recession his foes actually are going to eat what they eat on no matter what so energy and staples both probably pretty solid options for for a downturn does make them a little more\nAre likely to be those companies that you could potentially hold for long periods of time\nUh they're they're both very profitable both uh meet our investment criteria they yield is one point six four percent all McCormick so it's a bit of a lower or David in it's better covered because they're not paying out as much of their\nEarnings to point three times\nA yield coverage or giving coverage so\nI'm either one of these are pretty ... pretty decent options I don't really recommend them at the moment I'm you know just because it's there there are other options in the market but I Would prefer but ah I I tend to agree with you Jared I Would be really\nPressed to call something to buying hold for an ethics mhm hopefully the joke that broke her maid was just that I'm a joke [laughter] um\nBut as a result we have you guys here in in research department I mean we really you don't even want to buy and hold you want to bind and do your homework like a a pretty popular guy on CNBC always says right I mean you don't you don't just buy and then forget about it you got to keep an eye on it that analysis as to continue to make sure that as things change it is to\nHold her as long as it makes sense yeah there is surely know buying forget right exact out\nAll right so a got a few more questions here one of those when I was trying to jump the gun on a Albert from Gainesville my four one K. offers in plan Ross conversions is something I should consider I'm fifty and I've been in my company for about twelve years\nPretty a pretty good ten year for a burn employee must be a decent company if you stuck around for twelve years later a suggestion what do you think on this one of the plan\nMay or may not offer and in plan Roskam version feature some players do some plans don't just like they might not offered the role of options for a match or or anything like that every plans designed a little bit for sure so I think that's the first thing to think about but the second thing is by doing Ross conversion you are going to throw yourself into a different tax bracket\nSo I think it makes sense to talk to your CPA before you make any type of decision like that if you are going to ... so really\nIf the plant has a Ross feature\nMy advice would be utilize that rough you start saving Ralf as opposed to taking all this other money that you say pre tax and then oh by the way\nPaying taxes on all of it now you did mention earlier that quite often the matches on the pre tax portion correct that set up and he gets a writer so you would say still ... to to stick around with the up to the match anything you say the earliest over and above\nA probably go to the raw if you're trying to build a position in ... rhetoric and and the allegation should be about the same I Would say\nShe you know if the if the allegation in your traditional RA fits you then you should probably go with the same uh allocation just to kind of augment what\nYou're already it's important to look at everything you know as one you have to look at your IRA four one K. your brokerage account they're not all separate they are all part of your financial picture exactly what's important I talked to advisor like Jared to make sure everything is in line\nFor hours 'cause you know at the end of the day that this would be taxable event so if there was a conversion that took place\nYou you do need to talk with the attacks account maybe and see what the implications for you would be independent on that answer I mean I agree I think either\nThat or you do it because it makes sense for your situation based on the amount that you're you're thinking about converting or you say you know I'm not going to convert I'm just going to start saving a portion of what I was otherwise serving to the tax deferred part then start putting that into the ...\nUm and and that may be especially\nYou know in our case of fifty years old if he converted I think he's got plenty of time to make back what is going to go and tax and then you know the the result is he's going to be in a place where you know if he's fifty eight when that happens everything much beyond that age is now in a tax exempt account in what he pulls from it\nAfter fifty nine and a half there is no there was going to have to worry about much so\nWell and that's the other thing about the raw I don't know if we hit on earlier once you hit Seventy and a half in her off you know you do not have to take those required minimum distribution right where the traditional you do you have to do you're giving yourself flexibility on not just taxes but hey when I have to actually pull money because if you don't have to pull it you can leave it in there that's right\nAnd uh the the reason the government tells you that way is because they've given you in their minds a gift you got a you've got to save their tax revenue time yeah at some point but the the game is going to be up and they want their tax money is just a matter of a it's why they\nGo and there's
