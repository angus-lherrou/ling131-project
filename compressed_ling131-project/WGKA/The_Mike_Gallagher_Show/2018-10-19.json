I made the statement that the Senate ... that the people must rule eventually\nTo which the left is critics like uh this fellow from GQ would respond but the Senate prevents the majority from rolling so I'd like you to expand on on how in fact the majority will work its will as it did in the thirties and just take some time\nThat's right well so you know obviously if there's if there's a public opinion\nSo sewed\nMadison many there to supply and places in the federalist where Madison's a describes what will be achieved by the constitution and in the fifty first federalist forty ninth I Can't remember now sorry he says I'm a a\nIt is the reason alone of the people that should be placed in control of the government\nTheir passions should be controlled by it now how do you achieve that well you spread authority across the country that is what the Senate does but then the second thing is even bigger than that\nAnd this thing just the whole structure of the constitution if he were the argument to get rid of the Senate is an argument to get rid of the whole constitution because\nThe house has represented from districts every two years\nAnd the Senate is elected for six years from states and the president is elected nationally every four years and then a lot of the power is is lodged in the state and they have lots of different systems right\nAnd that means to get a big dramatic thing done you have to ... you have to ask the people their opinion over a series of elections\nAnd isn't it it's just you just gave the game away though um it's an attack on the constitution right it's not really an attack on the Senate it's an attack on the constitutional\nThe whole thing and and the to the end of what that's what we really got to get to wire people attacking the Senate in order to attack the constitution what is the motive Larry on what is their objectives\nWell we can't the attack on the competition started with the rise what was you know they've been several there was one one slavery became a big deal people decided they loved it under the influence by the way of a bunch of ... ideas of the evolution foreign to the founding of America\nThey they then they were attacking constitution\nAre supporting it you know abolitionists would attack the opposite is it protects slavery a southerners wanted more Confederate why more slavery would attack it because it doesn't give us enough protection for our slaves in the territories\nRight so these things are not new but the current one starts in the Eighteen eighties nineties Woodrow Wilson is a big author\nAnd what he says is this regime of checks and balance\nIt's a it's a like Newton like his picture of the universe but now we have dar one and we know the government is living organism and has to change right so the progressive movement is very impatient with this\nBecause the fact that people should understand is right the effect of the constitution is to make public opinion powerful in a sustained way\nIn the end even today where the government has its limits on more than half of the economy\nRight even today it does matter so very much what the people think and to sustain that and get that that's what the constitution does\nBut their idea that progressive Woodrow Wilson for example what he thinks is experts people who know people who can apply science to public policy should become much more influential in the government\nAnd that's what gives rise to this fourth branch of government which now makes most of our laws and in forces them and and educate them in their independent in ... hundred and fifty or so independent agencies\nThat that's where all that came from and it is by the way a change in the nature of sovereignty\nBecause sovereignty came in the in the American revolution according to the nature of the individual then you're born a person you're not born a horse or a dog and so you have to be by your nature govern only with your consent the new way is\nWe have power over nature now and if we use science and knowledge\nWe can perfect society and people who have that science and that knowledge they become a new kind of suffering and so of course the constitution must be swept away because it's specific\nAchievement is it keeps the people in control of the government for a long time\nAnd that is the whole game in every attack on the Senate and that is why today she'll fail dialogue needs to travel far and wide before these elections and hopefully we'll even got some no nothing's of constitutional intent and freedom\nBreaking news at breakneck pace this yourself Mike Gallagher show we're not going to make America great again it was never that\nStory we got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ...

talking to their family their friends they're making sure that everybody knows the importance of the election\nAnd something's happening right now with thousands of migrants marching towards the U.S Mexico border and the very image of that\nMotivates millions of Americans the very thought this is what President Trump\nWas elected to do is deal with this kind of extra sensual threat some segment last night on Fox News I couldn't get out of my head\nI watched a ... interview at the end of a young man in San Antonio who was evidently\nBurned alive by any legal who she befriended or became acquainted with and his work and his workplace and\nYou could tell Laura was so rattled by it and she was getting emotional and the air was emotional this kid was apparently full of promise and life he held down multiple jobs everybody loved him and somehow he got into some kind of older caged in with another young man who burned him alive who killed him\nMove the body burned his apartment I don't even know I looked at some of the details last night on line and I got so upset because I could not imagine\nThe unspeakable anguish a family has to feel when their loved one has been taken from them by somebody who shouldn't have been in this country to begin with and there's my drink trip right now in a a there's a Guatemalan Guatemalan border town\nI'm not going to pronounce your white so my apologies my Spanish not so hot but it's ... am on Guatemala members of the nearly four thousand strong migrate caravan\nHave gathered in this Guatemalan border town\nAcross the river from Mexico the group\nBegan arriving early Thursday they're arriving on buses and trucks hundreds walking to the river's edge where they sang the traditional national anthems of Honduras in Guatemala\nNow the way the a P characterizes this migrant caravan ... travelers the majority from Honduras dispersed to the local migrant shelter and parks were volunteers offered them food\nAnd let me go through all the stories of a twenty two year old named Jonathan paralysis who were ride with his wife Heidi and their daughters ages for him to they'd been travelling since for a um\nThey ride the barter border after dark they paid for bus tickets they could you afford\nJonathan said it was a great sacrifice but it's all for a better life it's not all good were wet and we still don't have a place to sleep\nNow this isn't this is an argument at a debate that we've been having since Donald Trump wrote down the escalator in Trump Tower and announced that he would be battling the problem of illegal immigration is president of the United states this is what he was\nElected to do is deal with a problem like this and\nFrankly I look at the optics of it and I look at the politics of it and I I I Want to get picked your brain\nBut from where I sit the timing of this is perfect\nPeople have been saying well you know the timing is politically motivated this caravan it's all the Democrats are are are responsible for this and they're just needed up it's all kinds of wild reports cash\nBeing handed out there is a video of cash being handed out to the migrants they don't know all the details between behind the money but it could be I don't know narco money whatever I don't know what's behind it I don't know if that's even accurate the video you got to be careful of stuff you see on the Internet but we do know\nThat thousands of migrants\nAre marching towards the U.S Mexico border with the intent of crossing the southern border into the United states\nAnd President Trump has made it very clear this will not stand\nWe're all sorry for people who feel oppressed in other countries that does not mean we can afford to have thousands of people poor across our border and enter our country illegally this is the ultimate blank you\nTo President Trump's desire to build a wall and secure our borders\nAnd frankly Democrats think this is great politically the optics of this are wonderful yeah I Do too I Do to\nAmericans elected Donald Trump largely because of the illegal immigration problem the last thing the Democrats need right now for those who are undecided those in the middle those who may not be motivated to go to the polls in November the ... the last thing Democrats need\nIs the image of thousands of illegals trying to march into our United States of America\nAt a time like this I guarantee you\nDonald Trump will respond accordingly I can promise you this country is not going to roll over for thousands of people who think they can be entitled to march across our border\nAgainst the law Democrats don't get it because they don't want to border Hillary show place she played her hand she showed her hand when she was caught on tape saying she dreams of no borders they don't want borders they want people flooding into our country\nNormal Americans do not\nI Hope this story continues to build I Hope there's more media coverage of this I Hope and pray Americans are watching and paying attention because if this story is as big as it seems to be becoming\nWe're going to win on November ... we're going to keep the house and we're going to keep the

who listen to us on the radio and support our message being Suzie as in the fuel\nIn a room like the the the the theater last night at the stress Center for the performing arts is so tangible so palpable and the excitement and the optimism the cautious optimism so many people have for the November ... mid term election is very real I don't know what's gonna happen\nBut I Know what ought to happen\nBecause too many great things are happening right now in our country and I it was fun to hear voices colleagues of mine friends to be on stage with huge humid and Dr Sebastian Gorka last night daily Mac and then he from the RMC to get different perspectives but we're all sort of rowing in the same direction we know\nWe know where the country is today and where we are heading as long as the voters continue to keep employed the Republicans\nIn control the house in the sense that all all roads lead to November the ...\nAnd we've got some real exercise central threats going on we got thousands of migrants headed for the U.S Mexico border from Honduras from Guatemala wonder what's gonna happen\nAnd isn't it fascinating and the Democrats think that somehow this is their political ... somehow they think it's to their advantage\nThe thousands of people are doubling down against the president who has vowed to close the border this is as far as many of us are concerned a threatened invasion of the United states I don't know how you describe\nThousands of people saying we're going to illegally cross your border and and and come into the United states whether you like it or not\nNot only with the American people not stand for\nPresident won't either and the ones who are out of touch the ones who are going to lose on this issue or the Democrats the crazy Democrats as President Trump called them last night and another one of his political rallies you had to stop and mental Montana more on that and just a moment\nIt's important for me to listen to sports voices and I tried to do that all the time when you call me\nAnd one eight hundred six five by my I listened carefully I think I Know my audience better than just about any radio host in America\nI Believe I was one of the few radio host nationally who saw the need and heard\nPeople say we don't want another politician in the White House we got to try something else I unwavering Hugh Hewitt by the way has this real weird tension he's got a strange sense of humor he likes to tell a crowd oh here's Mike\nGallagher ladies and gentlemen he's been a never Trump or from day one\nAnd of course I've got to try to correct him and everybody laughs but I'm always afraid that in a room full of six hundred people fifty or more think he's telling the truth\n[laughter] so I always have to correct you know you you're the one who actually wavered on President Trump in the beginning you're the one who had to come along you're the one we had to win over\nAnd for some they still have and what we haven't won them over rather they still haven't seen the light they still haven't recognize the extraordinary accomplishments of the first twenty months there to greet pieces I have in front of me one by Fred Barnes over Weekly Standard and the other one by John Dempsey\nAbout how Trump has read the Republican Party from the media I Want to start with a few I Want to start with the red barn speech over some facts because I like to argue with knowledge I Want to make sure that his you vote as you encourage your neighbors to vote as you get ready to go to the\nPolls don't believe the lie that somehow but rocked Obama\nSets the groundwork for this tremendous economy that we're enjoying right now Fred Barnes says in his column ... is a must read we're gonna posted it Mike online dot com if you want to read it Fred Barnes rights were rock Obama is a proud man\nAnd it was somewhat in Deering when he stoop to claim he had created the ground on which Trump's economy was growing the media sided with Obama no surprise\nTrump counter punch no surprise there either if the Democrats that won the election twenty six gene Trump said GDP which was about one percent and going down would have been minus four percent instead of up four point two percent Trump tweeted\nHe's referring before point two percent he's referring to the growth rate for the second quarter of twenty Eighteen\nI opened up our beautiful economic engine with regulation in tax cuts are system was choking and would have been made worse still plenty to do read Barnes writes the Weekly Standard Donald Trump is correct about the condition of the economy and late twenties sixteen it was weakening\nThe shift in economic policy to the right change the direction of growth from down to up\nThat's what tax cuts deliver and tax hikes do not here's the Fred Barnes writes about Obama and this lie that Obama is the reason for today's economy and again it spread puts it Obama's proud man\nIt's kind of in theory that he had such a head makes such a silly claim here are some facts\nOf Obama's successor Trump and the Republican Congress reverse Obama's policies\nThe fact is Obama had to struggle so hard to spur the economy and allow it to grow more than two percent a year that was the high water mark the bronco bomb in the last quarter of Obama's presidency growth had slipped to one point five percent\nIt's obvious what Obama's problem was you had the wrong policies will watch of wrong policies from the day Trump was elected\nWe've had a more robust robust economy\nFour million jobs have been at it for a million jobs unemployment is dip to the lowest point in nearly a half century ... Barnes says let's compare what Obama did with Trump\nWhat he's doing Obama raised taxes Trump cut that Obama was a regulatory salad Trump is passionate about deregulation Obama's clean Power Plan killed the coal industry Trump is reviving\nObama downgraded the role of entrepreneurs and free markets in boosting the economy and lauded the wonderful things government does Obama's biggest biggest breakthrough as we know\nWas the Affordable CARE Act a big step toward a single payer government run health care system Trump got rid of the individual mandates that forced everyone to buy expensive insurance or be fine a big step toward a return to free markets in health care\nBill the entire Obama economic agenda was systematically reverse says economics writer Stephen Moore\nWhose new book Trump ... we've got to get Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer Lance on the show one of these days presidents loved to tell their achievements in Trump's case\nA White House report issued recently said is administrators and had produced two hundred and eighty nine accomplishments in twenty months we all know Trump exaggerates and brags Fred Barnes rights but many of the economic gains willing pressure\nEspecially the fact that job openings out numbered job seekers for the first time on\nBeing a liberal himself Obama relied on liberal economists they let him astray as they did president John Kennedy in the Nineteen sixties they favored higher taxes to base favored increase spending\nThose policies created an economic downturn when Kennedy was smarter than Obama\nSays Brett he finally turned to his Republican treasury secretary she Douglas doing who recommended tax cuts JFK grabbed onto them and the result was an economic boom the roaring sixties rages advisors persuaded him the tax cuts championed by Jack Kemp\nWould do far more for the economy the spending cuts\nThey even use JFK's as an example the sweeping tax cuts of Nineteen eighty one brought about years of strong growth known as the Reagan Revolution Trump didn't need to be convinced obviously getting Republicans led by Paul Ryan believed it was time for deep cuts in the corporate tax rate the Obamas school of economists\nAnd commentators embarrassed by anemic results argued that economic growth was stuck perhaps permanently at two percent annually that mental bottles\nDoing the best any president could do certainly far better than Trump would have done right all kinds of dire predictions Washington Post should Trump could destroy the world economy Jason ferman chairman of Obama's council of economic advisors said Trump's budget assumes three percent annual growth that is extremely unlikely\nOkay how are ya I'm good thanks why do you think this will benefit the Democrats and not the Republican\nWell I'm worried I don't think I get worried because they're going to be a lot of kilter and families and yeah I'm afraid of like the whole than it rained out saying with the military there and everyone\nWas yeah it would be a weed out all this thing yeah yeah I I don't I think we're in a different time Laura I really do\nThis is a different time where people are fed up I I don't ...
