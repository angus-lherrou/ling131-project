Goff defines regeneration this way regeneration or new birth describes the inter renewal by the spirit of God\nWhich takes place when a person becomes a Christian\nAnd it's just the ABCs of the Christian faith the spirit has not alive unless you've been born again or converted or experience regeneration\nToo many of us come to church and start being religious we learn all the do's and don'ts of churches manatee we learn all the forms of the worship service we learned our church history we learn about doctrine we learn our bibles but if our spirits are not alive we're missing the whole point\nThe apostle Paul describes this and this way and second Corinthians five seven thing if anyone is in Christ he is a new creation they old has gone\nThe news come when\nThe Holy Spirit has made a live in us we become a new beans become fully alive is your spirit alive this morning is your spirit alive this morning\nOnce our spirit is alive it's essential that we began to grow spiritually I remember when I received Jesus Says my savior and lord at age twelve it was a real thing\nA real experience with God but no one told me that that relationship was supposed to grow to five years later I'm a senior in high school I still have the fate of a baby that I started back at age twelve\nOne of the things I like about Jesus is description of this event of a ... and when he calls it being born again\nIs that it conjures up the picture of a baby when one becomes born in the spirit here she is like a baby in their spirit and like the physical baby who needs to be nurtured to be taught how to eat how to talk to walk so it's the same spiritually\nWe must begin to learn how to live in the spirit and live by the Holy Spirit\nIt's process and it takes time it takes disciples ship that is it takes a more mature believer teaching a new believer out and walk in the spirit\nOne of the things that that I Hope we'll all be able to say and not too distant future when we talk to each other as long as you're Paul and who's your Timothy\nWho's your Paulette as soon as mentoring you spiritually no matter how far along we are and lord we need somebody to mentor is but then who's your Timothy who were you decide ... who are you nurturing who're you mentoring helping to grow in their life\nYou see this spiritual maturity just doesn't happen then just ... I Know there are plenty of examples in church history where people were taught by the lord or they read the writings of other people but we're mostly happens is one on one investment in people's lives\nDisciple shit regardless of how it occurs you and I need to understand the importance of nurturing our spirit it needs to grow it needs to be strengthened and it will take you into deep and since the with God help you know and understand the voice of the lord\nBut it needs to be matured\nSo third things morning as the importance of nurturing your spirit\nThe importance of nurturing your spirit and these are just a few ways to nurture your spirit and a variety of ways to approach each of these and in the weeks ahead we're going to examine a couple of days and further detail but I just want to share them with him most of you know these the first is daily Bible reading\nReading the Bible day by day it's dangerous\nSpirit I don't know how many times I have been dry spiritually and I opened the Bible and it's just like a weed or a flower soaking up the nutrients out of the ground\nDaily Bible reading daily prayer at is talking to God and listening to God listening to God learning to know his voice beginning to respond of his voice an ceasing prayer that's just talking to God all the time throughout our day and nurtures your spirit\nWorship both corporate and individual there's something about when we gather together as God's people and declare his praising worshipped him\nIt feeds the spirit to do that individually as well I don't know if you've ever had a time when you just get along with God and you warship them and you praising declare how awesome e is phases spirit\nHoly communion when we gather each week and partake of the body and blow of our Lord Jesus Christ it's scenes are spirit\nAbiding what I mean by biding his from John chapter Fifteen when Jesus Says if you remain in may and abide and me that day by day moment\nBy moment awareness of God's presence practicing the presence of God is rather Lawrence called\nAbiding in him obeying\nAlso feeds the spirit when you think the lord is telling you something to do or or not to do and you obey him\nGet feed your spirit strengthens you\nFellows ship with like minded believers\nYou ever just gather together with other believers and you begin to talk about the lord and you leave that gathering you just feel so full\nWitnessing or sharing your walk with others is another way to feed the sphere telling other people and God has been doing in your life [noise]\nYou ever done that [noise] just a natural

abusive demand was murdered [noise]\nBased on anything anybody can imagine it's indefensible morally indefensible crime was committed against the man\nThere's a lot about demands that I don't know I don't know what his views were used portrayed as a liberal in Saudi Arabia against an autocratic regime\nBut they're all the reports about him but no matter what his views that this is obviously not something we can morally accept the question that looms larger than that however is why is there so much attention being paid year\nDissidents or regime opponents in the middle east are routinely murdered a\n... it's one of the great puzzles of life but I think I have an answer to this one but it is often a puzzle as to why something dominate the news\nAnd something else doesn't the Saudi or the Saudi regime that got rid of someone wanted to get rid of\nAnd now in the year twenty Eighteen this is international\nNews to the extent that it is an ongoing daily story\n\nGiven how many people who who oppose Assad get tortured to death or\nIn the Egyptian regime or in other Gulf African regimes other Arab countries over Muslim countries they have many people have been tortured to death in Iran can be remaining won\nSo why why is this so much of a fixation\nThe question is not whether or not we accept what happens\nTo question is why is there a fixation on this man well one reason is he wrote columns for the Washington Post so he has a connection to the west and specifically to the United states and the other is that we have\nPhotographic data\nWith regard to the man walks into a consulate and never walks out pretty damning where we have that on video we have on video of Herman entering\nAnd we have the information about those men and during turkey and then leaving turkey so everything is obvious why the Saudi regime or elements of the Saudi regime would want to get rid of this man that's a puzzle to me\nDid you ever hear of this guy ah I'm I immersed myself in world affairs and I've ever heard of the guy and and\nAnd by the way and if you read the columns they're not exactly a cent leaving or revealing or or anything I mean it's the Washington Post walk to the Saudi ride around a lot of understand that but I Wish they had an Iranian writer\nWho was who was a dissident what's a guy would be a dead on arrival the away so here's my theory is why there were such preoccupation with this ban\nThere are two reasons in my opinion one is Saudi Arabia's ally of the United states and the media are far more preoccupied with\nThe bad things that allies do than the bad things the enemies do\nYou know you might want to ask why the call I don't know fully this is this is Dale speculation\n\nThey would I think they would argue we we have influence on the allies we don't have influence of enemies therefore\nOn those that we can influence we should try to have some influence that's the most noble read of the preoccupation with the deprivation of allies as opposed to the ...\nShouldn't of enemies by there's ... there's nothing on the dissidents in Iran and when you run did in fact have an uprising during the during the Obama administration as he essentially said nothing\nAnd the ... that was defended by the entire liberal slash left media because it was ... Obama\nSo back to the question why is there such preoccupation because one one is it you have a moral sense and it's a very important thing for a lot of people think well up themselves\nAnd we we can feel good about ourselves we are bringing to the world's attention\nSomething terrible that ... an ally of the United states is the second reason\nIs that he's not only an ally of the Saudi regime is not only in LA the United states an ally of the most hated man in the world most hated man in the world for the left is about Kim Jong un and it is about the Ayatollah Khamenei me\nA news not a it is not Bashar al Assad is Donald Trump is by far the most hated man in the world's media ... world's media run by the left and the left hates him more than any one\nAnd if she has a friend the friend is hated\nThose are the two reasons so why are we supposed to do here here's the question on the tape what are we supposed to do we can't deny him it's because it's it would be a lawyer and you can't tell lies can't deny what the Saudi regime that does it go up all the way to the crown prince we don't know\nBut that it was these are these are pretty well connected man apparently who are engaged in this murder\nSo why don't we posted to cancel a hundred billion dollars whatever what is the ... that they ever ordered in in a five hundred billion right\nThat's a lot of a that's a lot of jobs so you'll say well listen morale will be more important than jobs to which the answer is what is ... ... yes it is yes morality is more important than jobs however there are two\nBig caviar here one is jobs is a moral issue\nIt's not it's not unrelated to morality whether or not we can ... a ... a a naval tens of thousands of Americans to work\nBut if but murder is murder I I've I fully agree I have a hierarchy of moral good and the hierarchy of moral bad it's very big component of my moral thinking\nBought the a lot of say the Saudi regime or toppled because of sanctions by the United states first of all if they didn't have America to buy stuff from they would buy it elsewhere\nThey're not going to stop buying military equipment number two and most important if you really want to talk more real than the greatest moral good right now might be in the war on the world scene might be opposing Iran\nIran is the most evil actor on earth\nThe north Korean regime is the most evil regime domestically\nThe Iranian regime is the most evil regime in terms of foreign evil evil outside of its borders\nIt it's great enemy is Saudi Arabia\nNow you'll say so we are supposed to compromise our values because they're our ally and because the enemy of the ... the enemy is my friend no you don't compromise your moral values you speak out\nYou condemn you try to make that ally ... a more distant place but you don't abandon that ally because there are greater good the most obvious example being a man of didn't kill one dissident but about twenty five million\nKept that figure because it's not possible for the human mind to wrap itself around it and that is Joseph Stalin and we back Joseph Stalin knowing that you were slaughtering people in the millions because he was on our side against a greater enemy Adolf Hitler\nAnd that is the way the world works for people who are willing to look at the world the way it works not the way we imagine we allowed Jimmy Carter allowed the America under Jimmy Carter allowed the shah to step down in Iraq\nBecause of the various things that he did that were bad like his show ...\n[laughter]\nThat's that's the way it works on ... in the real world the real world is not pleasant and then the real world you will fight evil with people who are morally\nTroubled themselves\nAnd in this case it Saudi Arabia and ironically is happening when Saudi Arabia is becoming a morally better place that's the irony\nRight\nFeinstein Feinstein wants to reopen Kavanaugh hearings if the Democrats take control of the Senate\nDianne Feinstein has so deteriorated visit moral figure or because of the running against a radical left us She's just the regular leftist Kevin delay I'm\nSo for her the issue is how do I win\n\nNot bought his right they will open hearings again on the Supreme Court justice I Want you to understand something about the Democratic party today because it's a left wing level liberal party every institution it doesn't control wishes to destroy you realize that\nIt doesn't control the electoral college it wishes to destroy it does and wishes to and the electoral college it doesn't control the Supreme Court for the first time\nIn my lifetime and the lifetime of any of these senators so it calls the court illegitimate that it's a regular phrase\nThe the court is no longer a Supreme Court has no longer seen as legitimate because it's not left if it's not left it's not legitimate you understand\nIt's a force for chaos left as it is a false it just purely a tornado of destruction\nNow where was the article about how the Senate protects white voters against black voters and Hispanic voters did you see that it was the Washington Post I think what a bite of been the New York times they hate the Senate because\nThe Senate like the electoral college is state based not population based\nThis is the United states of America the states are to have their own world indeed genius I could cry about the genius of the founders of this country\nAnd their genius they wanted competing moral societies I was at work cold states to see which one works just they didn't they weren't so arrogant just to think they knew exactly what would\nWork really\nThat's why we have ... they\nSo now everything they don't control so legitimate one eight\nPrager seven seven six Dennis trigger show live from the relief

as the team man and there's a good reason for that\nI'm happy to welcome ... ... ... spotted forward to the show we reach them today and where are you ...\nI Am in Portland, Oregon\nOkay now in a nutshell Giuseppe youth poured more than thirty five thousand cups of tea for strangers around the country give me the backstory to that what you're riding around in and serving your tea out of and why serving strangers free T is so important to you\nWell you know I accidentally stumbled upon this power surveys very tea um I was one of those people in this country uh about forty percent of people in America or experience loneliness on a regular basis and what I found was that when I started having non monetary interactions\nWhere I actually just started simply sharing with people are dead my basic human needs for you know ... like my social and emotional basic needs started being that I'm\n... those being community genuine human interactions and things like that and so for the last Thirteen Years uh I've been traveling the country making the for free the last ten of those years has been an effort to live with a free T bus which is\nI'm a short school bus that's been converted into a little freaky house using a mostly salads materials running on recycled vegetable oil a solar power I'm actually a huddled up next to my woodstove right now making a cup of tea on the woodstove so\nThen you soon as I used to live at the end of Lou right\nI've lived in that and to live for a little over ten years\nSo so what were you doing when the ... before you hit the road what were you doing and where\nI'm I was working full time of the video editor in Hollywood, California um when I first started serving T although I I had been either limited my pickup truck at that point for um for about six months to try you know I I was in college basically before that it went from college to devote I've lived them\nSo you pull up into a new city and started brewing tea and what sort of open the back of the back of your a mobile unit or put out a table and people walk by and say when a cup of tea is that it's that simple\n... pretty much I put out freaky signs I invite people in the inside of the U.S they really pose the warm woodwork space it feels like when people come in it's a lot of people take a deep breath and they say I feel like I'm home\nOh my goodness and you have made I Know lifelong friends who had people invite you into their own free dinners to stay there to shower there to hang out with the kids and meet their friends and and there's also you also gift sometimes and receive gifts I Know that's not you know a formal thing do you tell me about that\n[noise]\n\nSeven eight hundred three eight seven eight to five one eight hundred three eight seven

these sixteen Ninety two sailing witchcraft walk that you offer\nSure um well failings preparing and we prepare every year a week at one point five million visitors a year and then during uh during the ... of Halloween falls on a Saturday\nOr in October we can have like a hundred and twenty five thousand people and you know I'm so we're always prepare it and try to make things better bring cable

we love telling them about it and it's a compelling story\nI'm sure than either of you know the Salem historical tours and the haunted put stuff goes towards a lovable\nA there was the oldest walking tours in Salem, Massachusetts from what we understand your tourist thing offering combo of history with a dose of those grim details in keeping with the Halloween being so for listeners around the country who might want to come to Salem at this point hoping to see her experience it goes what can you tell them that do come away with\nUm well you know we're a combination of a lot of things so the witchcraft trials everybody knows about we're also for the oldest city in Massachusetts we are older than Boston um we are the logo is great stories begin here so we were an incredible a port\nA we had over two hundred and fifty ships going around the world during\nBoth Seventy nine eight Eighteen fifty a and it's um\nThe wealth of the nation was here in Salem in the early Eighteen hundreds we were the one percent a but it all comes crashing down due to various factors so dumb incredible revolutionary history as well\nAnd nice combo tours they just kind of um you can take a call ... get the ghost story which to get the poor history\nOn average finance looking on your website and I saw gallery episode out of this is from people that have taken the to win or everything goes I mean these are that's an awful lot of oddities on these tourists um have you ever seen a ghost or what you think might have been against\nOut absolutely I'm definitely have to go um\nWe ah well one of the house
