today we got a lot of reasons to celebrate but I Want a war you we can win the battle and lose the war and the judge Kavanaugh\nAnd in particular President Trump won the battle Saturday with judge Kavanaugh's confirmation the last thing you can do now is breathe a sigh of\nRelief and say a good we got this major battle one we don't need to go to the polls\nIn a few weeks we can stay home\nThat's the last thing you can do\nAnd I I it's really weird I've been thinking a lot about Roseanne Barr over the last couple of days\nBecause it says if for the first time there was a push back to the left demand that somebody's head would be on a platter over something\nBut in this case wasn't corroborate first time this has happened I mean normally careers are gone lives destroyed people's lives are away into the darkness never to be heard from again this time Brett Kavanaugh fought back\nThis time Republicans reunified on the political front\nWe witnessed a unification within the Republican Party that we haven't seen it a couple of years\nOr more\nAnd I was thinking about how somebody can be destroyed over something like a tweet\nAnd you know at the end of the day may be may be\nThe push back on behalf of judge Kavanaugh and the Republicans deciding no we're not going to destroy this man over this one accusation I Know there were a couple but\nThe the first one was the one that was deemed credible you notice the you hear the Republicans who read the FBI report\nThe word credible is used for Dr Ford she's seen credible is what all of them said\nIt just wasn't corroborated so you couldn't\nEver ever take him down over her testimony alone\n\nA couple of times I've seen some references to Roseanne Barr evidently that show that she created and return to is going to be back I don't think it's returned yet the beers that next week or this week they're going to call it the Connors\nAnd they apparently killed off Roseanne all because of her tweet about Valerie Jarrett and it was make no mistake it was a terrible sweet\nBut it was a tweet one tweet\nAnd her lifetime of work was suddenly consumed by the fire of the rage machine PS she's a Trump supporter\n\nI saw over the weekend there was a a an NBC reporter I Believe a young and be she reporter who a few years ago\nWrote a bunch of homophobic tweets because then they will happen to her no she's a liberal NBC report the Roseanne and you re tweet or\nTweet out a racist comment about Valerie Jarrett you're done\nAnd maybe after Kavanaugh\nWas pulled over the finish line by a unified Republican Party in a fight or river president air fighting spirit on his part\nMaybe just maybe\nMob rule\nWill be brought down a few a few notch maybe the mob won't continue to win\n\nThe mob didn't win this time\nThe mob loss there were so many videos I was watching over the weekend I traveled to Florida for a long story but kind of look at it properties around the country and maybe I'm\nLooking to relocate and uh just to the tax situation they're good at chase me out of New York I mean there's just it's insane\nI just refuse to keep paying whatever it is fifty three percent tax and I'm looking and I I don't know anybody in Florida but I I Know some people in Florida but there's a beautiful parts of Florida Texas I don't know yet so anyway I went down to Fort Lauderdale over the weekend was checking out some things there\nSo I'm watching everything in the hotel and I'm In the car and I've got satellite radio so I'm listening to to Fox News and\nAnd I was just I was just stunned that the way this is all playing out I'm listening and I'm listening and I'm watching this thing progress and I'm thinking by guy she's going to get this and I was really negative\nBecause we're in a culture now\nThe mindset is the the meat to activists many of them say accusation made accusation believe he believes the accusation\nThat means you have to condemn the accused thats the formula although I Will say and I'd like to find land\nOr the audio clip from to wanna Burke\nIs the founder of the me to move it from years ago this is not this is a woman an activist who started this a long time ago it's just now gotten kind of resurgence with the Harvey Weinstein and stuff\nShe set on on meet the press yesterday\nBelieves the woman doesn't mean don't have an investigation he said it never meant you believe the woman you stop there and you're ruined the person's life she said believe the woman means you listen to the woman you believe that nobody is probably going to come forward and make it an accusation but you have to\nGet an investigation you have to\nCorroborate and I was ... I was really relieved to hear her say that she after all was the woman who founded this whole me too movement\nAnd that's what happened with Brett Kavanaugh there was an investigation seventh one actually I saw senator on TV over the weekend I forget which one who said yeah there have been a hundred and fifty witnesses\n\nOver the course of the investigations into Brett Kavanaugh's past not one of those people said there was a problem with drinking so there was a problem with sexual inappropriate\nAnything other than the ... and ... there was nothing other than an exemplary life over sevens FBI invested investigations\nI Wonder who could survive that kind of scrutiny\nPresident Trump over the weekend at a rally in Topeka, Kansas is cutting operate path later ... talking about the mob mentality of today's Democratic Party in twenty Eighteen and will this overreach will this mob will this anger do that in\nA November the six or will there anger or will there anger\nFigure out a way to\nGet Democrats across the finish line I'll play that for you when we come back and got a lot to do here the relief factor dot com studios it's on Monday and watch the text messages saying praise God my prayer works\nOne a day when Susan ... listen friday night with Susan Collins friday afternoon\nTook to the podium one minute in her speech I said she's a yes\nYes it all came down to Susan college we've got some of that audio and video is well we're live streaming it Mike online dot com wanna watch the show as you listen to his on the radio I'd love to get your reaction to my insistence I hate to me the school arm here I don't want to take any joy from your heart this was a great day\nThat the conservatives are now in the majority of the Supreme Court for many years to come it's a five four solid conservative\nAnd that's great news for this country moving forward but again\nThis is the battle the war has to be one November the ... so that this can continue one eight hundred six five five Mike let's see if you agree with me or not eight hundred six five five six four or five three color texture voiced your perspective your reaction to history being made\nWith associate justice Brett Kavanaugh get your take on coming up\n\nGo let you know you're not being used to years ago you were trying to build sorry\nSir I just don't just almost all ...\nYou just wanted to a vote for the person but now it's past that you really got to vote for the court is before we left now\nIt's so far live there you go to a\nLargely because that party is what's responsible for the behavior that we've witnessed over the last few weeks you've got to vote Republican across the board you just got to vote for Republicans everywhere you go to vote for Republican governors you got to vote for Republicans in Congress you have to report ...

the police officers who've been killed in the line of duty but\nOfficer Jason Van Dyke in Chicago\nA friday afternoon was convicted of second degree murder\nAnd sixteen counts of aggravated battery with a firearm in the death of liquid and McDonalds he is the uh the teenager who was carrying a knife but the video showed the dash cam video showed he was veering sort of away from the officers\nWhen he was shot dead the jurors found officer Van Dyke guilty\nAnd the jurors said they just didn't by the defense of the officer that it was his they wanted him to trust his memory not really the dashboard camera video to know what really happened [noise] um you know one of the things that strikes me about this guilty verdict\nWhen there is cooperation ... via a dash\nCam video or body cam video often a police officer who was guilty of a terrible terrible crime and this was this was a bad shooting this was not he was not defending his life and you can see from the video the kid was walking he was high on apparently PCP he was walking away from the officers\nHe had a knife in his hand but they shot him or officer Van Dyke shot him sixteen times um when it happens and there's cooperation\nOfficer police officers are always held accountable for their ears accountability and there are consequences for a police officer making a mistake guess what\nHappens all the time the officer in South Carolina who shot the guy in the back remember that the the the gentleman who was fleeing because of a a traffic stop and the guy just stood there and braced shot him a bunch of times in the back and killed him a kid caught that on tape\nIt was corroborated and now that guys riding in jail officer Jason Van Dyke is going to go to jail for a long time was convicted of second degree murder this happens\nAll the time in America when there is proof an officer is held accountable so the narrative of the black ... of the of the protesters and the the football the NFL Miller's that officers always get away with shooting unarmed black man and it's open season I talked to just not true\nAnd there are times I Am sure when officers try to protect themselves and they do get moral and legal things to try to save their own Fannie\nBut frankly the nation I think breathed a sigh of relief when officer Van Dyke was convicted on friday um this kid and I don't know how it would have\nPlayed out and as I shared with your the video from a week ago when a guy with a knife was lunging at a manager or a security guard rather in a Burger King in midtown Manhattan right across from the Port Authority and I thought you know what if there was a police officer there and this guy was lunging at a cop the way he loves to this security guard right in front of me as I was trying to eat my Walker and\nRe my papers in peace [noise]\nThey would have had to shoot this guy\nBut that was not the case with a\nWith a look one McDonald officer Jason Van Dyke\nAnd so at the end of the day the jury said I think the jury got it right\nAlways hurts when an officer is convicted which you know what there has to be accountability and in Chicago on friday there was [noise]\nYou'll agree we can dive into that next hour\nAlso did you hear about you know Steven cold beer is appears Trump hater\nOf his writers tweeted it was just glad at least that they ruined Brett Kavanaugh's\nLight that was the goal of the limb wasn't it that it more as we continue this busy Monday edition of the Mike Gallagher show they're really factor dot com studios [noise]\nFor a new set of breakneck face this is

street when Brett Kavanaugh became confirmed as a United States Supreme Court justice\n[noise] it felt great because the odds were against him in fact I wavered I didn't think he was going to go across the cross the finish line I told some friends and family I thought no there's no way\nWhen the third and fourth novel oddity pops up in the media wrapped everything up and kept publishing and posting every allegation it was just too much\nI thought was that after kill your thing happened\nA rare thing happened Republicans rally unified fought back\nSenator Lindsey Graham actually became Spartacus [laughter] he was the real Spartacus and\nHe promised over the weekend he's going to continue to fight he's doing something he's never done before he said he's going to campaign against
