supposed to have a prayer Marsha Blackburn is run away with it in Tennessee though she'll run through the wire\nCongressman Kevin Cramer is going to beat Democrat Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota attorney general Missouri Josh Hawley is going to beat Claire McCaskill in Missouri Mike Braun is going to beat Joe Donnelly who voted against Kavanaugh in Indiana Rick Scott is tied that is a dog fight down in Florida\nMatt Rosendale in Montana is closing in on Jon Tester who voted against Kavanaugh John James in your own state um the amazing West Point graduate Apache attack helicopter flying African American MBA from in Detroit is gaining on Debbie Stabenow\nAnd Bob Haagen in New Jersey is a is gaining on these simply unacceptable as a moral issue Bob Menendez what do you read and that is sort of like a sweeping\nRejection of the Democratic argument that all these Republicans were surging\nIt so first of all headwind for you know the party if if the Republicans control the house and the Senate and the presidency [noise]\nThe typical number of seats lost in such a campaign is twenty five\nTwenty five would flip the house or the in in in a according to Gallup in a in a year in which the president is unpopular\nAnd see the Trump is unpopular that means he's about fifty percent and nobody gets much better than that these days right but then the average will be thirty seven percent nobody's predicting that right now\nNow the election may well break one way or the other they often do but for the last two weeks as you point out the Republicans have been strengthening and isn't that odd shouldn't there be that's I think that's one of the reasons why\nThere's furious a reaction from the far left from their point of view this man was unacceptable and everybody should see it by now\nBut you know Rick Scott's very close and Florida and the news this morning is Trump is on his way back down there again yep that means Rick Scott wants him to come so yeah I think that uh\nIt is a dog fight this election I don't think we know how it's going to go and uh\nI think it matters very much which is a question you were asking because if you ... since any weapon can you know Paul Ryan pointed out that eighty percent of the bills they passed and they passed a lot of them were bipartisan fails well\n... thank God for that is it's it's the same phenomenon is the fact that most Supreme Court cases are decided by overwhelming majorities most of them nine to nothing I think right but but at at\nAn all of the difficulty cases and all of the cases that raise questions of which what is the direction of the country we are deeply divided and the house will be used as a weapon to fight the administration if the Democrats take it and then if you want that and that's what you should vote for\nAnd I got to go back to the end clothes on what you just said the media is deeply invested in the idea that President Trump is bad and should be rejected therefore if he isn't repudiated his party isn't repudiated in either house but certainly if it isn't repeated in both of them\nThe media will be face to face with the fact that they are not representative of the country they think they are representative Bob and they are not leading a the population in the way they think they are entitled to lead and I think that is a source that is the bottom line is that people feel toppled from their purchases of power\nYeah and that's been a problem with Trump for a long time but that's not a particular Trump problem just remember\nIt became since the Nineteen sixties and not before by the way since the birth of centralized bureaucratic administrative rule a different kind\nOf rule from constitutional the path\nTo political prosperity has to be the candidate of change and to run against the establishment in Washington and they have become increasingly unpopular with time\nAnd they've reached the peak now right and and we we don't we don't just say that Congress is unpopular\nBureaucracies unpopular and the executive branch is unpopular and the media is unpopular everything in Washington DC is unpopular\nAnd and what Trump did was he managed to Marshall that into a presidential campaign and if you look at the campaign to the Republicans who succeeded Reagan\nBreaking news at breakneck face this is Mike Gallagher show we're not going\nTo make America great again it was never that\nWe've got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ... Nineteen Seventy eight ... voice of clarity for millions of Americans go low we came up\nWith the Democratic party was if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house and doors ... started\nThe show known by the most famous man on the planet\nAnd you've been grade Mike and I appreciate it very much you notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot com studio Mike\n[noise]\nHorrible events took place over the weekend [noise] and\nThere are people who want Republicans to win next week and there are people who want Democrats to win next week I Want to give you an example of somebody who doesn't want Republicans when he's a former Republican but now because he is a star on MSNBC he caters to the left\nAnd this is what Joe Scarborough literally said about the anti Semitic massacre that occurred over the weekend in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at a synagogue or a synagogue beer I Want you to let this sink in and recognize\nThe type of people who don't want Republicans in control in Washington DC here's an example it's despicable ugly nasty\nHorrible example of somebody who wants to the Republicans to lose in next week's mid term election this is from it I shouldn't be she\nAngry\nPeople on Fox News and talk about the caravan as if this is a big election issue now what's all I Know there were a thousand miles away [noise] know that the last caravan that they ... frenzy about actually only brought fourteen around us by the end of the care of and they know it's a lie\nAnd there are spreading hatred or across America or and and at the end of the day Mika again inspiring people like miss Pittsburgh mass murderer\n[laughter] she's showing me 'cause I think people like you and me inspired the man\nIn Pittsburgh to massacre eleven congregants of the tree of life synagogue\nThey think that people on MSNBC or old all a completely and entirely blameless for this so called tone in America\nWe are in such a weird dangerous period of time\nPeople like this jerk Joe Scarborough and his fellow jerk Mika Brzezinski influence millions of people people that think they're in the know their celebrated their they are are lifted up as\nIntellectual heavy weights inside the beltway just just flooding us habit letting us know the way it really is people on Fox News inspired a madman account hating madman incidentally which had the ... really ticked off the show and Mika\nIf he only had a mug I had been there day could have been complete\n'cause they're still not finished celebrating the fact that the guy who sent out the mail bombs is a Trump supporter they just love that they ... their teeth into that didn't lay\nThe sickness is is a sickness it's an evil pushed through the sickness\nThat some of these people have and they are people who influenced other Americans daily\nWith that but you know here's the irony of irony\nThe\nIn the media all wringing their hands\nSupposedly worried about the tone that could lead to mail bombings or synagogue shooting ...\nThey don't care about the tone that code the code is this president rolls up his sleeves and fights and they don't like it he has knocked over the establishment of apple cart and they don't like it so they're never going to miss a chance to blame Trump and his supporters\nEverything that goes wrong in this country the Washington Post literally rolling in an article recently said you can't compare Trump and Hitler because\nThere's no comparison Trump is far worse than Hitler\nThey said that I mean last can finally at the headlines I when I saw it at first I thought it was a joke it was a goof it was one of those you know onion kind of know they really said that\nOne man was a murder is horrific monster or the other one was a con man they were talking about the murder is horrific monsters Trump and the con man was with Hitler they were just Hitler to just a con man you see Trump's worse than Hitler\nI don't even respond to this kind of stuff they want to talk about\nThe tone but they don't own any of it they called Trump a traitor a racist a massage ...\nThey call the monster the Columbus Day every day every hour of every day it is relentless is on ending and they won't even have the intellectual honesty to say well we can be considered part of the problem too were part of it\nIf there's tone that's everywhere oh no no I didn't even\nCome up against this Fox News Fox News\nDares to have voices on its air support President Trump CNN done MSNBC done ABC doesn't ... none of them they don't they don't have feature pro Trump forces with any consistency they just they just sprinkle them in once in a while like a like a\nLike an exotic animal zoo oh look there's the bottom of the horn toad\nOn CNN he actually likes Trump now let's get 'em off part let's get rid of him put him back that put get him back off the air give me three minutes let's all yell at him and shame them off the air but we put on\nThe spot in horn tone was appearing no I I don't all I Know is we have an election day after tomorrow\nI mean a week from tomorrow or not they after about a week from tomorrow we're eight days away you want accuse me of politicizing things I don't care I Want the adults in control because none of the Joe Scarborough is of the world or the my Gallagher's the world for that matter matter you know who matters you matter all of\nThis
