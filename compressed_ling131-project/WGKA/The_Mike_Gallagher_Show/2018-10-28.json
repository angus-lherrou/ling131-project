{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "His dad thought about it a while and said sure so any volunteer you see God and put the desire in his heart\nIs one of the ways the lord will guide us he puts the desire there the light yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart any now is probably I Would say that one of the best communicators of the gospel in the United states and I are a lotta preachers\nHe's awesome he volunteer\n'cause God put the desire there that versus the light yourself in the lord and he will give you that means he'll place within you it doesn't mean that you have this desire your heart and God's going to give it to you if I Do I didn't know if he's decided to live in him he's going to put his desires\nIn my heart [noise]\nWhen I was a kid people were afraid to become Christian because they were worried about godsend in Africa as a missionary as so many older remember that that was kind of the line\nOf course now they're sending missionaries here which is a sign up but here's what happens though as you begin to follow the lord and and you serve him he puts the desire in you to do what he wants you to do\nSome of the off come to me with ideas from ministry and the church or you'll come to the leadership team since ... you know we ought to do this and do that\nWith God's put the desire in your heart chances are you're supposed to do that no one expects somebody else to do it if they put the desire and your heart chances are he's calling you to do that\nThe lord will speak in a variety of ways\nBut it's up to us to become tuned up here\nOr to listen become tuned up to hear the list and there's some things we can do to tune into here as I said to not to hear the lord and these are some spiritual exercises that we can build into our lives to cultivate our spirits to hear him\nWith all the noise in our lives if you practice these exercises like you practice your physical exercise you will cultivate a spirit to here in the ... and\nThe first to silence silence build times of silence into your life\nTurn off the TV turn off the radio turn off the computer a turn off the iPod have\nQuiet time in your life no noise quiet no talking quiet silence now some people can't stand this [laughter]\nThey can't walk into a room without turning on the radio or the TV\nBut you can work on it and you can grow into it\nBut silences king you will not hear the voice the lord without some silence and your life a second exercise to build into your life the solitude solitude not just being quiet but being alone closure\nDoor go into the inner closet in and be alone with the lord solitude\nThe best way to start your day every day\nIs to get along with the lord for an hour and be quiet before him I recommend once a quarter you you ought to go off for twenty four hour\nPeriod or get away for twenty four hours and cut out the noise cut out in the people and be alone with the lord\n\nIt's amazing how your spiritual ears will will tune in the gods voice when you spend time alone with him in solitude a third thing which many of you already doing is reading and studying the word\nOf course when one is quiet and one is spending time alone with the lord is important to read and study the word of God God is already spoken to us through his word and it's important to be reading it to be studying to be memorizing it to be meditating all she needs to reflect on her dwell on\nAgain is amazing to me how many times I Will be going through something in my life\nAnd the word will just speak right to it or where I memorized the scripture and I'll be going through something and the Holy Spirit will just put that right there\nLike a few weeks ago I was struggling with something or thinking about something in the end the as to what I knew about this and immediately flip eons for Nineteen jumped into my mind which says my God will supply all your needs according to his riches and glory and Christ Jesus to read and study the war\nAnd then there's ... prayer and not just prayer but ... ... per intercept three prayers when we\nTalk to God on behalf of others we put ourselves in the gap on behalf of them when we will talk to God on behalf of others he will talk to us\nAs we spend time praying and he will communicate to us he'll share with us how to pray for that person sometimes he gives us the big picture sometimes he tells us that we're praying for the wrong thing\nWe need to be praying for this intercept re prayer\nAnd another spiritual exercise what you've heard me talk about before is to keep a prayer journal a prayer journals I signed the lord often speaks as you write down your prayers I don't know about\nYou but sometimes I encounter what I call satanic static and I'm having my quiet town to fork lord and I'm trying to pray to him next thing you know my mind's over here thinking about this and that and this and that and say wait a minute I'm supposed to be praying and you get back to any way\nWhen you write your prayers it's focused like a laser beam you stay on task but then I've also found and I shared this with him before if you will begin to write down with the lord and presses upon your mind from him to you and just write it as it comes he will speak to you\nThe key is being open the gods speaking as you write what he brings into your mind it's amazing\n[noise] years ago I came across a book by Henry now and called the way of the heart I recommend that to you to learn how to develop the solitude and silence and interests were prayer in your life and in between the services I was\nTalking with Sam watch and um he can for a little saying about you know the more bars you have the more you can hear\nLike with your cell phone you know the more bars you have the more you can hear the more you put these in practice the more than that you put in practice in their life the more you will be able to hear God the more you'll be able to listen to him and understand what he's saying to you God wants to speak to you\nThat was another area that we need to touch on about the voice of the lord and cultivating listening spirit and that the area of obedience obeying God the lord said the Abraham and genesis twenty two Eighteen\nAnd ... all the nations of the earth be blessed because now has obeyed my voice\nThe lord to Jeremiah Jeremiah seven twenty three but this thing I commanded them saying obey my voice and I will be your God and you should be my tape\nOne thing I've learned about the voice of the lord when he speaks he expects me to obey when he speaks to you he expects you to obey him and if you don't have a guess what happens he stopped speaking\nWhat's the point\nAnd the other thing I've learned is that if you have no intention of obeying the lord\nHe won't speak again what's the point why should he tell you anything\nObedience is very important to hearing the voice of the lord\nFor those of you are really in the Bible study and encourage you to to get you can corners out and look up and the voice of the lord\nI Am not going forward is on my computer and so I can type in voice the lord like you would do something and it gives me all the versus in the Bible that has that phrase it\nIs amazing how many\nBible verses where the voice of the lord is mentioned and obey isn't the same verbs God expects us to him bay and when he speaks to [noise]\nHe wants to be [noise]\n\n\nThat was Dr beach with today's message for more information on this message and this ministry please visit a work lord dot

Tampa\nI'm not replacing text book but it's up there there is ... yeah it does it while you're right 'cause how often the worst thing that the troops exactly right\nWhat is it painful things then I Want to give it to the president's speech last night I got a lot to talk to you about but one of the painful things to me about\nThe lease attacks on America and specifically white Americans is how many wonderful white Americans there really are [laughter]\nTo ... to the fame I mean they're wonderful people of every group obviously but you're only allowed to the same white Americans is if there's something particularly noxious about white America\nWhat America is a lot of beautiful people with it it's really disgusting it's just disgusting\nBehavior so overwhelmingly from one direction but it's just painful but people live in denial of that\nThe way I commend to you my column my Tuesday column I my nationally syndicated column comes out on Tuesdays I commend it to you\nNational Review town hall Dennis brag about calm America greatness many uh many places Kerry and many local newspapers most recently the Cleveland Plain dealer\nToday's top political it is it is about the question based on my experience of car dealers last week on the issue of male ambition specifically\nAnd other matters of young people talk about later I Want you to hear some clips the president spoke in Houston\nOr yesterday to a an enormous crowd or they they ... Eighteen thousand still be arena\nAnd you know who who get those numbers on the left and I I I'm not making an argument on I'm asking the question who does get those those Brock Obama get those numbers I Am very curious\nAbout who gets those numbers on the left anyway\nI ah I Want you to hear about some of the things first there's this one is very powerful or about who we worship wanna wanna play that one show\n[noise] we\nWe proudly stand for our national\nFaith and family [noise] not government in Iraq\nPart of the center of American Life so true\nWe don't worship\n[noise] now it's so I when I listen to these things this is just a habit of a lifetime when ever I listen to such things like whenever I speak I hear the voice of West is in my brain\nBitch an automatic response to me it's almost ... how exactly is someone on the left responding and of course they load everything was just shit load that\nShowed that usually give away as to this very important distinction between left and now what do you lows was just said if you don't you're not a ...\nAnd what is it exactly that is low some about it so let's go part by part let's begin again if you would show on with the kneeling and the flight\nKneeling and the flag\n[noise] we\nWe proudly stand for our national\nSo hold on their ... why is that loads\nBut we proudly stand for our national anthem and for our national flag why why would that be loads up\nTo a leftist\nIt's worse than it's worth analyzing I'd like you to play this\nFor a friend and say listen I just want to understand how you think I'm not going to argue I Wanna I I assume that you find is objectionable so let let let me in ... what is bad about that we ... proudly stand\nFor our national anthem and our national flag\nAnd by the way I frankly\nDon't know the answer I almost always know what a leftist will say but I this one's a tough one what what are they going to say to proudly stand for the national anthem of the national flag gives an act of white supremacy I it's a code word for bigotry\nIt's a a dog whistle to Xena phobia wanted I don't know exactly what they would find I Know they find it frightening and disgusting and the thought of Eighteen thousand people cheering for a further reinforces\nTheir disgust but I I really want you to understand\nThat it's a fairly recent vintage in American Life\nThat people would find a president saying we proudly stand for our national anthem and our flag to be disgusting let alone fascist okay this is this is because we have gone so far left\nBeyond where the left was even one generation to go next please\n\nFaith and family not government bureaucracy\nAt the center of American Life so true\nI'll tell you All right so hold on there so so so yeah so ... okay so what would a left to say what's wrong with their faith in families the truth center of the American democracy or not what is it government them bureaucracy\nSo you may recall a democratic convention a number of years ago we played it on the show a number of times I was I was actually at that convention I heard it live\nWhere they ... the ... the a narrator the dmc that whatever term is used for the voice of a convention the resident voice\nGovernment does what Americans all Americans have in common or is the one thing all Americans share something\nTo that effect they really do believe that it has supplanted fate and family government and a bureaucracy he's right about that see it's\nFour percent of the west as soon as the president says something to a crowd in particular it it is considered Neal fishes stick and all the usual adjectives throw it out but I I really want to know from people what is wrong with that is faith and family not to the center\nThe lynchpin of American Life should not be admitted that it's that it's gradually no longer the case of faith and family forty percent of Americans born to unwed mothers now and faith is dwindling\nBut\nIs that a good thing but it's a question to ask a a percent of the washed in your life mixed number three claim number three of the president\nAnd above all else we know that is in America\nWe don't worship\nIt was as if he took a line in a ... plying them not out of my mind that that he is I'm just saying it was it was as if he would be from my current\nVideo up at ... or you ... university on the American trinity that's exactly right because as government gets bigger God get smaller and the western world that's exactly what is happening government has some place the state has replaced gal that\nThat is entirely accurate so there were three claims all of which would be found disgusting on the part of the left now when we get back I Will\nPlay you left wing reactions to another comment that he made in Houston last night and this will\nAnd I so I'm just wondering is that what he that's obviously no I shouldn't even ask that is obviously what\nHe is dating it's a term of the all right so if you ... you so again folks this is to educate you\nThis this is not this is not even to advocate a position as much as to educate\nFor the last nationalism has always always always been a dirty word\nFrom Carl Marx all Carl Marx wanted to see the end of the nation state he wanted the world to define itself knocked by nationality not by national identity bought by class\n... of the world you night so he believes that the\nProblem with Terry to Germany and the ... of Russia have much more in common with one another than they have with fellow Germans or a fellow Russians\nLike almost everything else march was wrong Marx used the or perhaps the most wrong influential thinker in history I mean he's just almost always wrong but it doesn't matter it truly doesn't matter\nBecause it was never empirical member empirically based anyway his theories even though he called them scientific\n\nThe the world is not to be divided by ... mission is an anachronism nation leads to bad stuff slash is what matters the left has never changed it loads national identity it ...\nIt takes your primitive if you have a national identity this is exactly why did he left\nThere was so much snickering that ... you might have wondered was it me or or what was happening\n\nThat's what\nThat's what happened when played last night I'm Don Lemon so the first comment\nIs this is a statement of the all white nationalism is a good word is a statement of the all white continue\n\nOr are we having a problem back in ... right and is loaded with native is and\nRacial undertones and global as well global is having uses a slur\nOkay hold on hold on okay

there a how the nightlife with tons of new restaurants I've never seen a unique museum like the American sign museum and someone I'm thinking of the city's flushed with new hotels and people\nI I think it really returned to the downtown area and a big way and I know is on the planet named Cincinnati as one of the ten destinations to make its twenty Eighteen best in the U. S. list that huge could this why\nIt's absolutely why we have made started African so much investment in our downtown core riverfront twenty blocks north up to our over the rice area really create a sense of vibe in the\nRestaurant management or would like to call them are skeptical that are popping up in these really great faith\nTo create an experience that you know when you come in to say that it it feels like a major metropolitan city they don't feel like you're in the mid west are stepped away toward every single day and we just had my Santos and clean and take over the James Beard house in New York about a month ago and created a Cincinnati native with one of the only nice filled out all year\nAnd it's certainly just five and a feeling of really to electricity and just to gauge happening\nA lot going on there sure yeah so what we'll switch gears just a bit for the business travelers in our audience Cincinnati and Delta Airlines you know there's certainly synonymous than and we'll link the city is also a draw for some of the top design shops in the country they're also home to a major corporations like Proctor and gamble Macy's kroger's and you have the pro sports teams like the rent and the bangles\n[noise]\n\n\nEight hundred three eight seven eight oh two five one eight hundred three eight seven zero to visit his online at all round moral travel by bus baseball canister rant that are and moral travel now want them\nTo America's number one\nOff the board you're listening to our two of the nation south probably travel chefs top travel radio show excuse me Robert Mary Karen are glad to have your joining us today it's just after eleven am eastern time on Saturday and this final weekend of October so Robert\nVery I Know we've got an email segment coming up this hour but here's something not to do\nThe next time many of us travel ... night as a man is the name of the manager at the Delano a Delano South Beach hotel in Miami she landed Miami grabbed her bag from luggage carousel was shocked to open it later to find it filled with airline equipment like work boots and safety best some power scripts\nSo if you read right on Twitter and advise the world that never fly American Airlines at the contents of her luggage had been replaced by airline paraphernalia\nAnd all American did when she called the complain about it was asking to fill out a form\nWell turns out ms nodded grab the wrong suitcase\nShe had taken the one filled with airline barely but it wasn't her she apologized Americanized following tweet so it's good news we can all fly American again\nThat clearly nothing like John ...\nReally good example is getting on social media in my opinion way too fast because her tweets were really strong dice fly the airline here's why and a thousand dollars worth of season airs are gone well if I had a thousand dollars for a season airs they'd be in my carry on not high tech\nAnd by the way I Would say this or they listen to Delano great hotel down there on South Beach saw white folks to run their furniture drapes walls everything but I cannot imagine that they are real happy to have her name associated with it is a shame multiple nasty tweets to exactly so heart only some photos\n... whereabouts where only actually since there were two only halfway through today struggle get together\nAnd said how Halloween is on Wednesday as we begin this hour with a broadcast we have a guest who's going to help us determine what is the popular candy across the country so that should be fun spending ... billion dollar industry so uh we'll check that out I Samir lifted the rundown we're going to get raped ...\nIraq coming up and just a few minutes for a personal connection segment today Chris my dad will be here to share a little bit about his position is chief information officer at the St Regis deer valley\nAnd how he managed to climb mount Kilimanjaro despite losing the use of his legs from skiing accident in college Scott McCartney of the wall Street Journal check thing for segment three to share his experiences imports aboard the world's longest flight on Singapore Airlines and we talked about I'm just about two weeks ago\nWell answer some emails later this hour and then we will get to deals of the week as well you know we wrap\nOkay so we'll do that so it was just said Wednesday is Halloween and candy sales right now they're happening everywhere as we speak if you've ever traveled around the country you're probably enjoy something sweet that's special to that\nParticular area of the nation Tom Johnson is with candy store dot com so clearly is a great job and he's joining us right now to share the popular candy for Halloween around the U.S Tom I Am I right but you have a great job I'm guessing you either have a ton of friends who get the candy with you or it may be no friends as they're all envious\n[laughter] uh you know you're right I have a fantastic job you know who worked for ... John Candy or across the country so it's a blast\nTo come into work in a day or and it it just you know you get hit with a blast of sugar air so it's kind of cool\nRight so times since we only had a few mass media today let's say sort of divide the country section since we asked listeners all over the U.S why don't we start with what's America's favorite Halloween candy on the west coast and maybe a few from the south west and the mountain states\nLook at him I'm Still in the west coast it there's not really sort of a west coast consensus it's um it's it's a little bit divided state by state Skittles or the big one in California\nUm and that's made because it's the most populous state out there I'm In his head north to Oregon he reaches cubs Washington the salt water Cassie um the candy corn and do well in Idaho in Nevada and that's kind of a trend that's been a little bit controversial across the country or even in New Mexico there's\nUm candy corn is number one can salvage
