sending the least twelve suspicious packages\nContaining what appears to be pipe bombs to high level Democrats and critics of President Trump but again law enforcement sources are confirming that

would do they got it and nobody got hurt you don't want to go to the one of the big uh one of the big points of speculation has been why haven't any of these ... didn't ... why did any of them
