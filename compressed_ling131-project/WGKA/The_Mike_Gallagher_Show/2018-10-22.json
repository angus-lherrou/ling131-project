you really ought to go try real effective outcome Nineteen Ninety five is a three week started pack relief factor dot com I'm joined now\nBy John Russia or Josh you can hear my voice is shot\nBut I got one question for you I think the wind is if the Republicans back and my right\nOr you know I I I think they've gotten a boost in our last month and it's\nGiven them the opportunity to pick up a few Senate seats or expand our dirty which to be\nAwfully important in the long term I could actually give the Senate as a sort of a bulwark against possible democratic gains elsewhere and how you know I think the field for Democrats that has gotten a lower but I still think the pathway to foresee had to pick it up as twenty four seats that are majority\nI think that as realistic as it was a few weeks ago so I think the house that we were like a narrow majority for the Democrats most likely MSN and I've already the ... the pickup for the Republican with all that\nStuff you know I think I'm more optimistic in the Senate because of trends but uh the house I Can't call anymore I used to say it was going to go democratic but the combination and I I Will lay it out the cabinet bumped combined with the assault on Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell and Nancy Pelosi combined with this caravan\nHave all sorts of solidified the issue set\nIn a very MB unemployment numbers and the earnings reports they've all come in for the Republicans at the end here uh Josh and voters notice\nSo here but they get somebody to NBC Wall Street Journal poll that we all look at very closely Democrats had a pretty good favorability rating the party images pretty solid a month ago\nIt's now at negative nine which is even lower than the Republican Party image which is pretty remarkable I think you're right that attributable to the cabin their their their their tactics off Kavanaugh\nAt some of the more radical elements of the party kind of show their face for the last month I also think that it's pretty remarkable that Republicans have employed vantage which party is better equipped to handle the economy at the largest advantage for any already in the history of the NBC Wall Street Journal poll so that'll be the economy is really the driving force in this election\nBut it definitely has given tropical birds and it's definitely give her a little bit of wind up you know a little bit of momentum for a Republican\nAnd let me ask you Peggy Noonan wrote this weekend that one of the great advantages of the Republicans have is the media is so obviously hating on Donald Trump and that there's a recoil in the public at large when they see a twenty four seven media against one party agree or disagree\n[noise] no I I think that showed itself in like having hearings like have you know when the when the media was bringing up questions about whether he was drunk and college and kind of we're kind of very salacious\nAnd I think that I I totally I was actually just in California reporting on all over the rational racism Southern California and that was all I mean I was surprised to hear from some sort of independent minded voters have have some evidence on how the Democrats and even the press coverage of the cabinet out here but look I think I think people are so polarized you that\nYou know ... ... you know they don't trust that anything they hear a they really\nHaven't gotten to their battles stations that just got to look for the partisan rhetoric out there so I don't think a whole there's a there's a whole lot of truck\nA of the Democratic side towards President Trump they don't believe anything he says I think a lot of Republicans don't trust what they ... the\nLast question my friend Mimi Walters who's a very influential in rising star in a very effective

on a plan\nAnd you've been grade Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot com studio Mike yeah like\n[noise] I sound\nA little peculiar but I always look for signs for there's something as important as a midterm election coming along I always looked for some sign and I went through this twenty sixteen and I remember very distinctly what happened I was looking for a sign that\nTrump was going to win\nAnd it was a if you remember no one gave him a chance I mean it was really silly how what was it Ninety two percent was the likelihood that Hillary was going to win a court in New York Times and I kept looking for a sign\nI kept saying something's going to come along right before the election but it's going to give me hope but\nHe's got a chance of winning the other words somebody's going to know something that we don't know and if you listen to my show in twenty sixteen you remember what it was\nThere was a little blurb and the New York post\nThat reported that Hillary Clinton who was going to have her big victory celebration at the Javits convention center because if it's big glass ceiling you know a woman breaking through the glass ceiling and be elected president of the United states and all of that she had a fireworks display plant and\nThey were going to shoot off fireworks along the Hudson River after she claimed her inevitable victory and a couple of days before the election there was a little blurb for the New York post\nThat\n\nExplains that the Hillary campaign had quietly pulled the permits for the fireworks display and cancelled the fireworks display and I read\nThat to you on the air I remember saying to you I think this is a sign I'm telling you this is a good sign they know something they know how silly it is to order hundreds of thousands of dollars maybe millions of dollars worth of fireworks and she could lose\nThe Hillary campaign know knew she could lose and of course we all know she did here's my little fireworks story two weeks before the midterm election President Trump's approval rating\nAccording to a brand new NBC Wall Street Journal poll is out it's the highest level that he's ever had in this poll\nIt's forty seven percent\nAnd there is a very intriguing aspect to that number President Trump's approval rating before the midterm elections\nIs now officially at a higher level then former President Obama's was ahead of his twenty ten mid term elections in other words\nPresident Trump is now more popular according to a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll than all the bronco bomber was at the exact same time of both of their president Xi's\nLet that sink in let that sink in\nI'm going to do something very similar to twenty sixteen because frankly\nThere's a lot of objects that are the same there's a lot of the same things at stake this is a crucial election\nWe must hold the house we must hold the Senate and as we see this onslaught of thousands and thousands of migrants crashing through border fences and\nEntering Mexico and threatening to invade the United states as we see this happening unfolding before our very eyes\nI like our chances as we somehow saw Brett Kavanaugh I'd get confirmed I like our chance\nAs we see people yelling at a leader McConnell in a restaurant in lieu of all a guy screaming at him and disrupting his meal I like our chances\nAs the media goes all in for the Democrats\nThe way they always do big race in Texas Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz you got to hear this ABC reporter here's an ABC reporter\nThis

the eighty percent of Americans think drug prices on reasonably high the American people believe drug makers are putting profits they had to patients\nDo you know Americans spend forty percent more on prescription drugs the Canadians and that our medication and prescription drug costs just keep sky rocketing farmers spent more money on lobby than any other industry and America over a hundred and Seventy one million dollars worth the American people believe that the system is rigged\nAnd it's rigged because of the big drug makers undue influence with their lobbying dollars\nYou know the fact of the matter is the monopoly pricing power of the drug makers can only be countered by action in Congress drug makers have to be held accountable there needs to be accountability but the skyrocketing costs of drug up our medications\nAmericans want accountability drug pricing and we want Congress to take action\nThe prevailing sentiment do we see in all the polls is enough is enough is enough already Americans want these solutions to prescription drug affordability and want them now it's time to hold the drug makers accountable put the patients ahead of profits\nThey have their lobbyists\nAnd there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories in our votes\nIt's time to end the drug makers monopoly pricing power and stop them from overcharging the American people it's time once and for all to put patients I had a profit we will be telling you how to do that in the days and weeks to come you're going to be very impressed with this partnership

was a blip\nOn the radar for the mainstream media are you kidding me the only people that were covered been guys were were conservative media outlets that uh\nThat bothered or dared to go up against

in the world no not even not even a little bit no comparison no comparison whatsoever hundreds of polling numbers though and I I Want to go back to the story about this is really interesting analysis from of all places CNN [noise] this is\nAn analyst or analysis rather from a CNN reporter the house for cast as the ... the Democrats win two hundred and twenty six seats\nAnd the house majority Republicans will only when two hundred nine seats the forecast percentage and this is CNN talking now [laughter] although we haven't generally presented a percent probability the model that we have showing that\nDemocrats hold the house I mean take over the house\nIs about Seventy two percent chance\nSo Harry and to know rigid and says it's not as if all hope his last Republicans indeed I Would point out that it's important to watch the margin of error it's still gives Republicans a decent chance of maintaining control again remembering that the model\nGives Democrats about Seventy two percent chance of winning control the house that's among the lower chances than most models do but it's in the general ballpark he asks\nDo you know who else had about a Seventy two percent chance of winning\nYou guessed it Hillary in twenty sixteen\nHe says it's not too difficult to paint a scenario in which the Republicans maintain control of the house\nMaintain control the house rather let's say Republicans with all the seats where they are favored as well as the streets were democratic candidates lead by about a point or less in the CNN forecast that would leave Republicans with two hundred and twenty streets\nTo Democrats with two hundred and Fifteen seats\nSo to ... to rule out to say that there is no no chance in hell that Republicans can control the house so it's not really
