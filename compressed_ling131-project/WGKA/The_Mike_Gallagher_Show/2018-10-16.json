Nineteen Seventy eight Gallagher has been a voice of clarity for millions of America\nDoes oh\nWe'll just leave him a credit card even if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house hands or is that what is the start of\nOur show known about the most famous man on a plan\nAnd you've been great Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here\nVery quickly now from the relief factor dot com studios Mike yeah like\n[noise] I Believe he is best efforts there has been a lot of victory for the Republicans over the last couple of weeks it's sort of started\nWith the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh despite every effort to stop him to for him to derail his confirmation it happened it happened and people were just to me\nAnd then of course there have been a lot of economic ... bits of news that keep coming out about the economy is we had a couple of we had a dip and the Dow for a couple of days it bounced back\nThe economy continues to search and shore and they're being political victories um yesterday a judge\nThrew out Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit against President Trump and had to do with one of his tweets and more and more importantly the judge ordered Stormy Daniels\nYou know the porn lawyer represented by Michael ... to pay President Trump's legal fees are real slap in the face um\nAnd then came this weird revelation by Senator Elizabeth Warren bet she barely has any Native American ancestry in her heritage\nWhich of course has that President Trump into this cascading you know euphoria of marketing and taunting her even more than ever\nTurns out she's got one\nOne thousand and twenty fourth Native American ancestry in her in her blood line and most Americans have more Native American ancestry been she does\nIt's been a con it's been a scam and she has thoroughly embarrassed herself and everybody's used to be having a field day with it well all of these things if you add them up\nIts you know all roads lead to November six we keep getting closer and closer to a midterm election with victory after victory after victory for Republicans but I don't know what's gonna happen I don't I don't I have absolutely no crystal ball\nWe should know not to try to make a prediction there are lots of toss ups in the house races\nAnd uh we we should have learned we should have learned from September from November of twenty sixteen not to believe the polls we should learn not to\n... and and when I see these this binary choice that is before Americans\nAnd a party represented by people like Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal I put them both to get this is this is a a lie that they've perpetuated in order to impress people\nIn the ... warns case it was to get advancement at Harvard by calling herself a Native American and Richard Blumenthal case it was doing press people as well as as if he was some kind of a war hero\nIt's called stolen valor when you lie about serving your country now again this is represented by the Democratic party\n\nIt this is a party that is angry and violent I was reading about Tucker Carlson who uh we hope to have on the show next week I enjoy your show\nJust about every night I don't know Tucker in fact all the years I've spent as a Fox News contributor bypass never I've never really cross paths with Tucker um\nHe's got a new book that's number one on the New York times best seller lists\nAnd he said in a in an interview he gave to the national review podcast this week but so many people curse him out in public when he goes out to dine in restaurants\nBut he can't go out to eat anymore he doesn't go to restaurants\nHe told the national review pod cast having someone scream F you at a restaurant it just ... your ... your meal he says he can't go to restaurants anymore in Washington DC but Zeke because he continually get yelled at\nBy other diners who shout curse words at him stuff those are Democrats\nThat's the way Democrats are at the end when I looked at a race like the one between ... work in Texas are actually Robert ... in Texas and Ted Cruz\nYou you gotta you gotta guy on a skateboard versus a grown up a constitutional conservative just cannot be a tough call protects\nAnd your story after story north south east and west where the choice is so easy it's not even the shouldn't even be a close call\nNow the deck is stacked against the Republican Party because in off year elections but party in control usually suffers a defeat I don't think that's going to happen this year I just don't I think we're going to see some good good news\nAnd [laughter] the realism with one thing cannot help\nI just I just want to be able to salute in a variety of ways with some musical tribute ... real Native Americans like ... junior I Want you to hear what he said uh representing Cherokee Nation he was on CNN last night with Jake Tapper\nAnd you know\nPocahontas is now bragging about this weird revelation that she has one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American\nHeritage and shot task and junior pushback last night from Cherokee Nation in a big way here's a clip ... number three from CNN and our friends over at grey being\nThe problem with in a in a test is that it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation and member of an Indian nation\nDNA at best can give you some indicators of some markers of that to indicate that you're related to somebody who live long ago that may have lived there in North and South America and they have been a native peoples of those continents um\nIt's irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American in this country that that the base that's based on legal definition certainly every tribe has that in common that we have some legal basis for citizenship that we determine consistent with federal trainees\nHis holy unhelpful or for any national later to a claim to be in a ten determine ah or tennis tablets that their Native American in this country\nThis is this is all good news for Republicans because we are just a couple of weeks away from the mid term election the president wasted no time in responded in responding or very forcefully here are some of his tweets\nHe said poke a hunter or they I mean the tweets are classic you know they call the limousine that the president rides in that big\nStretch Cadillac limousine the nickname for it as the beast\n... nickname for Donald Trump ought to be the beach because these tweets the man is just but he's an animal I mean it's just hysterical here has reached today thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas\nIs a complete and total fraud many tweeted now that her claims are being of Indian heritage urban have turned out to be a scam an ally Elizabeth Warren's should apologize for ... for ... for perpetrating this fraud against the American people\nHarvard called her a person of color\nAmazing con he puts in parentheses and would not have taken her otherwise and then he tweeted Pocahontas the bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slam\nShe took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth far less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her quote DNA test is useless even they don't want\nHer phony [noise]\nElizabeth Warren
