his reputation was injured yes he is a justice of the United States Supreme court\nHe will have twenty five thirty thirty five years God willing to write opinions that will be his legacy but church on whom you've studied your entire life often was assailed by criticisms some fair mostly unfair how did he deal with that Larry art\nWell he uh this is a ah\nThis this will be a controversial point with people probably but we've changed the libel and slander law is in America as they have not done in England and he would sue people if they said things that were not true oh when when\nI did not know he was led to just well not you know huge amount but uh like a fellow ah\nThere's lord Alfred Douglas and there's a there's another guy wrote a book and you know accused him said that when he was ... sentence was he stole and he was beat\nInternational made him take that back you know it's like having a cat a parallel to Kevin alright yeah he's he wrote a book you wrote in a favorable book about

nobody has a right to that right but your point is his personal reputation has been hard exactly and he will ever after the the person who\nYou know was accused of the things right and they'll never be the resolution of it and that means his children will be on the inside but how better if he chose to do it for them to be able to say they had to retract that because that wasn't true\nThere is
