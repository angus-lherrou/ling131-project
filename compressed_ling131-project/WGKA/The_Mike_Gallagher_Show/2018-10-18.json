D now\nLive from the AM nine twenty the answer studios in buck head it's fifty three degrees\nThe Hugh Hewitt show brought to you by the outlook on line huge savings on the items you need and want it's a big deal the outlet online John\nBack American I'm In Tampa [noise]\nYour your air thank you for listening today I think it's useful for me to introduce you to new emerging voices every now and then one of them is Scott Galloway\nYou heard earlier on this show this week Alan Greenspan emerged to talk about the wonders of Amazon and out is creative destruction\nPersonified well Scott Galloway does not agree with that he is the author of before\nMost recently eight forty five minute talk on the future of retail but Savage to Amazon I always tell people I own Amazon I Love what it's doing for me as a financial matter but I Am worried about big tech Rob Galloway welcome Scott welcome to the program um what do you make a Twitter controversy involving Louis Farrakhan as a way into this\nAh thank you I'm ... and nice to be with you as so I think it's a it with respect to Twitter and Google or I Believe these companies have warmly embrace a the the margin the celebrity and the influence of media companies but they seem to be allergic to the responsibilities\nOf the fourth estate and I think that most of these examples\nAre essentially demonstrate one thing and that these companies um don't want don't want to acknowledge that they're not platforms that immediate firms and that they are responsible for their content and the responsible for ensuring that these platforms aren't paying weaponized so\nI'm generally on the side\nOf of of thinking okay we need we need to hold these companies are the same standards detailed other media companies do for decades or or even centuries now\nI I spent much of my MSNBC show talking about the need to regulate\nA Silicon Valley and its bags that I read in the New York post your quote I Believe our society is effectively going through this very uncomfortable transition that has bad very bad for America bad for the planet\nWhere we no longer worship at the altar of character and kindness we worship at the altar of innovators and billionaires and I said a man and we've got to do something uh this is sort of like the age of the railroad billionaires as it is an age\nOf tech titans your effectively uncontrolled and Franklin forest book world without mine scared me and now you're preaching but I don't know what to do do you have a proposal what to do\nI I don't think the world is what it is I think is what we make of it and I think initially I think we need to America I have some proud history of when a company turns into an invasive species and starts killing small companies and the Caribbean prematurely euthanize a big companies that are better taxpayers and better employers we move in\nAnd we break them up it doesn't mean they're evil that doesn't mean the bad people it doesn't mean they haven't we haven't benefitted from them or we haven't been net gain or people at ma bell weren't you've all the people the railroads were evil but when we have one company Amazon but until it's fifty percent\nOf all the commerce when we have one company the controls Ninety three percent of whatever content you see after you declare your intention is search and that's Google\nWhen we have one company or that is responsible for eighty percent of time in ... where we spend eighty percent of our time and found on I found that Facebook it is time to move in and break these guys that competition is the answer to I'm actually not a regulation guy and regulation has unintended consequences\nBut it is trying to oxygen marketplace issue we need voices like you come to the light we need these companies\nBroken up and we need to do aside with macho initially people have sort of a gag reflects that if you talk about breaking these guys up it makes you somehow a socialist or worse European uh it is very Americans and moving on big companies when they become an invasive species and we are at that point market\nAnd we were they are they are information trusts now and and and trust busters are needed I Am particularly appalled that Google is selling the instruments Wichita altering control to China\nAnd I don't think people understand that would be like selling weapons design that the crop iron works in in Nineteen thirty three it is it is really a remarkable access John Bolton told me last week he thinks we need to go to export control but maybe break up would do it although it wouldn't stop that Scott Galloway\nI'm not sure that it wasn't so in the case of Facebook you literally had the G argue weaponized the object of our affection Facebooking that make this this weapon in our face and\nI mean the the flags here we are not only rag read they were they were you know ... ... is Russia pitcher these ads trying to reach African our society with rubles\nAnd Facebook decided to ignore it and didn't wanna didn't want to understand it just as\nJust as the tobacco companies had a difficult time connecting tobacco with cancer social media is gonna have a difficult time connecting unfettered content and not spinning advertisers with bad things I think if you broke up Facebook into for companies\nFacebook what's happening around the messenger\nOne or more of them would decide that to appeal to advertisers because there was greater competition they would make requisite investments to ensure their platform would not be weaponized by bad actors there's a lot of advertisers who are\nCivic minded and would like to not advertise on Facebook but right now they don't have any choice because it's a ... will go on Facebook command two thirds of all digital marketing so competition is absolutely the answer\n[laughter] a man's got Galloway where do people find out more about it obviously they can buy your book that for about ... to run a website as well\nBreaking news at breakneck pace is so Mike Gallagher show\nWe're not going to make America great again it was never that story\nWe [laughter] we've got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ... Nineteen Seventy eight to ... voice so clarity for millions of Americans\nGo low we came up\nWith this new Democratic Party if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house doors sparkling millet is

studios might yell at\nYou [noise]\nI really have this great relationship with my friends and colleagues here at the Salem Radio network I give you a hard time\nAnd I think you always looks at me a little warily because you and I have not always agree about the uh the trajectory of Donald Trump shall we say who was not early on board he really has come around he likes as he calls balls and strikes\nBut one thing he said the last time we were on stage together somewhere\nIs that there is no deep state [laughter] well there's no deep state and I said how can you say that would mean there's no deep state now there's no deep state\nAnd I said was do I think you'd look sick or let's take a survey of the audience and see what they think\nAnd\nAt the end of the day the audience of course started booing I said now Hugh they're not saying that you do so first thing I'm going to stay the night\nTo buy a dear friend of yours us here in Tampa were broadcasting from the studios of the AM eight sixty the answer and beautiful Tampa, Florida for a bigger veteran either strategy center I'm going to say hey you forward Natalie Mayflower sours Edwards\nTheir their their forwards that

grammatical ... arrest\nThat happened late Tuesday came on the heels of other high profile leak related prosecution under the Trump Administration there's just cracks me up you know it's it fascinates me that stuff is so\nPainfully obvious and yet even great mark why is people like you can't be stubborn and not let facts in the way of\nAn opinion I don't know we got a lot to cover today we want to

all the long course there's a deep state of course there are people from within who are trying to stop this president covered shaving his goals of course there's a deep state there should be no doubt there's a deep state\nHow do you not understand that\nMeanwhile as we get closer to the midterm elections the Democrats seem to be getting crazier\nAnd more violent I saw Lindsey Graham last night on TV said he was spat upon the scary ball but he's never had to have Capitol police security\nI saw a video of of a guy ripping up Ted Cruz pictures in fact we've got that video\nI'm opposed to here in a bit I'm going to play it for you\nBecause as you'll hear the guys say he lives in uh Houston suburb but guy literally sounds like a demon\nHe sounds possess he turns on the guy filming him and stretch rallied about how much she hates Ted Cruz shedding Heidi crews of course recently changed at a restaurant in Washington DC\nThis kinda stuff amazes me because nothing's going right for the Democrats and you know what worries me you're going to hear that you're going to stay home because the guy and he was okay but worries the heck out of me\nThis guy goes around ripping up Ted Cruz a campaign signs Democrats are doing that a lot these days they're ripping up ... they're taking down and they're stealing campaigns on their assaulting Republicans who assaulted Minnesota\nLindsey Graham spat upon people being chased out of restaurants they're losing it and as they lose it it makes me think they're afraid they're gonna lose on November\nGosh I've drawn a blank for six ... six

stream if you want to watch this guy turned to the camera and looked like he is demonic possession I'm not really\nBut here's my worry number first of all let me give you to take away is that what yours number one the Democrats are really afraid they are about to lose\nOn November ... they're starting to really panic that they're going to lose number two\nWe're going to get complacent because we see that all these bad things are happening to the Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota\nWith the stupid political ad that identified sexual abuse victims people who didn't want to be identified and now one of them at least as in fear for her life because she's afraid her attacker is going to come back an attacker again thanks to Heidi Heitkamp\nThis is the Senate Democrat who is going to vote yes for Brett Kavanaugh until she turned the sound off and saw his testimony and just looked at his facial expressions and decided to vote no just because of that\nI mean we're in crazy bill and I'm just afraid of Americans are going to hear all this time stay at home 'cause we got this we don't got this you got to vote in November ... has to come out and vote you gotta move heaven and earth to vote or we're going to lose your show up we when\nIt's going to kill me if we lose the house on November ... and on the November seven\nWere reading turnout numbers and we ... we didn't turn out the way we
