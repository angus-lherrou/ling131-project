I I'm thinking about people being held to restaurants and shouted down and\nHillary saying there can be no civility until we the Democrats when she said until we win in November we never act that way we never do that to other people we never we would never do that and we wouldn't accept it there is a stark difference between the way people on the right and and in fact\nMany independents react and the way these activists\nI'm ... and ... the the fact is the lack of denunciation by Democrat leaders or\nThe lack of condemnation over some of this egregious behavior it's a it's a it's a powerful and type it on the Democratic party of twenty Eighteen\nIt is very revealing and certainly to the degree that we can dramatize that and make them pay a price on the ballot box we showed but I Would go beyond that and say that if they got getting even more out of hand\nWhich I think it's quite likely I'll put ... the Democrats don't win the house Republican told the house in the Senate and then we're on the twenty twenty um I I don't expect it to get worse and I think what it means is that on certain campaign particularly the group like Berkeley\nDropped back to end up spending and the national guard a hand\nAnd I think Republicans ordinarily would find that strange shouldn't because protecting people First Amendment rights I mean what could be more fundamental then that\nWas the name of death of the nation and I am so proud to make sure everybody knows the way to see the movie it's streaming it's going to be out on DVD but you can get it now do you go to the death of the nation movie dot com not since Eighteen sixty\nHave the Democrats so fanatical he refused to accept a free election and leave it to the national issues or\nTo connect the dots as you have done so many times my friend and I'm so happy to have you back on the show to remind everybody about the way they can go to death of the nation movie dot com get the movie congratulations on yet another success\nLet's leave with your gut feeling about November the ...

shattering about Trump calling porn star Stormy Daniels horse base the economy just\nKeeps blooming uh and uh the world\nThe world is noticing and the culture a couple of interesting things I started my day with a knock down drag out argument with a dear friend of mine and it's okay I mean Mark Davis and I I'm\nNot don't always agree a hundred percent we definitely don't agree on this one has to do with something in the culture to culture pieces of to culture stories I Want to share with you I watch the counters last night the reason I watched it because\nI'm a lot of people didn't watch it I don't know if the ratings are out yet Lance can you check the overnight and see what the news is about ABC's re boot of the Roseanne show\nUh they they fired her for her tweet about\nValerie Jarrett I wasn't going to watch and then I read somewhere that she didn't want anything bad to happen to the show because she wanted her friends and the people she had worked with for many years to be okay so it wasn't like Roseanne herself was calling for any kind of a boycott of the show and I was interested to see how it how it was actually it was very good\nIt was Roseanne without Roseanne\nBut it was the same vibe it was it was really a good good episode\nAnd it dealt with the fictional death of Roseanne Connors the character died of an opioid overdose or she died of a prescription medication overdose which is a very real\nStory line for many people in this great country of ours\nAnd I happened to be a big fan of Laurie Metcalf the character actress who plays your sister Jackie\n... played by John Goodman I I think he's a tremendous character actor and they put they put out very very powerful performances\nAnd you know we're going to see how it plays out uh again I watched it only because I didn't think that it was um something that she she wanted to show to to succeed even though she's obviously very upset\nAbout being fired and\nFor good cause one tweet\nHave you heard Bill Maher lately ... what about Cathy Griffin you go down the list of people who say the most horrific things about conservatives about Christians about Donald Trump about Republicans that's all fine\nRoseanne one offensive tweet and she's done\nNow what's interesting is and I got the argument on tape we're gonna play a little bit of it I don't think Marco mind because there's the movie first man and I'm going to revisit the controversial only because\nI find it kind of interesting as we lead up to ... at the bottom of the hour I Want to play for you the argument that mark and I had mark loves the movie because mark is Mr space man he loves everything to do with NASA and space which is great I mean I Do too [noise]\nBut I'm not going to see a movie that doesn't do pick Neil Armstrong planting the flag on the surface of the moon and somehow people have called that a manufactured controversy including my dear friend Mark Davis the morning host on six sixty am the answer so I'm going
