this Democrat play ball\nDemocrats aren't saying anything because they want these people and so they can stay in power because they're assuming these refugees are going to vote for them\nA couple years ago these Democrats while for the wall\nNow all of a sudden because Trump is saying they're quiet no no no we need this wall and the American people want this wall if you let the people and put them in detention centers and so you can talk more\nWell those detention centers are full of that though there's too poor to point problem they're number one the detention centers are full from the last year a band\nAnd number two you saw what happened they got federal judges to say you can't separate children from from adults in terms of their detention centers and if you have them together as a family you can only keep them there for X number of days before you have to turn them loose end of the population and us\nYou know we're turning thousands and thousands of people are\nA loose end of

to that and do the asylum claim that even if they do get held in a detention center it'll be a temporary stay then they're going to get ... you know released into the population an added to those numbers so\nAh the wall as a part of the solution but it is not the only solution and ah\nAnd I don't know what the answer is other than what our Jane Harman set in that bring our lawmakers back close the loop holes changed the wording of the fear of persecution or asylum claims that we allow in this country and really\nAnd also add that third you know third nation or a element to this is well if

come up come at this from my little direct little different direction from one of the applications are the results that will happen if the if Trump America start smoking things on their own interests it will be seen and the rest of the world\nIn a positive way and for instance my wife and I support an orphanage in Kenya ends missionaries in Kenya for one of the things they've got to do is focus on

under the people developing for themselves\nYeah it's a good are open and it's a it's a thoughtful response I mean I Want to go a little bit more to the core of accusing somebody who calls him or herself a nationalist a racist or an anti Semite\nDoug do you think Don Lemon really believes that forest adjusted attempt to to to attack\nAnd and tear down the president at any expense [noise]\nOh yeah I mean absolutely it's an attempt to tearing down because he doesn't realize the implication of what are you saying\nWe're we're going to sound like you're talking about John Lennon yeah right and it\nJust trying to take us away from some are focusing on America's needs and focusing on other people's needs exactly\nI mean you and and you look at what Germany therefore not focusing on their

Navy Airforce Marines are they a bunch of national is because they they fight for and defend the United states they're not fighting for Belgium\nThey're not worried about France or they nationalist she ... you know ... and again very very thoughtful reaction to what he went to the very thoughtless or remarks by Don Lemon she doesn't believe that there's no way that a guy on national television I don't care how biased she is\nBelieved that if you say you're a nationalist you must be a racist\nIt's an attempt you know the old drill the left uses ... you're a racist it's a little bit like you know wait what did you start feeding your wife\nOh you're a racist that is a racist thing to say\nThat's got anti Semitic overtones you know the all right the Proud Boys all these different groups they they they they gravitate to white nationalism white national that's what Don lemons do it he's completely nationalism or being a nationalist\nWith white nationalism and then before you know what you're into the all right you're into that white supremacy your your than you than you then you're more than to neo Nazis skinheads\nIt's a game he plays pits a game desperate people play when they're

behind them\nDo you see a lot of little old ladies do see a whole bunch of little children\nTo see a bunch of women for that matter I see a bunch of able bodied young men\nAnd then of course is what the president was referring to when he talked about the makeup of these migrants who are marching towards our southern border the president weighed in on it last night at a huge rally at the Toyotas center in Houston you watched it on TV and it was it was it was something to watch\nIt's almost as if\nEverything is coming together as once again another perfect storm to let Republicans

clip number six courtesy of Fox News and gravy and what's happening\nAs a large group of people they caught a caravan\nBut this man [noise] I think the Democrats had something to do and I think we made a mistake or seeing how bad it is how it is\nA\nMistake so think of\nIs an assault on our couch [noise]\n\nCaravan you'll have some very bad\nYou know the president says that and the media

the big bunch allies\nThat's a news reporter this is not an object and this is not a pundit she's not a Mike Gallagher type or Sean Hannity or you know Tucker Carlson died she was a reporter\nAnd we'll find this report I'll play it for you to give you an example of media bias in the report about the caravan not one word in the report not one single word about\nThe concerns the fears the anxious miss that Americans have about these migrants all it was about was the give us your poor your tired your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\nHere's the reporter helped me to carry a de hydrated woman over to get some water oh and helping her I'm I'm stepping away from the makeup table so I can go carry her to get some water I mean it it's unbelievable the media bias is incredible\nAnd you know who calls out the media and refers the Trump as the Godzilla of politics there's an article in in in the u._k. daily mirror\nBy Piers Morgan is so strong I got to read it to your word for word it's not long but you got to absorb it you've got to hear these words you gotta you gotta soak it in cars Piers Morgan is so right about\nThe attacks making Donald Trump as a

I Wish to have a hard time of that word and by sticking their collective heads in the sand\nThe the Morgan is referring to the poll that came out this week the show's Trump at a forty seven percent approval rating according to the NBC Wall Street Journal poll forty seven percent\nObama was at forty five percent at the same exact stage of his presidency right before the midterms up twenty ten show Trump is accorded NBC\nMore popular than Obama was at this time in Obama's presidency how can this be happening they will whale uncontrollably writes Piers Morgan\nWhat the blank is wrong with people who like him they will how do each other's kale salads\nEspecially the end of planet earth they will sob in their normal understated manner\n[laughter] all of which will be music to the years of Trump a man who absolutely rebels and liberal hysteria because he knows it works for him there's this new poll proves the more Trump bashore scream abuse at at about him the more fires up his base and indeed the more fires up Trump himself after all at its heart\nThe president's a street fighting New Yorker who loves a good scrap\nAnd into each time writes Morgan he may delivered the biggest knockout punch up his presidency until recently it was widely assumed the Republicans would lose control of the house in the mid term elections\nIt was being depicted as a damning referendum on Trump and historically most presidents like Obama take a whack in the midterms but now he says I'm not so sure in fact I'd say there's a very good chance the Republicans will hang on to the house as well as the Senate and Trump will move on empowered at emboldened\nSo what could very well be an even bigger win and twenty twenty why is this happening he says\nWell first the U.S mainstream media has become the boy who cried wolf they're constantly collective outrage over every tiny thing Trump says tweets or does much of a driven by commercial self interest has had the inevitable effective diluting the impact of that\nOutrage barely a week goes by without some supposedly new Trump crisis fueling wall to wall cable news coverage\nThan dire predictions of impeachment or even jail time for Trump yeah within a few days each administrators shouldn't threatening scandal quote unquote\nDissolves into a giant nothing Burke\nHe says I look at Democrats today and I see a party that's learn absolutely nothing about how to beat Donald Trump and I see a president who's going stronger by the\nDay Trump has become a political Godzilla crushing everyone who dares challenge him and bulldoze his way through an agenda that is beginning to pay real dividends then it goes on to list all the accomplishments\nThe tax cuts the regulations the economy North Korea trade war with China\nTrends pursue a big part all the things and he's clamp down hard on illegal immigration\nPiers Morgan says as I write this caravan of thousands of Central American migrants most of them from Honduras is moving toward the southern border they intend to try to enter the U.S illegally\nIt's hard to think of a more powerful image to vindicate Trump's much criticized demand for a new wall isn't it\nAs he tweeted full aperture being made to stop the onslaught of the illegal aliens from crossing our southern border the caravans or a disgrace to the Democratic party changed the immigration laws now Morgan says\nHe's the president is beginning to really enjoy himself he's exuding an Arab someone who's worked out how Washington works or rather doesn't and how to play the broken highly partisan system to his advantage\nLove him or load him Piers Morgan writes in this terrific piece\nThere is no desire to deny that he's winning once again I can only advise the Democrats to stop their ridiculously self defeating state of perpetual Trump outrage and work out how they're actually going to beat him because right now he writes Trump is kicking your butt\nAnd he does not use the word but he uses another four letter words it's a great piece by Piers Morgan\nAnd wanted to share it with you here on the Mike Gallagher show want to remind you about our friends of the job creators network you and I know
