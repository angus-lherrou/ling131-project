{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "You're going to be in a lower tax bracket and that was the gospel according to every advisor in the eighties okay a lot of things have changed since then number one is um the fact that um we are experiencing a uh well we believe is going to be a a a coming season of tax increases\nIf you look at the fact that we have an eighty million baby boomers retiring\nEighty million that's like a fourth of our our population okay a retiring over the next few years they're going to become a ... I hate to use this phrase but they but they become takers in other words a set of producing\nWork in producing FICA taxes in him producing earned income they're going to be taking Medicare Social security they're going to be a utilizing other things that we can utilize and retirement\nOr one of those things I'm looking for is the senior discounted all these restaurants so I I'm looking forward to that but but besides that\nWe're going to have a lot of fewer people working versus the number number of people are retired also we expected the next twenty five years that instead of having three thousand people over the age of one hundred and ... a country we may have\nHundred thousands are they've even\nThey've even predicted three million people over the age one hundred and you can imagine the burden on Medicare and things like that at that age\nSo I'm going to be paid for it and secondly during the great recession of two thousand eight in the years following that in order to help us recover the government created a lot of programs where they printed a lot of money\nAnd so printing money causes a couple of things but one can cost future inflation and number two\nIt puts this further than the whole and if you've ever pulled up by little website called I think it's called debt clock dot org but I can just Google that it shows our current countries' debt and the bottom line is this route twenty two trillion and clicking a you know a dollar every every second on TALK\nAnd so twenty two trillion that we're in the hole\nAnd folks the only way to solve that is it takes to step step one cutting services a step to raising taxes that's the only way to combat that amount of money so if you're raising taxes and cutting services that means the more your tax bills higher tax rates higher\nAnd number two you're paying for more stuff than you were maybe higher deductible on your Medicare maybe a Social Security income has been cut or are they not not increasing it as much as they used or the cost of living or whatever it may be\nSo what you've got is ... is a perfect storm so you've got these eighty million people retiring they're being forced to take money out of there are ready to age seven and a half and we've got a higher tax bracket\nSo one of the things we do with every client that we work with is we discuss and typically come up with a tax strategy of ways we can create tax free buckets of money\nAnd so that is very important to do a rat now eighty five percent of your Social Security is taxable are up to eighty five percent I Believe that will be a one hundred percent in the coming years\nAnd again any pension money you receive any our a money you take you out for all three beef four one K. all of that money coming out is tax just like ordinary income so really if you're living right now I'm eighty thousand a year and you want to live on eighty thousand retirement and who doesn't want to live on what they used to living um\nThen you would think you'd be in the same tax bracket but again as taxes I think will go up over the coming ten years or so\nThen you will be in a higher tax bracket and by the way you will lose a lot of good deductions to maybe you pay off your house may be you know already we've lost some deductions with the current tax um\nUh changes uh and now you have to um have a greater amount of deductions Steven qualified picked adoptions and so um that the the chases again if you pay more in taxes are very real very high so\nThe answer the questions when my taxes go up or down in retirement I sincerely believe they'll go up and so you need a strategy you need to make sure that you're prepared for that\nUh and you really want to start before you retired but if you're close to retirement are retired it's not too late ah it's time to start movies the money around and getting some money tax free and we have some very a neat ways of converting money into tax free money that could have other benefits for you as well so keep that in mind\nAs you I'm again for your does your deciding you want to come in and chat with us and we'll be glad to talk about that as one of our subjects for the meeting um another one here\nOccasionally I'll have somebody come in and actually I have a client now that I'm working with and they have become very adept at managing their money they um I've got one client that has taken all these classes on options and\nAnd hedging and and and different different methods of managing money and he's done pretty well uh I don't know if he's been through a bear market\nBut with some of the things he's doing it he might not get bit too bad or or maybe he will leave and make money I don't know he made you know I've met people that we're doing great in a good market and how the knowledge and all the hedging and all the options and they really lost it and when the bear market hit\n'em but um some folks are are very good at that they spend a lot of hours a day studying it this guy gets up every morning spent an Irish you on the computer looking at some of the numbers and the graphs and and then by the by the time much time gets there he goes and looks again and make some final decisions and and things like that and so\nYou know most people don't want to spend that kind of time but he loves it and so that's fine so the question is would you still work with somebody like that and well actually I Do and that's I'm working with him\nUm the the question comes down to I have to make sure that we're in seek in other words the money he's managing does not need to be a critical part of his retirement plan\nUm so if we're if we're able to to manage yo yo Seventy percent of his a portfolio maybe eighty and he wants to manage twenty or thirty we could probably deal with that and Afghan every situation is different um but I still need to make sure he says misstatement every quarter I Need updated numbers every month\nBecause of his is losing money I Need to make sure that I Know that and can't plan accordingly on the rest of his retirement plan\nSo yes you can still manage some of your money but if you really want a true retirement road map we're going to need to use some tools that either don't require managing our aren't manageable by you here because we perhaps are brought in an active money manager a so we need um you know we'll need to be able to handle a good part of that\nBut don't ask me something to stop you from coming in and if you're if you do it yourself and you're like I'm is my money I'm going to keep managing it\nI've actually had folks have come in and have paid us a fee to write their retirement road map for them and then I sent them on their merry way they paid me a fee and they took off and then they went and implemented it that's fine to uh you know I'm sure you what we do\nYou tell me what you do and if you want to keep doing what you're doing that's fine the problem I find that a case like that is is\nUm you know the maybe the husband is doing all this trading and stuff and then suddenly something happens to him or maybe some memory loss maybe uh some some health issues maybe passes away\nOr or whatever or they start traveling a lot or something and and so things start slipping and or if he just passed away and now the wife is left and it's the same as his vice versa I write a but they're just left without\nKnowing what to do next they're not the expert at that and so even with that were good backup plan I think something like that but\nDon't let there be something that says well you know I mean it's my own stuff I'm gonna keep doing it well that's fine come in and and let's see if we can help you with the rest of it\nAnd then uh you know if it's a good decision for you to keep doing some of your own managing than a ... a share money you keep doing it but ah we'll have to work out kind of a a special situation to make sure again that you're getting the most bang for your buck that's always the most important thing\nOf the last question I don't know if I've ever technically got this question but I Wonder if people think about this\nEither when they listen to our show or they leave a meeting\nOr or something like that in what they think that I think they think is this is is um okay I like what markets and I like his method I Love the planning a he seems very trustworthy he's well known rented Atlanta for what he does he speaks a lot of places very knowledgeable he stays up on stuff\nBut you know it can really trust him to work with me one on one because if you're like me as I find something I really like and I get into it and I started using it I found out later that either I get passed off to somebody or you know maybe the doctor I hired and it turns out that that um you know I'll I only get to see the nurse practitioner nothing wrong with that but\nYou know in that case you got to see the doctor right so we're very personalized here we're boutique style of firms so we don't take her a lot of new clients are so if I take you own as the client you are my client and you're on my clients from now on or as long as you will have me as your advisor and retire a planner\nA so there's a bait and switch there's no hey I'm going to work with you for a week and then send you off to a junior advisor or whatever um if I work with you if I say I'm going to work with the I work with you and uh as far as you know trust and and and there's this guy do what he says he's going to do\nUm you know that's that's hard I mean I'm you know we have our licenses uh we hardly ever lose a client I'm a rare occasion and typically is because of a extenuating circumstance\nI'm sort of the reason for that so you know if you really need to hear from our clients uh we actually could put you in touch with our clients and the ones that have given permission you can actually talk to them and say hey\nIs this guy for real is this guy you know and my clients are very good to be very honest they'll they'll tell you you know what's real and they'll tell ya ya market does a great job and uh you can even asking what's the negative thing what's the the one bad thing or whatever and they may tell you something about that too I don't know but um uh that's probably the best way to find somebody is either referral\nOr or or talk to their clients and um I don't hide behind my clients I let them talk to you if you want him to so that might be helpful hit and if you're looking for an advisor first of all always make sure their produce Sherry the second let's see if we can talk to their clients and not just to\nOr in a rarity and I'm not saying has to be self serving you have to have had the chance to have heard me on the radio multiple times or listen to me talking here highlights flying things that's the benefit I have having radio shows for two decades as people know me that I don't know I don't know you but you know me sometimes\nI Know a lot of the audience but I don't know as many people in this audience as the audience feels they know me 'cause they listen to me talk about multiple issues that's a that's an anomaly that's an aside but if you're hiring someone in a different state that doesn't have a radio show and a bunch of audio and video content you can't know without interviewing a few different people\nAnd listening to opinions\nWhat what I Know is that when someone has talked a multiple agents and then they talk to me they immediately don't want to get off the phone\nWhen I'm One of the first agents they've talked to they want to move on and talk to other agents but then they get caught up in the sales ether that is our business I don't believe I'm In sales not with the people that higher is I Believe we're a consultancy an advocacy\nBecause the world has changed I made a phone call\nOr two mark done who is going to be on the show here in a bit talking about health insurance the other mortgage in your life new era health plans are playing rock dot com I called them to do the interview\nAnd we record the interviews usually so I I called them to do the interview and he didn't answer or I didn't call the right number but it was one of his sales numbers and I got the voice mail and I hung up and I I was about to call the other number my phone rang and I thought well this could be him it's not the same number let me just try 'cause it\nWas almost immediate and it was a return phone call and it was a automated message which was talking about open enrollment in health I was stunned\nI've had this happen in real estate I had a former high school classmate from high school or on Facebook message me one day and say I need to sell a house in the urban Georgia can you help me I said absolutely be glad to help you\nSell a house within minutes he was getting notifications from other real estate agents interested in helping him cell is home we're being spied on and we're being manipulated and I'm not saying that\nSome of our marketing doesn't take the tone of that sort of stuff but I don't know how it works I just subscribed to people and vendors who help us produce real buyers and sellers of things in real estate but the point of it is creepy that something on my phone spied on me and recognized I just call the number that\nSells health insurance that's what it was and most people\nFall for it because that's in their head right then they're answering the phone and they fall for it because it's the right moment at the right time and they never stopped to think is this a greedy egregious sales operation or a gender or whatever\nOr is it ... or is it legitimate and most of the time it's illegitimate because people just want to get it over with\nAs many of you know that listen to me on the radio I spent the better part of the last three years doing mostly media\nWith a a a sidebar of real estate\nUm I won't go through the whole story but some things happened in the media business this year because basically it's full of a bunch of idiots and fake news are liars and I decided to not participate in that any more because you can't make money when you have to lie to climb the ladder and to work with scum bags now in real estate you have to work with a lot of scum bags but you don't have to lie to make a lot of money\nYou simply don't have a lot you can tell the truth and you'll lose some deals but you'll gain as many are far more by telling the truth and you'll make a lot more money\nSo if I really want to make a difference the best thing I can do is help people buy and sell real estate and accomplish their financial goals so I decided to get out of the media business as a fulltime job\nAnd instead of just walking back into real estate business like every arrogant person in my business does I said you know let me assume I don't know anything and I'm starting from scratch again I've got Twenty years nearly experiences business I'd said let me figure out what really needs to happen to have\nThe kind of success in this phase of my career\nI call it phase three [noise]\nAnd I started interviewing people for a month I didn't do anything to make any money I didn't do anything that was the sales activities and making money I'm fortunate enough I didn't have to do that but I I basically sat down and I took sales pitches from anybody willing to give me a sales pitch or a demo of their product\nIn the process of doing that in thirty days I got an education that would have taken me two or three years to obtain I didn't rush through it I didn't have a gun to my head financially and I wasn't trying to prove or do anything quickly\nAnd when I got done with it I made some decisions about various technology vendors to re launch our company and what I Would call circuit twenty twenty or twenty Twenty one meaning it too well ahead of his time our technology is beyond what most Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of agents are companies in Atlanta half\nI'm convinced of it because I spent so much time focused on it made a couple of bad decisions I quickly annihilated those bad decisions by firing those companies terminating those contracts due to breach or non performance and moved on to companies that are exceptional\nWe're seeing showings on listings of the likes I've never seen before we're getting leads off of bliss things were selling our own list things while if things aren't selling we're producing double and triple in some cases the showings at other agents prior to that produced where they had expired and I I attribute it to some of our Web vendor\nDecisions and\nThe reason I'm able to produce that and proudly say that with truth being the backbone of it is the fact that I stopped and listened to all the sales people fail cell and I probably listen to a hundred different pitches throughout the course of April of this year to make a decision on eight or ten vendors\nI'm that's what home sellers don't do they don't listen\nThey just want to get it on the market and get it sold they want to four or five percent commission they're not interested in paying the most and they want to negotiate terms that allow it to they we assume and the services world that we are going to be lied to and that the minute we realize we'd been lied to I Want to be able to fire this person and move on\nThere's nothing wrong with that safety net you're creating for yourself here's the problem\nTop people like me you will not take a thirty day listing\nWe will not negotiate our commission\nWe know we're going to produce for that point you may say with\nNow that I call them real estate hors I don't have a better word for the real estate horrors that are out there\nWill cut their commission will cut their market time we'll cut through whatever it is that they do is part of the integrity of their system that they really know that they should be doing\nAnd if they will do that in the context of negotiating with you for the sake of doing anything to get you to list your home with them\nThey will cut your equity that fast or faster if they won't fight for their own rights their own contractual terms in their own commission right they sure as hell aren't going to fight for what you want for the top dollar of your home they are going to step you in the first deal the first contract\nAnd they may not even tell you about the other two deals that are coming because they don't want to risk waiting on those they don't want to advise you through to make the best decisions they want to advise you through to get a quick commission and move on\nThat is the problem that is created by the crookedness of the industry of housing and by the desire of people in housing to get a better rate because they don't see value to get lesser terms because they don't want to get stuck with the wrong agent the best agents don't negotiate much\nAnd by that nature they won't negotiate against you their client either that is one of the first things you should look at I told the seller I said you got to not always liked the agent you're talking to 'cause they're kind of rough and snappy\nAnd tough you need that to win in the housing business he needed ... fight for their own rights these are the things I look for when I talked to people in the service business not that I like them or did they give me everything I Want but they have a way of standing up for what they want and explaining it to me\nThat's the way to make the best decisions we'll be right back in just a moment he beams singular

instead valuation kind of see where the market is relevant to your home that's house hunting online dot com I give out two websites because that'll take you straight to the home value in there and I do want to warn you were getting some people\nWho really scare me not ... not so much from the radio but people who find it digitally on Facebook where we've we've done some marketing of our home valuation tool\nI don't think I Would want to do any business with you because you obviously don't know the market considering what value you gave us here on this condo in the town right\nAnd I I was stunned actually told the guy this week at the you know what to be honest I don't want to do business with you I I have no interest in taking you're lifting so don't assume that this was prospecting I'm I'm not that kind of aging there are plenty of real estate hors out there and that's what I call them I'm Sorry that offend you but there are people who are willing to do anything to get a listing\nI have never had a hard time getting listening and and so therefore I I don't know sometimes you don't get what you want but because you get beat out if somebody has better sales pitch where they live better I don't know what it is but\nI'm at the end result is is an age and he'll do anything to get a listing of the nation doesn't know how to sell one because you know when you'll do anything to get a listing and you'll try to convince someone at all costs to live with you\nUm that you're setting expectations way too high and the likelihood is that you're not going to sell it but the reason agents will do anything to get a listening is because they don't really care whether they sell your house or not he had to keep this in mind when you going to lose the house won't really say they just don't care if they sell your house or not now they do want to sell it because everybody wants a commission\nBut if they don't sell it there's a safety net for them and you need to know this this is what you look for in the right listening at you\nIf the agent will do anything to get a listing the agent doesn't have that many listings and the reason they want you are listening is they want the buyers that they can get off of you are listening which means the moment the phone rings or whatever happens that someone had done it by themselves as having an interest in your home property condo et cetera\nThis agent is going to immediately as they've been trained by the millions of real estate to convert to buyer prospecting\nWhich means they're going to want to develop a relationship with that fire\nAs they develop a relationship with that by or they have to turn off the sales ether of trying to sell your home that means automatically they are missed serving their flu Sherry duty to you they're not interested in selling your home anymore they're interested in making sure they get a buyer that will buy a home to them\nThey don't give a damn if they still your house or not because at that point they've made their three percent and whether you're how cells are not as relevant I'm telling you that's how this business work that's a it's not overstated it's not as much conscious as I'm making it sound but it is in fact the way it works\nI I like the pride myself in thing I'm not a really great buyers age and I have great buyers agents on my team so when my phone rings and somebody wants to see one of our listings or by one of our listeners are interested in one of our listeners my my I I kind of turn into a used car lot which is when somebody comes on that used car lot what happens\nThis is not how I treat my buyers this is not how I treat my sellers which are mostly my clients sellers\nI treat you as an advocate consultant I that's what my role is but when when it comes to a buyer calling on a sign or marketing piece for one of our lifting\nUsed car lot I got a certain number of cars and that lot and I got to sell them one of the more I don't sell them anything is kind of mentality I use because you've hired me to sell your home\nNot to go and use your home to attract other buyers to become our clients we don't need to do that there's there's ... it's called Google Edwards works rate for that I don't need lifting anymore in order to attract and find dozens of buyers that are going to buy something in the next year or two I don't need a listing for that\nMost real estate agents don't know how to use the technology that's available in our space so they need listening to get the calls it's very very\nCheap it's very\nIncompetent that's wire industry has such a low represent your reputation so when someone calls on a list and you need an agent that's fixated on selling that lifting that's what makes a great listing agent they're an advocate for their clients their seller\nAnd they're a salesman to the people calling on the listing which means I Need to sell this listening to that person and I need to be willing to lose that potential relationship with the buyer in order to do the best job possible sell this lifting that's why when you're a buyer it makes sense not to call sellers listing agents because you may get one like me who just want to tell you that house\nAll right now that sounds that sounds shady no it's not if you were hired to sell a home we got to sell the house we don't need to be worried about taking the listing in order to get other buyers which I can go and buy from Google and Facebook\nThat's the way the business worked if it's being done correctly that's a business that has integrity that serves the interests of the people who sign\nClient arrangements with you that's how it works that's not how Ninety five percent or more of the industry operates Ninety five percent or more this industry does not know how to run a business so they never act like it is a business and that's the problem that people have with our industry\nSo you know I got way off on track but I think that was very helpful and how you select an agent\nSo house hunting online dot com is a home value waiter and that is not a take it to the bank number it's a no obligation instant quote you don't have to talk to us you don't have to work with us we like it if you just tell us your not selling that's fine and we won't keep bugging you\nBut if if um if you go there it's going to give you a general idea if you're going to sell you need someone like me my wife one of the members are team\nOr an equivalent agent of confidence to tell you what the value is in today's market no on line automated system can do that the problem and housing today is it's become brain what's in an accountable\nYou know we uh everybody goes to Zillow and there's a ... are they going our auto value waiter and they they take all these and they all kind of come in the same values some are more accurate than others ours tends to be more accurate in some segments of the market condos are a little tougher for our auto value waiter and what ends up happening so as Brazil oh I've seen wild numbers on their\nPeople tend to let that shake their impression the market all this on line crap is wrong\nIt's ... it's predominantly wrong the reason that the real estate industry\nAnd real estate agents as bad as some of us are in this industry most of most of the agents in this industry are the reason it has not gone by the way of the travel agency and the travel agents in the travel industry\nIs because it's not like airplane flights every home and property is unique and you need someone who has ... human intelligence and experience to unpack all those unique Mrs and converted to price in marketing that's the only reason we're still here\nAnd the vast majority of people that are struggling or not maximizing their equity are doing so we're not doing so because they hired someone that I have a clue what they're doing\nThis also translates to homeowners' associations I got a letter I Want to read part of it from male he's the listener who's a listen for a while um they've got a home in Milton Alpharetta um they've got some problems they had a twenty five hundred dollar fine on their property\nBack in July twenty five dollar a day fine and they live down in Florida primarily 'em and they didn't get the mail they\nSaid that that comment I was sitting in a board meeting it but my primary residence this past week and a couple of well we got to do is mail it and I said somebody I said we we ought to certified mail it we ought to take the honest on us as a as a\nAs a homeowners' association to make sure that when we send out correspondence of legal nature that has a timeline on it or find attached to it\nThat we send certified to say we sent it to you somebody signed for it you didn't get it not my problem but they just shoot him a letter in the mail they slop ally send it to some address it doesn't exist I've had this happen over and over and over again I'm In a battle with with our second home neighborhood now because they just send out a letter to some bogus addressed that they pulled out of their rear end\nWithout looking at the legal address the property\nAnd this happens all the times I Believe these people and writing to me they said you know we've been trying to get this removed from the prior property manager there's been a change in management now they they won't do it first question is who gets the delinquent find revenue this was male the listener here management company or the H away let's stop on that one [noise]\nGenerally speaking in many cases and property management\nFines and fees go to a combination of\nThe homeowner's association which are part of and the management company so there is an incentive to be a terrible management company and they find happy and treating neighborhood or community of condos like a high school hall monitor\n[noise] [noise]\nYou're listening\nTo money off the ... the longest running most respected money issue on the radio I Am Troy harming here today with ... mackenzie and DJ Barker and guys\nWhat's going on ... is it raining in the background so they ought to be going to say this recovering from the week you know it's been quite quite busy yeah I have something going on [laughter] yeah\nWell a little bit market volatility is a little little ... when the market yeah Wednesday market asking the five hundred sold off three percent in a single day which it's been a while since we saw family and then a little bit yeah yeah uh so\nUh volatility back um what's the cause of it I Love about anybody's guess but uh yeah I mean here's the thing uh economically ... situation hasn't changed significantly we do have higher interest rates we also have falling inflation mhm um\nWe've got a which is much better than the inverse of that no doubt [laughter] we've got the fed pretty active in the market they said that they're going to continue raising interest rates in the next one is expected in December um you know so I'm Wondering why don't we see all this crazy\nYou combine that with these midterms coming up which critics route of uncertainty most times on new markets hate uncertainty and you combine that even with the tariffs and all these other things that you know we're planning to be seen yeah right how that's going to impact the overall markets and so\nI I think you know volatility is going to be expected when you've got so much going on at the same time but as we've talked about many times over the week\nThere's not really been a lot of fundamental change that we've seen coming from a either the economic reports which we'll talk a little bit about here are some but also you know we're we're starting a new earnings season and from what I've seen most of it's been very healthy or companies' bottom lines or or still\nUh you know looking great uh they're they're not just beating earnings ... in fact most of them were or suppressing it quite a bit in terms of the expectation yeah for that so fundamentally you know I don't I don't see anything of great concern yet\nHow some of his plays out because because ultimately\nAbsolutely uh so um let's just throws numbers out there three percent after after Wednesday's kicked down um we're down three percent for the week\nSo it's basically that was the whole move 'em if you look at each year today we're up about two percent of the S. and P. five hundred information technology still leads the way a a nine point eight three percent but if you look at what's happened\nUh you know I've talked about it several times we get up to where the S. and be five hundred was twenty six percent made up of information technology stocks anybody want to guess what it is today\nI mean text elite in a way right now I'm night three percent I just said it was maybe Eighteen Twenty one twenty point five so funny you know although it's still shows you that it it is leader here today\nIt hasn't been the leader lately you know as you go from a twenty six percent weight or in technology to make up the overall lives will be five hundred down to twenty percent\nYes what's falling fastest yeah they're the same thing that rose to over the last couple of years so I'm not real surprising but uh looking deeper consumer discretionary up ... percent healthcare up seven and a half\nOr you want to look the other end of the spectrum materials which is really small and it is getting as Jacob keen our analysts are research analyst would say\nIt's getting monkey hammered whatever that means he never tells me what it means but when he says that is the same thing you to just go to him for his ... fourteen point seven eight percent\nDecline ... year today in materials financials or in a similar boat only half as bad seven point seven percent down\nA industrial almost seven percent lower\nUm you know you look at a look at the top end info tech consumed discretionary healthcare the fourth one is uh utilities which is up six point six percent thereabouts so ah some of the some of the things that are that we would normally see lead like consumer staples remember we talked about that when\nAnd how it was in the dumps for a while yeah uh it's only down one point nine seven and if you look at um [noise] what it's done\nA really over the past five days a consumer staples actually leads the way to point to eight percent now ... we've been talking about rebalancing a portfolio\nWe've set it in the middle of the summer you know is probably a good time to pay back your technology by a little bit of consumer staples ...\n... s week shows up perfectly living yeah this is probably still the major point uh you know when we're talking to clients and hey we talk to them a little more these days when you see volatility that's when we are in our keep them you know when when the sky is blue and everything's\nAre coming up sunshine than a robot is really going to call in and fret over their their portfolio but hey when you hear the three percent down day\nPhone rings little little bit more ... clients attention preparing up so now so I'm sure you made a mention of ah of earnings\nAh we're in the middle of earnings season of for the third quarter for two thousand Eighteen\nI'm forty percent of all companies in the U.S and be five hundred had have reported and earnings growth twenty two point seven five percent relative to last year third quarter and it was ... when you need to just be selling everything you know it's great you probably ...\nYeah that's what we're trying to get close comfortable with at the moment you know is it look after all the games that have been had and even for things are still re looking good as you just mentioned sure\nYou got to get comfortable with the rebels process to you know because yeah you might be giving up some growth if you decide you're going to sell a higher high flying stock right I mean we were just hoping that you wouldn't expect to be but\nThey also there's the risk right um and you made a bunch of money now you want to protect some of it but still remain invested so I've got growth opportunity and a production at the same time and and really that that mentality is something that without it can be very difficult to uh to to stay the course and and not end up losing a bunch of money 'cause you remain exposed to all the ...\nYeah but it's still OK to go in three balance now yes the markets calmed down a little bit but from our high right\nIt's still okay just because it's coming down a little bit doesn't mean we stop and rethink ... yeah so I thought the name of this game was to buy low and so high so if we're not selling at the top are we not selling that the ... you know what do you feel you can still make money there's likely allow Roy talking\nAbout earlier you know even though you might sell after this kind of corruption that we've seen over the past week if you're planning to just rebalancing by the securities back chances are those who suffered a bit as well so you know you might not so as high as you could have but you're also not gonna have to buy is how does so it's still as long as you're playing it back into a market than should be fine for those of you who\nHurt his back in the middle of summer saying go ahead and rebalance your portfolio in fact I've been talking about I think we've done it several January yeah yeah I've been talking about it\nSince January in fact we had a meeting the last day of January very almost the last day of January\nOr where our student from folks market was a seven point one percent and I told them I Believe market might get again in two thousand Eighteen between six and eight percent which means at the end of January ousted and told them where up seven point one percent of\nSet up there you go to your neighbor and give him a five point in the market\nUh it you know ... the lack of volatility ... we had in two thousand Seventeen I knew would not last forever or the other pieces yeah we haven't killed the business cycle either so at some point\nThings are going to get rough but guess what I'm Still not seen that in in economic numbers so I still would say um you know stay invested so they invested to your long term strategy but if you're sectors are out of whack\nClean it up to fix our mail and all I can say is if you didn't do it in the middle of summer when we were talking and and you listen to the polls on the radio or maybe this is a little bit of confirmation now um it is time you know ... ... great when it's going in your favor\nBut I like I said you know what sells off fast this is what ruse fast you know the one with the biggest depreciation the fastest appreciation when\nTimes get a little bit rocky and that's what you wind up doing so or ... your point about a earnings out facing even what the analysts that expected we said twenty two point seven five percent growth\nThat is a four point eight percent surprise so basically for four nights a four point eight percent better than a analysts would have said well we would be doing right now so um yeah it is it's what's what's wrong with that\nI look I think the market does does not like inflation right so that's that's called and I would say the majority of this because they are not inflation but just higher interest rates I Wish the fed is doing in order to control inflation so you just think about like this we'd much rather have some higher interest rates than higher inflation now and so so let that\nHappen as with me because that's the the lesser of two evils I Would say and it's just necessary at some point the rage cannot remain as low as they've been forever and we do need to start moving the back of slowly and methodically and then the third is doing that even\nEven though they're continuing to uh get a lot of pushback from the current administration I think it's I think it's the proper move because I'd much rather see that the ... higher inflation at this point\nYou have a real quick we had a existing home sales reported this week a home sales did take a bit of a tumbling September came in below expectations and or\nReinforced the perception that higher rates are going to end the growth in that space uh NBA mortgage applications increase for for nine percent really reinforced uh the refinancing a increased nine point seven percent so that's where the big focus is ah looking further new home sales\nYou you've been paying into your benefit probably your entire working life right so that in in a sense is your money those those things are owed to you and and yet the longer you put off taking the benefit the more you stand to make at least to a certain point but it's by doing so you're having to take more from your portfolio\nThen that's doing a few things number one is probably cause you to have to invest those dollars in your portfolio a bit more safely so that try out the liquidity 'cause you're you're going to be planning for some liquidity but\nNow we would always go by and you're All right I'm In a non any known spending you need within the next ten years should be set aside or at least a accounted for in some way if if it needs to be set aside and your portfolio we would put it in bonds which is ...\nYou know going to be lower volatility than there is that what\nYour lower grades as well we just don't want to have to select would use to get your money we know you're going to need and the thing with armed diseases you don't have to take those in cash so while you do have to take the\nThe money out of your retirement account if there are vested if those dollars are invested they can simply be be moved to an after tax account and remain invested so long as you've got you know some cash there to make withholding some and you want to make one but the point is and I think how we generally feel this is not always the case across the board but generally speaking\nWe would prefer clients to take their Social Security benefits earlier rather than later and while that might cause a discounted benefit to do what it would also prevent them having to take more from from their portfolio which\nAre in most cases it's going to be growing out expected a lot higher rate than what the Social Security benefit tends to grow year to year so if you take that let your assets in your retirement accounts remain growing a or at least in a security that is going to have more potential for growth rather than say a bond or something that\nUh and and so get the money that you're ... because of what you paid in all your life should let your your retirement assets grow and then to the extent that you need more money from your retirement account take that\nBut get the money that you rode a from the Social Security administration first I think because that is money that yours and is gonna really\nWell you'd probably make more progress with portfolios so let\nMe play devil's advocate for a minute so Garrett wind the world would I take it now when if I wait I get more money from the government\nWill look how long you live\n... exactly what we're ... yeah [laughter] so how long do you have any of your family like it'll be an angel player the first question might not I mean it is kind of a morbid thong right but you know you sit down across the table from somebody and say\nWell we can plan a lot better for you if we know exactly when you're going to die can you tell tell me that I Will tell you the day you should start taking so you have to end exactly how much money you're going to spend an hour half\nDisband right for the rest of your time in fact we usually run a financial plan out to what is it Ninety five years old Ninety ... Ninety two really too so you know not everybody lives to Ninety to in fact it's a longer life expectancy than than we would see in the east in the Irish charts where they force you to take that\nTo our indeed conservative just\nYes so uh you know we got a look at the bottom line is\nThat those retirement assets in your portfolio will probably still be there and and be able to pass onto a beneficiary of pulling your death\nThe only thing you can do with that Social Security benefit as as allow your spouse to get yours if that makes the most sense after you're gone but these things cannot pass through generation Social Security benefits that is right pass through generations like retirement essence can so the more you can keep in their retirement accounts\nThe better off you're going to be I think in you know talking multiple generations of them\nBut I'm Talking about family yeah can you remind you pay that and that is you were a tax the ... part tax that comes out of your portfolio your paycheck\nSo and it stops upon death every single time yep All right so ah when we come back we'll finish up this topic\nAnd the answer some financial questions that\nAre around money you're right [noise]\nHitler Norton insurance we recognized the importance of both quality and value when it comes to selecting insurance\nAs a full service insurance agency we provide various types of policies such as home owners an auto insurance\nAs well as in Brelo policies to ensure that you're not exposed to unexpected gaps in coverage by providing clients with customs policies that meet their personal insurance needs we provide them the tools required to protect the most significant investments and there are a lot\nWhen you choose Hitler Norton insurance you're choosing a team of committed professionals who will prepare it customized risk management plan tailored to your unique situation to learn more about the many features of types of coverage available to you contact us at seven seven zero four to nine Ninety One sixty six seven seven zero four to nine Ninety One sixty six\nI'm Dr Gita answer and I want to tell you that my friends down in the park and five plus airport parking\nThere are several outside airport parking choices around Hartsfield Jackson airport but I only use one I use park and fly plus I Choose park and fly blessed because they are for more than just parking while you're away you can have your oil change by jade de loop or have your car wash them detailed\nPark and fly planes features covered and valet parking onsite baggage check in if you're flying with delta and ... with pet\nParadise resort at the park and fly plush offices camp creek parkway\nThey pick you up in five minutes or less and you go straight through security when you get to the airport it's a great way to meet some of the hassles joined air freight Parker programming or free parking and use your card is you're gay key for easy entrance an exit\nAnd don't forget you can guarantee your parking in advance by reserving on line at P.

R. dot com Dr gene insular dot com\nOr you can call her question hotline one eight five five forty nine nine one six six so guys um got another question here Neal from ball ground\nUh asks if I'm delaying receiving Social Security benefits\nShould I still sign up for Medicare at age sixty five so that kinda ties in with our situation we were talking about earlier sure does a you guys\nGot up and you know it's it's the question's a little vague so I definitely want to talk to me a little bit more in depth about why you're delaying I guess sort of because yeah if you're a continuing to work and you have healthcare coverage than there could be benefit for maybe delaying rider Medicare\nI'm generally is going to be free for ... so why not sign up go go and sign up sign up for re potentially sign up for me I don't again depends on what's happening that will give us the details on that but if you delay\nYou can definitely delay but if you'd start delaying be and you should have signed up then there can be a premium increase when you decided to sign up for it once you miss that we are and then you'll depending on the reason why you're delaying could depend on how much you're actually going to pay in that increase in bringing because I Believe it's up to ten percent\nOf an increase which will be ... so ...\nYou you look at you do the math on that and the perpetrator that can be a really meaningful ... exact\nSo I'd like to know why you're delaying but I think yes I mean there's no reason you know if you're if you're able to get the the at least a for free and you're currently working you can delay getting be\n... good reason and they will Medicare answer all those questions worry for sure but I think yeah go ahead and sign up and let's at least call and let's have a conversation as to why exactly and if you\nDo have the insurance through your employer check with them to cause a lot of um if you're eligible for Medicare they're going to try to push you to do that so that they become secondary insurance for\nUh that potentially and so it's important to try to coordinate because you know if if not I mean they're still gonna be it's extra coverage right to do coordinated benefits so maybe if you're still have a twenty percent copay through your your job based insurers\nIt may be putting the two together may actually help you cover more of your insurance costs to cheer or so it it does need to be coordinated I ... I mean we gotta we gotta talk to I knew a little bit more but uh you can you can still sign up\n... even if you have a secondary I don't know we talk about it with clients all the time being with Medicare to secondary coverage right so you you have to insurance coverage is to that point which most people never have the need right but we've also seen clients having a you know\nA sickness they backed which can help cover or car accident\nDoesn't help cover so you know what it would cost rousing later oh yeah I'm just you know a option it's not a bad idea to to just go ahead and sign up even if you're working for a few more months and you just don't want to\nDon't want to do it I think it's a good idea to have the conversation go ahead and it it does take some time to get enrolled so start the enrollment process and and you know give us a call let's talk through our could do a got another one here Tyler from\nSandy Springs rights and man is ever a great topic at the moment or like the S. and P. five hundred my portfolio is overweight in technology I really want to pay back in position myself more defensively good job that's what we want to hear or do I keep a one or two big names\nLike alphabet IBM or ... apple or do I go for an ATF to ride the sector so\nHere's the thing uh I think he has to become so popular and or their performance over the last nine years it's been awesome relative to active management in fact it's actually\nGotten to the point where a lot of folks will say well what's the reason that you would ever want to have an active manager manager portfolio ATS beat it all the time\nWell they beat it sometimes I'll tell you there's only upside anger management is generally more conservative than the overall index and the reason that they are all this way as a group and I know all of them aren't but you know as a group they generally tend to be um\nBecause they have this thing in the back of their mind it's called\nAsset preservation you know just because you made a bunch of money if there is a downturn and unexpected death in the market they don't want to participate in that piece near as much so they positioned themselves so that they're a\nBit more conservative so if it were me and you're looking to reposition and everything's up in the air obviously there's reasons why you might want to consider using an active manager a a a a mutual fund would be a way to do that in a there's some good ones out there\nAre in the technology sector they only focus on that sector or you could use an exchange traded funds so um you know there's a few funds that you could consider um one of them is a ticker symbol I why W which is a shares us technology\nUm it actually tracks the Dow Jones not yes in peace so it hasn't appreciated quite as much as a as the S. and P. would have a you can do with the vanguard both these are going to be really low expense ratio ... um\n[noise] but uh let me see if I can get these pages apart and I'll tell you exactly what the ticker is um but the thing is ...\nThe vanguard version has actually done better than being the T.

Gigi\nExactly thank you DJ and um one thing that I'll tell you is is if you have enough money if your assets are sufficient that you could diversify using individual stocks and let's face it\nIf you just have ten thousand dollars invested you probably are going to be better to go with something that is a buy a portfolio not a stock portfolio is going to be either an exchange traded fund or mutual fund\nIf you've got enough money to diversify yourself in individual stocks especially if you're using a taxable account I Would prefer to see you do that right and there's a reason we're a good one yes absolutely so if you have individual securities that you've purchased\nAnd you see a decline in one of them while the others are going up or maybe you see a decline in all\nYou can actually realize those losses during the year and get a break on your taxes\nYou can't necessarily do that I mean I've talked about this before on the show as the five hundred quite often is up for the year\nBut more often than not you've got a big chunk sometimes as much or more than twenty five percent of the individuals security that are in the U.S and the five hundred if you just only ATF and it's up guess what you got a new law says if you own the individual securities underlying\nYou can clean those losses in the year you still get again overall if your portfolio relatively closely tracks he has to be five hundred but guess what you got a tax break and the game to watch the ... and what not to like about this right or wrong or I guess\nThat's a shot in the end of our show what do you think mark it up or down next Wi Fi Jay moon up\nWilling to rebound and\nThat Philip brought his little brother on our mission into orbit\nKnow I Can't believe how easy it was a project for balance on my car insurance for bank how\nMuch I\nBelieve that guy go goods maybe Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance\n\nOh thank you very happy for them for ... for capital one country card eat when I'm limited capital mile for me to think about it on my middle ... root for everything you by not just Enron critic Rob ... Chicago here I wake up call come capital one\nLast two weeks a and doing it on both sides of the uh\nScrimmage so that's a very important to see that kind of progress a lot of that has to do with the play of a Traveller Lawrence he had his best game last week when he had a not only is the first two hundred yards performance but his first three hundred\nYards perform one of only fourteen three hundred yards performances so far this entire season by an ACC quarterback there just has not\nBeen that many a three hundred yards passing game so far in the league this year marathon is there a lot more than customers they serve communities marathon\nFueling the American spirit will come back we'll take a look at the history of this series which make lumps in ...

you where he was going to be but\nNot sure where he is but I Will have Rodney backed up with is a next week here on the broadcast side so I mentioned obviously the thirty second\nUh ever meeting here between Clemson and Florida State all you got to do is you you go back to last year the thirty one fourteen victory for Clemson over uh the Seminoles that one actually clenched in Atlantic division championship ... yeah it was a lot closer to\nThe score indicated you and you might remember the fourth quarter was Seventeen to fourteen and Florida State hit the ball but van Smith had a interception and a chicken and suing sixty yard return and it set up a Clemson touchdown and then ... physique TNN\nOnly touchdown so we've got two touchdowns in the last three o five of the game to win by Seventeen so ah and then of course the we won the national championship one here thirty seven to thirty four and a great game when shown watch late to touchdown pass into a\nTo Jordan leg and so and it's been tough a tough sledding here we've only one here in\nSeventy six eighty nine [noise]\nThousand six two thousand sixty [noise]\nThat it has been a sort of leads us living here\nOne less thing about last year's game and I think that has to be a big key here they consider running attack last year was really good I think two hundred and twenty seven yards rushing against Florida State man if you can get that kind of\nOffensive out on the ground here today that the thing was still really good things for one yeah absolutely\nConcern runs the ball and and you know in general over during dad was career had outstanding a record but um yeah it's going to be interesting to see how Florida State plays the tigers are when you look at them to strictly they're very good against the run orders disorders state team is aides in the country are\nAveraging given up about a hundred yards for game a show are they going to have the same approach that NC State at you wouldn't think so because\nIt would be Nancy state but thirty four point though that wasn't a very good formula so but just physically what they do is you know they try to take away the run and it was that he can do with the past so uh\nKnow we may have the same type of game as last week as far\nDistribution of yard each from a glimpse of spam [noise] go\nBack and you think about the series one of the things that certainly pops to mind was the belt and bowls that happened from Ninety nine through two thousand in seven at that Ninety nine game in particular a\nIn clumps that I Know it was for you at that time was one of the most ... didn't show all the games that you would ... probably ever been around an ever seen\nAnd it was that I can remember that being that Ninety nine again it was amazing it seemed like there were six thousand people on the sidelines for that gave for getting a number of people that were in the stands I mean it was just it was in some ways for you a media circus it was\nI made it seemed like that game took two or three weeks to play I Do remember we hack\nAre always very media savvy\nAnd we actually did a teleconference with Tommy about ... and his mother a\nTwelve days prior to the game and we had another guinea and the following Saturday but there were so much national media and so much interest from all over the country I went to coaches album we do a teleconference is just about\nYou know the family and and so ah he agreed to it in and out of his father was great at it I\nI remember the other guy remembers that game and also a might put it in perspective\nYou know the uh [noise] how about ... about things rolling at the time because he never had that much pressure on him so we're on the field before the game and a myself with Robert Wilson are organizing the picture opportunity and so we've gotten together and decided the best way to do to to keep the photographers\nShe had to shoot from the sidelines it gives you the interaction with the with the exception of ABC cameras they were the only one\nThey got to admit field so we're out there and they have the meeting and somehow I ended up walking off with Bobby about he grabbed me by the by the shoulders as he just looking around at other people go nuts isn't this great [laughter]\nI Know no pressure on him on it at all you know it was it was pretty easy joined yeah but they went on to win the national championship\nAnd his son almost beat him in that in that game I mean there was a field goal oriented forty\nTwo yards ethical tied the game or we did have overtime and at that time but we actually had a fourteen\nTwo or three lead it a intermission\nSeventeen fourteen\nYou and I often remark or in a law here in this building two thousand and ten were destined Hopkins one from five both you and I were standing on the Gulf Coast that is to the north end zone here\nAt the at the gamble and I uh I still have it on video as a matter of fact it's just the sound of the ball coming off of this book and there's a there's a I have the right beside well that's good to talk of that they would have been good from seven to\nManage just pop that he was a great kicker and it just to get in the NFL was a Washington but uh yeah yeah there have been so great games here and of course I remember the eighty nine game when [noise]\nGoing to clubs really surprised Florida State when I'm twenty seven and a half of the Seventy three are intercept return about ... and in Seventy three are run by Terry Allen when we were literally trying to run out the clock to and\nAnd then a two thousand or was it two thousand six here right or the famous quick snap the run by James Davis is set up a what what turned out to be a seven point went for Clinton\nYeah well they were shocked to random ... because ah we actually James actually scored the winning touchdown would just eight seconds to go in that game on a one yard or one yard run and we want twenty seven to a twenty and it was her first when he was just Nineteen eighty nine so that was that was big\nYou weren't happy at home to have CJ spill or in the booth was when it at home and you go about two thousand nine games CJ just put on a show I guess for to\nSay I did he had over three hundred yards are all purpose running did a little bit of everything\nKickoff returns punt returns had along reception in that game a couple of the long run [noise]\nAnd uh yeah that was a that was a great game for a\nFor CJ towards the end of his own career and then\nI always every time I see id Andre McDaniel always think about his pickup Christian Ponder and they literally pointing at ponder and then he ended up you know ponder comes over to make the tackling breaks ponders Colorado is out for the rest of the ... after\nThe rest of the season yeah that was a\n... two thousand nine or\nTo having you there your route on the ...\n... is a well it's been down there watching uh the tigers warm up on the field read just kind of a Senate seat I mean that the the great thing about our clubs that they never seem to hide never seem to low when they're coming through warm ups like this was\nJust saying if if it was a different feeling the air right now that's a again you you see them come out here to line up to the flex a stretch and then they'll take the arm linked all across the field to the break up a new individual but again as the ... film and right\nKnow what it is but uh again this team has the last few weeks that's come\nAll the way it has a click on all cylinders they've come out and they've they've come down opening drive and and make a big place and took some time off the clock so this is exciting he just didn't get after they against a good ACC opponent\nRead one of the things that I I just continue to marvel at and I don't know why I Do\nBut it's just the sheer number of players that are the coasts when he and his staff are playing I think it was eighty four eighty five last week other they played against in the state the last two road games were clumps when they played all Seventy two players that they have traveled with a you know and I expect you know I'm\nFifty four players in the first quarter last week against in the state I mean it's it's just becoming commonplace to see\nRotation of bodies that is out there ...\nAnd these guys are doctors third or second string guy these guys actually place they come in and they contribute so again interesting ... that you just said what they do not like they're playing the gas nobody like family waits entire game last week so they got some great good called ... I think\nLot of people do it I just don't see what they're doing as far as the death so we talk about it every week guys coming and talking about gender last week coming into the game and and and getting some good quality rep so we got guys everywhere that can play a big successful\nThis level so not only are we getting ... but if you guys are actually getting the play and they're a\nAs I mentioned Finley obviously it was a battle kind of a showdown between the two quarterbacks last week and for a trigger wars that old adage the game is slowing down for him the game is definitely starting to slow down for\nThe freshman quarterback [laughter] we talk about it everywhere that guy's not teaching in this game we need them their feet and the championship or wherever we land of the last game\nAnd every week when you see something different prime example you use I use him as an example time last year around this time [noise] parents and address and drop in assessing the view is that the random searches on the season I Believe and he is a very very talented guy that or even for bacterial and he can coordinate plays\nHe can again guard the best wherever she was on the field and I just goes to show you what they're supposed to have it done and all she's in and what is your husband or I'll shoot and they want to be a championship team and to be a championship game you have to do little things right show up on time\nYou know the details whether it's a a guy with his hand acquaintances eyes twice you know before he's going to catch the ball so you've got to learn those things that come out here I'd like to go to the present I've got some boys\nI remember my hand there's gonna be a great match up of a well\nYou mentioned Jenner hammock Nolan Turner and the and the fact that had the safety did last week man no ... played\nJust as hard on you and again like I said you had guys came in and contributed not\nFloor of the game and they got their start or some rich so you know I think the biggest thing for clubs there's only one football to go\nYou know so it's hard to dish it out but I mean you look at what's going on within the bad\nMain credible history right there's\nNo down and finally rich it is lumps than it is Florida State they once they can't get caught up with that they know what their goals are they usually come out here trying to take care services and I really believe a quake start as kind of paramount for our\nSide of the guests are quick there on the road hostile environment you got to come out and like you said that ... so what am I going to the little things right you think about last week we had a couple of Russian family didn't have any really rushing off and get the ball and Travis be quiet they're proud\nThe young man rumble like he's been doing the last couple of weeks you know\nOut here three and I don't worry about it he meant you don't come out\nThey are going to get every team's best shot number two in the country but again the great ... raise guys are paying for this game all week long season and again this is another opponent and the White House right\nNow good regimen chicken whether you're here at the kickoff do they go Reggie Mary weather from other ... the uh we'll come back we'll take a look at what's going on around the ACC he will do that as a countdown to kick off continues after this this is
