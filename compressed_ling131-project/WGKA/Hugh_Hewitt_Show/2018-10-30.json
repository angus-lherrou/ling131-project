through I think there is that as a blow out\nFirst of all David Carr C. has collapsed and there isn't much of a governor's campaign that she's going to win by more than double digits secondly the early voting is our plus tan are plus ten\nBad is not necessarily going to hold up I cannot imagine a Republican voter\nVoting for Christian cinema over Martha McSally like you might for example in a in West Virginia right maybe they like Joe mansion 'cause they've known Joe for a hundred years but\nA Republican voter and Arizona David ... is not going to vote for Christ and send them to agree or disagree\nNo look I disagree I think it's very possible that you're going to find a moderate Republican woman in the Phoenix suburbs it's been a book of course the cinema as a register her complaint against Donald Trump I think it's very possible so\nThat we did a great I I think that is the most beltway the invention check and I talked about this Todd and I talked about\nThis last week the invention in the beltway mind of a moderate Republican woman who is going to throw away their vote on a senator because they don't like Donald Trump I mean have you met such a\nYes I Know lots of that listens to me like the argument that there weren't such people that were gonna vote for Donald Trump as he was crazy instead of bunch of weird things I've you\nKnow ... different from that argument at the argument is I I haven't seen anyone yet\nAnd maybe a report their name and we can get them on the air of a moderate Republican woman who is going to vote against Martha McSally the first female combat pilot because she doesn't like Donald Trump it doesn't make any sense it's irrational it's\nIt makes it makes it yeah well voting is not always what everybody thinks is rational but these sorts of things happen all the time I think Martha McSally\nA very likely could when I'm just saying that it is not incredulous that there are Republican women out there or some people they consider themselves Republicans they usually votes Republican for Congress that are going to go into the booth\nVote for Doug do see because they Garcia is completely out of whack but that was on a federal issue they're going to take a different mindset into the boots and they're going to say to themselves but I'm going to vote this way on this race I think it's possible\nI think I I think we see this all the time we're on on federal or state or federal issues voters make different calculations and so I just said don't rule it out and when you have polling that's anywhere from you know\nA few points it this way to a few points that way it indicates that there's a close race but I think Mark I'm at Sally\nVery well could win I like the grad sentiment has had a horrible few weeks\nAnd so I'm not going to surprise when Sally way let me just telling\nYou ain't gonna win by ... which she wins by more than five points David truck or let's look back at this conversation because it isn't close it isn't even close that's why I I have a problem with I don't know Manhattan ... late\nI don't think that's just dealt women have media elite look I talked to people in Arizona no race well known excel and want her to win and they are the ones telling me this is a close race they're the ones that are not tell any do big blowout everybody's getting this wrong so it's\nAmerica Bones Are high Canada on the relief factor dot com studio got about Ninety percent of my voice back after fighting the bug for two weeks and so great to be able to finally talk without wheezing\nJoined by Loni Chen die David and dance says he fell over institution always someone what am I go to analysts as we get close to an election which is a week out lawn yeah look at the numbers and I'm very very very optimistic about the Republicans in the Senate and I'm not resigned are losing their houses I was a month ago what say you\nYou I'm In the exact same place as you are I think Republicans look very very good in the Senate fight this is something that we always thought\nWould happen as we got closer to the race that some of these races would settle out and I think we're seeing that for sure you know the house is really a toss up I I think it's one of those things where it's very very difficult to predict exactly\nWhat the margin is going to be but I think Republicans are going to be competitive coming into the stretch run here on the house side but the Senate does look very good question about it\nNow one of the things that ah that I Want to always report objectively my audience NBC and mirrors put out a whole this morning that shows Kristin cinema up five points over Martha McSally now I have seen the internal polling from a Republican pollsters in Arizona the early voting was ten plus are\nThey use a five plus our model for the electorate and Martha McSally wins by five and a half percent under that model and so they're under estimating the actual Republican turnout\nAnd I do not believe Arizona is going to vote for radical and you know Arizona pretty well what do you think\n[laughter] right so I think there's a few factors you first of all absolutely the data I've seen as well from Arizona suggest that the early vote has come in\nI had to pay for Republicans in other words if you compare early vote in ... in two thousand and Eighteen versus early vote in two thousand sixteen uh things are looking favorable in two thousand Eighteen even as opposed to twenty sixteen cycle which was a\n... which was a good cycle for Republicans in Arizona the second point is is just the fact that it just and send them uh\nI I mean not only is this someone who has seen fit to criticize Arizona and Arizona ends\nBut someone who's record is is really from the far left and I think when people really sit down and they think about what the choices argued about Martha next alley decorated combat veteran somebody who has represented the people of Arizona well\nVersus someone like yours in cinema who who's record is really quite out of touch I tend to think that even the late breaking voters will settle in favor of marketing Sally they'll get me wrong it's going to be a close race I think five is a little bit dramatic margin from Sally I think she when she when more in that two to three point range\nBut I just have a very difficult time seeing the people of Arizona voting for the cinema someone who's so fundamentally is out of touch with the values of the people that Arizona\nLaw in the I don't know if you've played our mid term madness game yet\nBut I'm hoping that you will go over to use your dot com and play it because I well I I I Believe the margin of victory said people have to pick the winners and twenty five racist but they also have to pick margin of victory\nAnd I'm going to do plus for for Martha McSally which we have you know under one one to three and plus for a margin of victory and I think it's going to be so much easier than people believe ... but that\nThere is a built in desire in the media\nI mean deeply ingrained almost subconscious to make races competitive when they are not when they hit the wall and it's sort of like Todd Akin hitting the wall in St Louis Christians to them is the Democrats tonic it\nShe just absolutely ran her boss right into off of the Grand Canyon cliff and and there is no way to recover from that topic and talking about voluntary rape um six years ago you just can't come back from that\nLet me talk to you though about the met a thing that's going on here\nDemocrats were panicked or a week ago because the cabin on fact Israel and by the way it continues to be real ah people were disgusted by what they did to Brett Kavanaugh\nAlong comes the crazy bomber David French calls him a super fan I call him a Durang psychopath oceans Thirteen would be bombs and they were bombs to targets and then comes the neo Nazi Trump hating\nMassacre of Pittsburgh Jews\nI think Democrats are hoping that the jar to the country will somehow jar the election and Catherine Rampell writes in the Washington Post saying it's almost ... to me the White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump or poison is\nIncreasingly violent political atmosphere and you know what their rights Trump isn't to blame his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed after the twenty sixteen election now I Believe she sincere and I believe most of the elite media believes that but I think that\nAbsolutely is repulsive to the ordinary American what do you think ...\nI I not only is it is it repulsive but it it it just defies read this notion that somehow\nBecause you've got Republicans that have tried to work together with President Trump in advancing an agenda for the American people that somehow or because they bear responsibility for what is clearly fundamentally the responsibility of arranged a man who sent pipe bombs through the through the u._s. mail\nA and and and they and they of course and filled with hatred who committed in my mind and I forgive all act and so I look at this is part of the media narrative you get it you understand it\nSome point it was always going to get here how is it that the folks in the media are going to figure out a way to try and blame Republicans to turn the election and I think you're I think you're seeing that now\nThe question is whether it's going to work or not and and I'm just I'm I'm not sure that will ... I mean I see the narrative out there I see a lot of people trying to make this case\nUh but I but I just don't see it I think at the end of the day it's election particularly on the house side\nIt's just going to be a whole lot closer than people think\nAnd you know we'll see what the outcome is but I I I I just think the American people are going to come back to the fundamentals here which are strong economy a lot of accomplishment that Republicans can rest their record on that and you get a lot of Democrats running that are fundamentally out of touch\nAnd and I also believe always in the fundamental common sense of the American voter they realize if they don't like Donald Trump\nVoting for example for Christ in cinema is not the response you empower the responsible Republican Senate led by Mitch McConnell you don't empower radical left us\nAnd I think there is um a I'll call it the bounce back in fact people notice when they use aspirin for example in the nasal congestion the more you use it the worse it gets the more crazy rhetoric the crazier gets Julia Ioffe with Jake Tapper last night's among Sanders David Urban onset as well\nGive a listen to this cut number six\n... I think you know the fact that at one of the things that have to wear the launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rattle radicalization and\nWe're having a has radicalized so many more people than I did I mean the way he talks the wasteful waste is is that says it is to stop\nRight there that was David Urban looking just amazed and perplexed as I did now she later apologized they stopped the show they let her come back and do a clean up on Iowa will be button on when you get stuff like that you realize the Democrats are unhinged\n[laughter] yeah I mean this is the problem with with where we are now is that you know look we can all have the discussion about whether we were we could like the president at times to today take a different time I think that's entirely appropriate critique\nBut for some reason I think people on the left to believe that it allows them to do things that are completely ridiculous\nAnd by the way she thought the only one who's been saying you know things like this notion that somehow a you know we we we we pay for what's happening\nWith his lot Islamic terrorism abroad to to some of what we see here in the act you're a despicable make no mistake but trying to draw these comparisons trying to get to use these parallels to attack the president of the Republican Party\nIs it is just off faith and I have to say I do think it is a function of the time we find ourselves in its rhetoric become acceptable\nLet me play for you ah Marsha Blackburn had a rally yesterday but she began with a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh this is what happened cut number eight [laughter]\n[laughter]\n\nInterrupted a moment of silence for ... for victims to do that and Marsha Blackburn was staunch took to Twitter last night I think tendency will be revolted by this is why I think that\nThat crazy woman who did that are destroyed Phil Bredesen any chance of is coming back because it's it's scary it's actually kind of their unhinged\n[laughter] yeah I mean in in in that race in particular Phil Bredesen was already cooked you know if if he could be any more cooked after that I'd you know I mean he certainly is I think I think I think people see that and they\nLet's check the market gender and Todd dot com Mandarin Todd dot com bring to you the free market report that Andrew del Rey taught a bacon

the left actually the White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump poisonous increasingly violent political atmosphere and you know what their rights\nTrump isn't to blame she writes his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed after the twenty sixteen election\nI think she accurately represents the left and the media is point of view and that that is a Republican to most Americans what do you think senator\n... here that that kind of\nRhetoric is more than most Americans I don't know who described her as a but the only person to blame for that kind of horrific shooting we saw in Pittsburgh on Saturday shooter a drainage anti Semite um who should be locked up for the rest of his life\nNot put a ... uh the person that sent those suspicious packages last week or so blame there\nJust as hot then offered Bernie Sanders volunteers persona blind\nFor almost ... and who knows how many other Republican congressman he would've killed if it hadn't been for two you're brave Capitol Hill police officers\n[laughter] let me play for you the height of trumped arrangements syndrome is Julia Ioffe last night with Jake Tapper on CNN cutting number six\nI have to agree with you there I think you know this packet at one of the things that have all we have a launched his presidential run on attacking Islamic rattle radicalization and with President has radicalized so many more people than I did\nFind is that right there she would later come back and apologize for that remark I Want to be fair to wear because they got hammered on the air when she said that but Tom Cotton that anyone could even give voice to that without stopping to show immediately in and said dismissing someone from the set is amazing to me\nThat you remember this is the same woman who accused Donald Trump of sleeping with his daughter a couple of years ago\nUm I Can't imagine that in a respectable journalistic outlet would want to be associated with someone like that uh people like these authors you met you I think sometimes they view themselves as heroes and there are internal morality play\n'em there so the inside the beltway New York bubbled I simply and understand that a lot of Americans uh\nThe president's agenda they believe the economy is growing stronger because we were on our tax\nCode and we're on our regulatory system that our military ... American perspective again immoral I understand that may not play very well in the Upper East side of Manhattan or in the airline but there are millions and millions of Americans across the country and places like Arkansas uh that actually do believe that support the president's Republican Party\nAnd it's fine to oppose those ideas and campaign against us kind of went back and wait\nI'm for that kind of rhetoric is is really a cult\nOr and and I wonder how do we fix the media I think media is poisoning America and I I Try and bring on left right and center and try to be civil with everybody and you're always civil and all the Republicans are any John Kerry a civil and people are civil but I watch\nCable and I think it's just pumping poison from both ends into the mainstream your thoughts last minute senator cotton\nOnline ordering an inventory management solutions are making the simpler for those and worked hard Ferguson dot com and find a location near you\nAnd I try to answer whether\nMorning I'm happy to say we've got a beautiful fall day out there today the funniest guy hides meeting Seventy one afternoon like a little bit of wind out there later on tonight clear motive and kept the tale from the center and key on at the gym now\nLive from the AM nine twenty the answer studios in buck head it's forty degrees\n[noise] use something inside [laughter]\nI'm Eric I'm sure I can give you a thank you for listening to that you hear what show this morning I'm about Ninety percent back\nWith my voice after two weeks are struggling and I want to welcome new affiliates news radio\nFourteenth ten WTO V. in Dover\nDelaware and news radio fourteen fifty W.
