you for ... thing\nWith this because this is this is a big thing to write a book like this to do the research and I and I know and because we spoke on this program before it's heartbreaking for you ah when you when you encountered\nThe horrors I'd tell my audience for those who haven't heard you on this program before\nWhen it was a that led you to tell this story\nYou know at the very center I I it's interesting that you mentioned the Holocaust actually because I often say to people that you know with the abortion story you know sixty million plus children that have died in America it's very hard for people to kind of get their heads around us\nAnd in some ways I think of our film in some ways we we do a little bit of what Steven Spielberg did in ...\nWhere you know you remember that they

wearing a red coat and you'd see her being led\nAway by now the officer and then leaves her favorite and certainly when you see that coat on the floor and that's in a in a mass grave and I think by personalizing it by making by going into the very very detail of one life that was lost and the film does do is go some way to do the same thing because\nAt the center of of the movie is it is a story about one trying to attack their baby boy who was called ... and who you know audiences gets to rip out and know about you know God's will joked about him and all of that um but he got in work life because two of\nThe staff taking photographs of ... and ... you know from you ask about me personally\nHeat that baby shares a birthday with my own father that baby was born on July the twelve and you know I my mother used to talk about the hand of God but I Do think it's kind of extraordinary and all of the day from the year at the time I read the birthday of the child who or an and died on the same day\nOr two of the workers took a photograph of him and their testimony during the trial and in interviews with subsequently\nYou know we're just are a very life changing I Would say I mean Adrian ... who is one of the people who took a photograph with asked you know I asked her I said to her you know God must be awful to get arrested you know and she said I wasn't arrested was rescued\nAnd and she was asked also you know why it she taking a photograph why did you do that why did you take photographs open and you know and she said I thought he could have had a chance\nHe was so big and I thought he could have had a chance to get it how how anyone could listen to test many like ... that was given under oath and by someone standing who had watched this child live and try to breed them try to you know try to survive\nAnd he struggled any ... or the other person who took a photograph coming across described she was asked I mean you know that the idea that this wasn't newsworthy by the way beyond me but\nShe was actually a cream across without to stand up and show the jury\nHow the baby moved how he had moved\nOn how we had actually curled himself up to try to protect themselves because babies at that age you with a little people like that who were like several several lung singer station age you know he you know he'd be cold and the lights would be very harsh\nAnd he had made the movement and she was asked if she stood up and made the movement to I mean it it you know the daily thing that you could possibly come to compare this to this is the Holocaust and people do need to know\n'em and I and it is personal and it becomes personal when you you know can we you know will work in the book for a long time we know you know the details of everyone who gave testimony to the life of this child um and even his mother actually who spoke about the trial\nAnd I think still looking for a long way to ... his life and I Salem says a really wonderful thing actually about baby boy ... but you know I'm not a person can live a really long life that you could live to be a big age uh never do anything significant and you're\nWell this giant already done something significant to even though he lived a very short time he has literally melts at heart and change hearts that change hard heart I told the story of baby boy in Erie, Pennsylvania

caricatured as preoccupied with abortion and on the left today there is no question that day too I preoccupied with abortion albeit with positions and conviction that our polar opposite\nEven in the

past this is the scandal\nOf our time is it I think we're going to look back on this and we're going to be horrified and we're going to wonder why didn't we do something well I guess I Want to say to my listeners see the movie tell your friends about the movie you can go to God's Nell movie\nDot com and do we know how many theaters this is an opening in in in Salem\nIt's about seven hundred across the nation I mean I Would say that people want it opens you know a lot of concern that was when I came to go to the movie later and\nWe have a week or two you cannot will get a week or two Hollywood wants to pose this movie done we work really hard together the seven hundred theaters we need everyone to turn out with a big fine\nWell one one thing we probably haven't said because we know the subject so well and certainly both of you do but but what God's nails did that makes them a serial killer it's not just of course that he's doing very late term abortions which are gruesome but\nThe first aid versus all they saw rubbery come polling preamble\nThe what's going to be said he's going to be talking about this history but a begins and the first day versus so explain why he's talking about the history of what it is exactly that he's going to do\nOther things to notice there and the first aid versus first of all\nHe describes what he is going to do as a parable\nSo in this case what we have in the Old Testament stories the history of Israel laid over against the present time so that we might not repeat the mistakes of those who lived in the past so that's what he's doing that's what this is going to be all about\nThe second thing we want to notice is the emphasis in this preamble upon the children\nAre sort of things that they need to know and for the same reason\nThat the children won't repeat the mistakes of the class to what their father's a done before them\nBy their different ways in which you can apply that but one obvious way in view of the struggles that we're having today in the area of education is this we are not in favor as Christians or what is commonly called Diaoyu neutral education\nWorld strongly believes in value neutral education or that really means is that they resist moral standards they want to be free to do exactly what they want to do and so have you tried to talk about moral standards are absolutely right and wrong you're opposed by\nOur world today and that in a very vigorous way the world will fight for organizations will sue you if you try to\nSay anything that has any morality and that in the public sphere\nOf course we're paying the price for that\nYou throw out morals and people begin to act immoral eighth and so we had cheating in the schools and violence and the schools and rape and robbery and all of the things that would just have been thought impossible even half a generation ago\nAs they went on for that Christian people like the Jews of old out of the responsibility of reviewing the past in order that our children might learn truths from falsified right from wrong and go in the Lord's why are they don't always do it of course but\nWe haven't always done at ourselves either but that's our responsibility\nAnd so we have to do that and we have to do it faithfully now that's the preamble\nWith our mind you come to the second least dams is where he actually begins to get into this and he began was when God's dealings with ...\nThere was one of the twelve Jewish tribes a little bit\nPuzzle to us why assets should talk so much about it for him\nFor a couple of reasons first of all the freedom does not seem to us to be one of the prominent tribes we think of Judah perhaps or Benjamin or or whatever it may be but we don't normally think of ... wouldn't give\nA free and this kind of Providence and secondly the incident that's referred to hear that the men of ... armed with bows turned back on the day of battle\nAs something that we don't even know about\nWhatever that's referring to we don't find it anywhere else on the Old Testament so a little bit of a puzzle\nApparently they they didn't fight the others fluffy turned back but we don't know anything about that or why in the world was asked to take that particular attack\nWell I think there's a very good reason and it was clearly later in the song what we find in the six dams versus fifty six and following where he begins to talk about the free him again is that\nRejected this\nAs a tribe of which the messiah\nShould come in the early ... really was a prominent drive when they came out of Egypt and during the years of the desert wondering when they enter into the\nPromised land to begin the conquest for him was one of the strongest and certainly the most of the miracle of the tribes so you would naturally think that it would be from the freedom that the blessing would come the messiah would\nAt the end of the ... it's sort of ends on that note this is why they asked us to try to\nWe find a God reject any freedom has deprived\nOr wish them aside when Comey established Judah instead and not only did they reject it really rejected Shiloh which was a city and he freedoms territory where the art was kept\nIn order to bring the arc to Jerusalem and the ... the center of the king dome in Jerusalem in the tribe\nSo as you see the point is this is for him did not follow after the large so God rejected he for him\nAnd his point is for us that's just the way it's going to happen if you do not follow after God you find that you suffered for a whole churches have been rejected because nothing on the side I'm gone\nBecause they don't follow after ... remember what Jesus told the church it emphasis in those letters to the churches that we find in the early chapters of the book of revelation Jesus said revelation to five if you do not repent I Will come to you and remove your lamp stem from its place\nLast office saying to the people of his day as we kind of your sin\nSo that it doesn't happen with what's happened in the last it'll happen again so be careful now\nWe go to the next stands up when the\nDevil tempted the\nLord Jesus Christ in the wilderness which has recorded Matthew foreign also look for\nOne of the things he tempted to do is jump off the temple they cause the double said read in the ... psalm\nGod will send his angels to lift you up let's your doctor put against the stone oh he said look why don't you just try it out and see if it really works if you really trust God jump off the temple he'll lift you up and\nYou'll come floating down you won't get hurt people will say a miracle is a great way to begin your program\nAnd Jesus replied by\nQuoting from doing around them eight six six team\nThe taxi replied with was this you shall not put\nThe lord your God did the test he replied rightly or when we come to this\nNext stands understands that begins with her Seventeen we find that that's exactly what the people in the wilderness did first Eighteen says they will fully but God to the test the problem\nWas first that the people were just satisfied with what God had\nDone they wanted more ever find yourself\nBeing dissatisfied with what God is I think of all the God has given us this thing back in previous ages of this world history how people suffered without\nLife nice we have all of that\nAnd yet we're dissatisfied we want more\nThat's what they did the first thing\nAnd then secondly they considered that the reason why God did not give\nEverything that I wanted was because he couldn't do it so if you put that into the logical terminology they're citizens were first in gratitude and then second on belief ... and those two areas that they put God to the test now\nAnd so there's concern here to highlight the bass nature at least ... only does it is by highlighting\nThe abundance of God's blessings you just read through that sense and you'll see how he does that he talks about God raining down man or on the ... plenty of food he talks inverse twenty five of them having all the food they can eat and as for water\nVersus twenty says when he struck\nAnd streams flowed abundantly\nSomebody saying saying the food was not poor fair calls it\nA little later on the food of angels us for water there are plenty of water to drink and yet the people were still decided by what they say versus Nineteen is asking God spread a table in the desert I mean the kind of table we would like to\nVerse twenty any supply meat for his people and given as a matter\nThat is he really able to go beyond that they would have given me that's what we really wad\nOf reminds people and so when I asked for me God gave him the ... when they got ...\nAnd many of them died because I subsides God's finger\nFlooded out against the people because they weren't satisfied with what he had done dissatisfaction with God when he's given his all things richly in Jesus Christ is certainly one of the greats and those are the church\nA judgment that is mentioned at the end of the third stands up\nLeads into the subject matter\nOf the fourth stands are witches versus thirty to thirty nine\nThe theme of this stanzas repentance and the connection is is when the people were judge a repented problem isn't there repentance wasn't true repentance that sort of temporary little thing to get gone off their backs as it were look what NASA obsess versus thirty four thirty seven\nWhat's the camp they eagerly turn to him again they remembered that God was that rock that God most high was their ...\nI Would flatter and with their mouths lying to end with their tongues their hearts were not loyal to him they were not faithful\nTo his comments as say that's a hypocritical repentance and it must be nauseating the guard Juan\nJose us as in his proposition\nSo that are truly buttons involves this first of all an honest acknowledgement of sin if you don't hear much of the day secondly of turning from it and third and appeal to God's Grace though\nThat is absent here\nAnd that there is a striking now almost a surprising though because in the same standards\nThat talks about this false repentance Assam says nevertheless\nAs

today\n[noise] men and women are different in so many ways it with the conclusion of a word for wives and help for husbands is Adrian Rogers\nMen tend to think more logic that doesn't mean they're smart but women think or say motion that is what we call a woman's intuition and therefore why\nEuro logically figuring it out she's already arrived at the conclusions that I don't think we'll do that well why not just oh my God oh wait I make a difference let me tell you well know gentle and aggravating thing is they are so often or right\nI mean they just run a short circuit somehow all these little into the things that are in their mind they come and I think what's their emotions\nAnd fringe you better listen with your heart not with ... because if you don't listen with your heart you in a heap of trouble\nBecause you are trying to be logical while she's being emotional and of course vice versa women need to understand and give their husbands the opportunity to express themselves logically as God has given that particular gift\nSprings and thank God for the fact that he is given a husband has a protester and the home but what I'm trying to say this but the the Huston owe to the Y.\nConsideration he needs to do well with her according to knowledge there is a genuine difference\nBetween men and women psychologically now secondly\nNot only do you owe to your wife consideration you also older her courtesy\nNow he says that we're to dwell on them according to knowledge what does that mean giving on or onto the why\nAs onto the weaker vessel now that word on\nIs the same word that has translated believe it or not earlier in this book\nAs precious concerning the precious blood of Christ that is your own life is to be precious to you that's the kind of honor you to give her the honor of that is that can\nBe All right when I send you a respect for the blood of Christ you are to give her on her\n\nNow as onto the weaker vessel you say well she's weak so are you notice that says a week or a vessel as a comparative term that she's weaker and weaker than what weaker than you which means you're weak\nBright man you're weak\nAs a matter of fact that's part of the problem with marriage that two week people get married but the first one is don't honor the weaker vessel he used to treat her as precious we men\nNeed to do this to give this this\nHonor to our why not have you done that\nHave you really given her this on or have you protected or how do you own your wife where you say I brag owner\nPatty brag on oh honey I just think you're beautiful well that's all right you tell her she beautiful but you see if that's what you brag on all the time is her physical beauty do you realize what a threat that is to her you said her well Donna I just love you because you're so beautiful\nWell I'm a I've already told your friend that view is not going to last forever\nAnd so if you tell her now that's really why I Love you because you're beautiful what if she has a Supreme Court figure no appeal [noise]\nAnd you're just telling her now I Love you because you've you've she's going to say if I was all he says he's lying\nOr a beauty is such an important thing to him when somebody else comes along more beautiful he's going to love her\nBut if you give her on I mean if you respect her for her character you remember the Peter puts a great emphasis upon character qualities the argument of a me kind of ...\nWhy don't you want you serve for that ... why don't you give her on her for her faith for missing her purity give her on her for the way that she manages the household tell her that you love her\nFor her patients with the children and these things and you're going to understand that that is meeting on me that she has\nThat if you don't meet that need you will have fraud at her you are not giving her the honor that indeed she is worthy up and indeed that she cranes and so you were to put her there on a pedestal and you were to give her that honor that is hers now\nShe used to be that precious to you\nOh why should ask yourself this question do I love my husband enough to live for him\nBut a husband should ask him selfish question do I love my wife enough to die for her and let me tell you something Mr\nBy Bible never commands the husband a rule is why the Bible commands the wife to be an objection to her husband both the Bible does not command husband\nA ruined his wife he is to ruined his life but it doesn't come amateur ruin why why\nYou see you're not to use the Bible as a club to beat her over the head with and say some some in some in the Bible says you\nKnow no no\nYou do not course er into submission that is not submission if she's co worker she hasn't submitted she's only humid you see submission must be willing\nIt must be voluntary\nThat's come out of a heart and it cannot be cooler\nAnd therefore you to love her into submission out as Christ's love the church\nDoes he coerced us to submit if he did there'd be a lot of changes in this auditorium this morning wouldn't it I mean of Jesus Christ would come in here and clean house\nI mean there are a lot of people here in this auditorium that rebellion against your hand or things in your heart and in your life that ought not to be there how is Jesus Christ seeking to change you\nBy loving you\nWhy are we love him because he first loved us and the Bible\nCommands the husband do love here's why\nDon't love her bats are command love your white lovers Chrysler bitter how did he loves the church sacrificial a saving late sanctify English steadfastly supplying that's how he loves the church\nMy assignment from God and your assignment from God is to make our wives radiant lead beautiful Christian\nWe are to give them as onto the
