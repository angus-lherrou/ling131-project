my program Congressman Mike Gallagher of the house armed services committees are defence expert at a Marine Corps intelligence veteran himself\nWhat get right down to it the danger zone has receded according to I'm reading a real clear politics story here the congressional leadership fund has seen see six districts will hurt Andy Barr might cost Rodney Davis Brian Mast John Katko recede into said comfortable territory\nIt if we're down to twenty to thirty districts that are competitive and they sound pretty optimistic it on hold the house or Mike Gallagher what do you think\nWell this is anecdotal but certainly in the Republican Party ... as we have around my district an artificial Scott than we've seen in a surge in\nVolunteers coming in people coming in that aren't necessarily party faithful to pick up signs and ask\nWhat can I Do to help so I Do sense a slight momentum shift I've always thought this was going to be a nice that when we talk about control the house you know five seats one way or the other uh but also my understanding is that are real opportunities to pick up some seats\nFrom Democrats in Minnesota and that the Democrats are pulling out of a couple of states that look if you try to get our direction so again we got to run through that you have\nThis is you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't take anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down the candidate quality and sort of the twenty to thirty states that we are talking about here\nAren't don't let me talk to you about some defense issues first of all the F twenty twos at Kendall a it's a murky picture or I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt bad bad but maybe we did get hurt that bad maybe a danger to stealth technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment at why by the way do we keep as twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell you try to read through this and I'm looking forward to being back in session in November So we can ask the hard questions of aid figure out what exactly happened\nIt seems like Seventeen twenty Jews are damaged I think ten of those are cats and the storm rated hangar but no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus miles per hour winds and seven of the seven of the Seventeen were lesser rated hangers I think it's important to note that no one thought this would be a four to five little earth in forty eight hours\nPrior I'm not trying to make excuses for the military here\nUm but the planes are based in those so that they can have access to the training range of of the Gulf of Mexico no one would want a budget that twenty two going into super cruise over Kansas it's too disturbing to the local communities\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country\nSo as best I can tell him talking to officials plugging experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be repaired but the problem here is the skin on the plane there's a lot of radar absorbent material ram involved and the repairing and replacing could be very expensive and my understanding of the initial site survey suggests that the air frame\nAppear to be okay so we believe we can get most of them back on track to repairing the skin um will be a very expensive proposition finally I just stay out of your question why were so many their ground this goes back\nReally to the Obama administration decision to hold the program a two thousand nine Secretary Gates was the ultimate decided that decision and the decision to cut back on air force personnel and train maintain ers and funds for reading it so we had to answer the reason that the question that so many were on the ground in the first place\nWith their engines pulled it because of the lack of spare parts and a lack\nOf trained people short hair that President doing worthy job
