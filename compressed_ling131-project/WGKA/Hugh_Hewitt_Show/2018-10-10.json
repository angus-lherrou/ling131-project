ask you about it um\nWe've obviously got Nikki Haley who ah Donald Trump on new for the past six months was only gonna stick around 'til January and then leave because she just wanted to two years temp and there's all kinds of rumors circulating about who might take her place now Joe chimed in and said Donald Trump should appoint Sarah Palin\nShe has more ... than most men\nAnd she's plenty smart and she's been a staunch supporter of the president since day one the fact that she's fantastic looking wouldn't hurt matters either\n[noise] um I listen I'm I I I Would I think that'd be great choice but um you know it's going to happen up on the hill and the confirmation process Sarah Palin it's got to be an absolute a ... mess bloodbath uh yeah it I mean they're going to go after her and I don't know if she wants to deal with that type of\nBomb plot that she's going to be taken in from from all the Democrats in ... in regards to this I they keep throwing out the name Powell a no no no no matter how much you know I Need another Goldman Sachs person up from a ... enough\nI'm not going to be thrilled with that number come down hard on Donald Trump be a point you're you've got to get somebody outside the box again a Nikki Haley governor\nI'm very successful governor in South Carolina a great choice or somebody like her yeah now\nI've got a I've got to Syria or a little bit of Assad here on a Sarah Palin because she came out and she um [noise] uh said something a over the weekend about job I'm Lisa Murkowski and she said I can see two thousand twenty from my house\nUm was it was Lisa Murkowski got to run again in two thousand Twenty years that's right that's right\nWell there you go maybe she'll she'll end up running because people um it was interesting I really think about\nWhat would have happened if a cabin on didn't get confirmed in the court remained at a high\nUm I heard somebody told me about this is the fact that you have a tie and Alaska is under the jurisdiction of the ninth\nCircuit court of appeals correct so any cases that went to the Supreme Court from the Knight court and they came out as a time let's see these are things in regards to a a land development in Alaska or whatever it may be it will revert back to the lower court judge which is the Ninth Circuit so that the Ninth Circuit would be\nPretty much in in in the case of the ruling over Alaska many uh you know the closely decided situations\nThat's absolutely correct and that's what would happen um but of course judge Kavanaugh took his seat yesterday or his girls were given permission to be out of school so they could watch what he did his wife was there and it was kind of a family day yesterday so it was and it was a big deal it's a big event for somebody after what he went through I mean shame on\nHillary Clinton and the Democrats and whoever else was behind us and by the way I was told right from the get go that this whole idea was payback for the Clintons\nAnd this young aggressive ... attorney that we're working with Ken Starr who did a lot of the investigation on Bill Clinton into model ...

Grinnell to go to Germany he is on the shortlist replace her along with Robert O'Brian admiral stabbed readers when you talk to the president what qualities as opposed the names are you going to urge him to look for in a UN ambassador\nWell before we look at the future let me say how how grateful we all our\nPresident myself our entire ministry ... for the extraordinary job or that invested or Nikki Haley's done for the United states at the United nations or she is she has a ... you know\nTaken the presidents America First agenda uh carried it into the\nThe for the United nations should choose to traveled around the globe advocating\nAmerican interest uh and uh we will miss her in this role she is a personal friend of mine and she and I spend a little bit of time or after she was in

and grace and we wish her and her family every blessing in the years ahead you\nVery tough act to follow so how do you follow it\nWhy they will be a decision for the president but uh there are a number of men and women are that the that that would be a very qualified very able to follow on\nIn that role but what I can promise shoes the policies aren't going to change I mean one one of the things that has is I think than than most uh uh admirable about the job that ambassador Haley did at the United nations that are secretary's day my ... my ... doing now John Bolton is doing\nIs is every single one of these folks gets up every day or to carry the agenda that we were elected to advance\nOn behalf of the American people that America First agenda on to the world stage and so we're we're we're looking for folks that are that are not only can follow in the big shoes that Nikki Haley is going to leave at the un but we're we're going to be looking we're going to be looking to fill that spot a with someone who comes in with just as much bigger to advance\nAmerica's interest to advance the America First agenda and to and to continue to see of\nAmerica um respected again on the world stage Nikki made that comment in the oval office today and I I can tell you having\nHad the opportunity to travel around\nThe world over the last two years few um and uh I'll be headed to the Asia Pacific here in in about a month\nOr as a as I've met with world leaders as I have witnessed or the response to President Trump's leadership uh on on the world stage there's no doubt that America is respected again and that is a credit to the president the entire team and and uh\nAnd we are so grateful for the contribution to Nikki Haley's made to that cause as well\nIt does take some sparkle and some charisma like ambassador Haley that's why I bring up Grinnell Robert O'Brian and and James ... ... we got apso sparkle there\nWell look it's a it's the United nations is a big state\nAnd uh having having the right talent they're all of those people are\nAre outstanding people or other people there's actually there's a great number of people that have already expressed an interest in that position but I\nI I can tell you I'm I'm I have every confidence that the president or we'll we'll make sure that the United states is a once again well represented on the floor of the United nations and continues to advance a advanced said that ah agenda that's making such a difference\nFor the American people and for American credibility in the world\nIs right for them I couldn't be happier with

according to Hillary ... what happens between two people from\nWhat I was at the polling lots of Italy is the opposite Seville I I had\nA long time since I've heard a somewhat responsible member of

you show up to vote for Ted Cruz do whatever you can support regardless of where you\nKnow what let's close by going back to the hearings are your review the confidential FBI report we've only seen the summary of it was there any contemporaneous corroboration\nOf Dr forwards allegation I Know the capital ... go ahead\nAbsolutely not nothing in fact there was the opposite of cooperation\nIt not only did you have every alleged eye witness saying I have no recollection of it but you have multiple alleged witnesses saying not only without remember they happening if they didn't the type of

work she'd worked for the FBI at the same time they're pretty far away as the southern district of New York us attorney and we corrected\nThat but what do you think with Chuck Schumer driving this past\nI don't know where with Chuck Schumer of himself\nIt it certainly could have done\nWhat it was something going on here because there was a decision made more along the line\nAfter they became aware of this information and six weeks until it actually came out\nThey were doing stuff they were hiring legal counsel referred by for some of the fines but there were polygraphs on the same day

throw it in the weird eleven votes to get it out of committee\nBut I think a real turning point was senator Collins speech excellent speech\nAnd now you can see how the uh uh liberals are ganging up against her and they don't have any right to do that because she's been very much of a feminist rowdy time and they raise money at three million dollars to run against her and I think conservatives ought to get\nBy saying thank your door\nAnd making sure that she doesn't face to the uh\nThe onslaught of this a mob that was a\nA up against Kavanaugh\nI think the ... of the center right will rally to her greatly in twenty twenty if anyone has the dumb enough to run against Susan Collins of Maine like running against Chuck Grassley of Iowa you just don't do some things center a I have Michael Yon last hour he explained to me that he and his family were dogs\nThey're private information put out on the Web did that happen to you as well\nUh it must but not to the point\nThe fact of them and some other senators I got some midnight calls ah that I didn't answer the phone but there was an effort to intimidate me ice holds true of phone calls I'm when I heard one four letter word hung out but I never answer it any other\nUh for law of phone calls on the ah that particular night out I think it only happened one night to me so I was fairly lucky look at what happens to people like\nRand Paul or Mrs Paul and and the lady and I don't know how many other senators or even Cruz being driven out of a restaurant and what happened to the a couple of months ago to the\nPresident's press secretary or this is mob rule it's in your face and we have senators that are saying get in their face we're having Congress women say a a\nA front a confront a cabinet members ... if you see I'm In a restaurant and um and it's a sort of thing that leads to more instability in our society\nAnd a if anybody thinks there's instability in Washington\nA it was just kind of a reflection of the grassroots but on the other hand those of us that are public servants ought to set an example of civility so we can get this a country calm down bring us together so a book or saying something like get in their face or a\nA congresswoman waters saying what she said uh it's just a it's not the the epitome of leadership the Republican and Democrats in Washington DC ought to be emphasizing\nNow secretary of State Clinton a pro Christiana pour yesterday that a civility is only possible after the election that that you can't be simple the people who are trying to destroy you were you shocked by her ... her comments\nNow of course I was shocked by it and I hope that Republicans and I assume or comment come because Kavanaugh\nWas successful or we were successful getting cabin on the courts so my rallying cry for the next twenty eight days of this election is remember cabinet shop and I hope that we are Republicans and I hope\nPeople that want Republicans had voted for Trump or realize that if there is a Republican majority in the house of representatives not only will there be talk of impeachment of Kavanaugh or the president but even if there is talk of impeachment effectively the program\nOf the president's going to come to our own they all have a two year a Trump presidency the last two years we'll be status quo and let's see Israel acted\nOr that the end of it so if you like the victory of twenty sixteen uh get behind Trump and vote for Republican congressman capable Republican majority in Congress otherwise Trump is done\nNow a Senator Grassley I always ask you about pending nominees there are ten appeals court nominees before you three are out of committee will all ten of those nominees get a vote before the end of the year\nWhile there's more than ... there's forty one on the counter right now and I find there's tanning there's cannon our committee and I think there are all fully Thursday I get the pan out of our committee of ... ah\nMcConnell all to keep the Senate in session until we get all forty one of those judges dot org I'm an ad and can work through it at ten more to it\nAnd I'm Talking about the appeals court nominees and I'm Wondering about the cabinet vacancy on the DC circuit is their time for a nominee to come out of the White House and be confirmed by the end of the year for the DC circuit nomination vacancy created by Brett Kavanaugh's promotion\nIf we received it right now the answer is yes but just before Christmas so kind of depends on how how long will be inside and by the way I'm not a denigrating your efforts to get ten a circuit court judges approve because I'm In favor of them as well and we're ... we're\nPushing them for instance we have to ... Ohio\nSupreme Court judges on the counter for today's hearing as one as another example\nWhat's on the border to take care of Ohio center that I'm from Ohio so I'm I'm all in favor that let me go back and ask you about a an interesting thing Lindsey Graham said if I become chairman and I immediately looked over Chuck Grassley worst Chuck Grassley going in is there another committee that interest you more than judiciary\nA well don't forget the first four years I was chairman of the Finance Committee there's two more years of service German the Finance Committee but I Will be making a decision on that and my decision if I were to go someplace else would affect Lindsey Graham ah but I'm not going to make that decision until November the seven\nAll right now can you tell me if you think I'm a member of the D.C bar I'm also remember the California bar a I'm not actively practicing law now but they might easy bart is do you believe the district of Columbia Bar ought to investigate Dr forwards lawyers because she said she was not aware of your committees repeated offers to come to her in California\nWell it's a it surely isn't representing her client right and and I'll leave it up
