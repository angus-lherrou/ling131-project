question you asked I'm just going to run this by you\nHave you noticed the polls and who's doing the polls and what some of the numbers represent and where the polls are being done or how the numbers are one way one day and another way another day and another way another day in the ... have you noticed that with the Gillum and whatnot\nI I I look a little bit um I have a tough time 'cause again I I find many of them very much unreliable that try and get a lot of these polls that you know they are pushed polls they start them way too early that's right um you know you don't know what's gonna happen up until close to the end we we all know this on so you know I I\nI don't know I just you know what I Know it was like in the state for it looks like it's close\nWell it's close to a certain degree but there are polls internal Florida polls that are being done down here by far the polling agencies in groups newspapers radio stations all that sort of thing which are more close to being accurate\nA lot of them show a either an even race between Gillum and dissatisfied with the show to send us up by two are Gillum up by one all that sort of stuff is a lot different than the seven here and the five there and the nine there which none of that is it's crap\nIt's not true we just as of one the one poll that remaining constant is Rick Scott is ahead of Bill Nelson Bill Nelson is in trouble and he's about to be retired\n[noise] um I I can with with that too I Will talk about just briefly yesterday yes and how um you know I it's it's weird if you're you know if he is that far behind Rick Scott fed it would seem like the ... the whole ticket would kind of go in that direction\nBingo you're there you go there you go out and yeah and we've got eight percent more Republicans the Democrats have already voted down here in Florida with the early voting and you know the way they voted\nWhich is rare because usually Democrats come out in early voting to much greater degree\nWhile they're counting on the millennials to vote and like you and I've talked about many times it depends on number one whether or not they're sober number to whether or not they're not stone and number three whether or not they can get out of bed before three o'clock in the afternoon whether or not they're going to show up at a polling place\nOr thing too is that um you know millennials are start or do a little bit better um they're starting to I mean they they are obvious for them that the economy\nIs starting to work for them to a greater degree you're talking about a coup kids never really saw uh the type of economic growth that we get in our lifetime trying shall now\nSo they've got a different sort of a different perspective now saying that things can be different now you know obviously the mainstream media is done everything to make them think that Trump is anti Christ um but you know you you take a look at your wallet sometimes that Seoul and you might start to take out a little bit differently\nI Want you to listen to thirty one seconds of Morocco Obama in two thousand and six\nAlready generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or the becomes immigrants in this country\nThat is exactly the position of Donald Trump's administration and everybody in it and that's exactly what Brock Obama said in two thousand and six and now he's chastising President Trump for what he said in two thousand and six\nYeah it's funny 'cause a clip too I like the ... the truck Trump's actually created that clip out he did a good idea that I I agree a hundred percent Obama he did it I thought was funny I got a clever but uh yeah um yeah that that's funny how they\nThey twist and turn to various different positions base which way the wind is blowing\nYeah well here's the thing we talked about the economy now again a lot of the younger generation doesn't realize that we actually had something and it was called the bad economy and we had it for eight years under Morocco bomb and now you're Twenty one\nOr eight years you would have been Thirteen maybe you weren't even thinking about the economy back then because it might not have applied to you unless you were looking for a job I'm going to find one now you look for a job and there's two or three out there to choose from\nAnd and you know what your your employers that are competing for you you ... you know you could put you in a better position as well in regards to negotiating salary benefits everything that goes along with that so much much different type of scenario\nAnd did anybody ever tell these uh college bound folks that you don't necessarily have to have college anymore because of votes ... it's like one of my sponsors nationally mission academy where you can go there right out of high school and take their fourteen month training course and come out and make all I don't know Seventy thousand dollars a year\nWell yeah and I say that uh you know we now have a situation where actual other types of businesses big businesses like\nApple and Google and many others are requiring a college degrees anymore and they're doing the training as well uh yeah I I talk at great length about the er about getting a college degree of how to do it in a way what you're not\nBreaking the bank and and uh you know that they're there to basically having to be smart in regards to going out and and getting a degree rather than getting yourself at the ...\nYeah exactly and or a car so\nThe one thing about getting into debt is getting out of it and uh you need to understand the young men and women that are out there\nWell it's not going to be you know I'm hearing things like well they're not going to forget my college that they were going to do that everybody's going to know it got to pay that of course you got to pay this alone it's a freaking loan guarantee of free unless you maybe you're joined the military and then you get a college scholarship\nTo go to the ROTC program right\n[noise] well listen you know that that's part of the problem is that you know your college\nLoans are not discharge pull in bankruptcy not at all I um if they were discharged on bankruptcy court then the interest rates are college loans would be\nUh the same as they would be for credit cards right and people wouldn't go out and they wouldn't take them and you know in my opinion that would be good because then you know what if there was no student loans that was not have been these colleges and universities would actually have to price their products based upon what people could afford to pay\nAnd this again is another reason why the vote tech schools are being very successful right now because the costs to go to a vote tech school is about oh I don't know half\nOf your first year's income so to speak and then you get four or five or six or maybe even ten years to pay it off that's not too bad but most people to get a job they want to pay it off sooner so they do and then you're on your way and guess what you got money in the bank money in your hand and you've got a credit record which is something you don't have the other way around\nTwenty manager whether these guys out there today with high nearing

about\nOur friends its citizens for truth and drug pricing they sponsor mean you've been doing some great focus groups an HBO that people can also see by media or what your reaction to the fact that President Trump\nAnnounced he's going to do at least ten more rallies between now and election day ah October thirty first and election day with as many as two a day in different states what do you make of his trail thumping\nOn that he is committed to keeping Congress to Republicans oh and this is a dramatic turn around\nIf you go back just one year ago today he was bashing Congress he was telling people\nThat this organization was holding back is agenda wasn't distinguishing between Republicans and Democrats and that's one of the reasons why not only was Congress disliked by the Democratic party they disliked by his\nOwn voters when he goes out and you see this much energy on the mid term um stage Frank Luntz is that unusual for president facing a mid term or can you always get a crowd that crowd Wisconsin last night was the Mets\nAre there is no one like him now Obama also too big crowds\nBut there was more of a curiosity with Trump it's almost like an old time revival there is a mix of passion and intensity and and so I was a feeling like\nThings are different today than they worked ... years ago and show it's not all good it's not all of it\nBut there is an appreciation that there are more jobs now than there's ever been there more people working in there is that we're in\nIs although unemployment level and that has been in and fifty years and it's

Missouri I it it is [noise]\nYou know the jury race as slipped there is no other race that I think outside of North Dakota had drawn a dramatic more dramatic effect\nA post cabin on the Missouri which was one of my other stops I forgot the advent of their um and then I Would say of other places I went and Nevada's but the place that they have like the second biggest impact\nI take less so and in Arizona and Texas actually she was a whole as a whole separate ball game\nGoing on with what you're talking about the time when\nI Would say Missouri and Nevada is where you could see steel here can affect\nShut cruises actually coming up right after I think he's listening to you right now what did you find in Texas\n[noise] you know it's interesting and it's it's it's um\nThere's clearly increased turnout is clearly ... increasing gauge minutes\nThat you see 'em but that's a race to stabilize you don't want I I ... when I Can't really put my head around is that when I when I compare I'm watching Beto O'Rourke running a red state as a Democrat and compared to here soon sit on my own Arizona\nPrepared frankly Claire McCaskill of Missouri Bill Nelson of Florida journal mansion and how much do Brett is\nAll of those other Senate Democrats I pointed out [noise] out are making some slave center [noise] um what I find fascinating and this was the great experiment this election\nIs is it better or is it you know he's on a passionate about is is is positions just progress ideal uh on one hand it's paid for I think it very clear choice between core listeners but it's probably the type of course a choice the cruise cruise want\nI Want to ask him running as say\nBecause it it is you know I think you could make a case that it's possible he could have been bombed them a different way I'm just going at while or kids excited the Democratic base in Texas and I think it's a little bit bigger than I think any of us anticipated\nI I Can't you know part of me thinks voice he ran a little more like she'll Brett is my guest is Ted Cruz would would be would be look he's acting like he's nervous enough a lot of money that's been raised ... I think it'd be more ...\nI I we're gonna leave with their Chuck Todd and we'll see you tomorrow night on meet the press the alien of course if it's Sunday it\nWas ... I Hope I Hope we both get our boys over just got to stay on the porch or it's okay [laughter] talk to the jak now we're to Ted Cruz senator from Texas you just heard what a Chuck said I think he's a good bet that was runway ... what do you think\nWe got ... with us Sen Cruz\nYeah I'm I'm I'm here to do your job what do you think I I think\nThat's right I'm also glad to join the horse sports club like a two week that from election day and and anyone who spend their time doing politics that a little bit of horses right now\nI'm he was saying beta was run hard left how can any haven't run hard left in Texas you get\n... you know that that has been in pain from the beginning is that typically in Texas Democrats at least at least pretend to go to the middle and and from the very beginning\nA battle roar made the decision to go hard left these running like Elizabeth Warren is running like Bernie Sanders not what it's resulting is meant the money he is the number one democratic fundraiser the country ah last order a bed or walk raised\n... million dollars that is the most money ever raised in a single quarter by any candidate for US Senate\nIn history that a lot of money and and and what happens is every time O'Rourke embraces a left wing position every time he comes out\nAnd called for aging President Trump which has millions of dollars ... flood into the state every time I talked to a a abolishing like what she has millions of dollars flooded to the state and I think in many ways he is playing the national liberal donors national liberal activists\nAnd and the people that he doesn't play to our our our actual voters in Texas who care about jobs and care about securing the border of care about the constitution or he he had bought responding to the interests of the people\nWithout Sen Cruz talk to me a little bit about these nine a\nSuspicious packages at least one of them was a real bomb out of the president's condemned with the vice president condemned that Rod Rosenstein condemned the I'm sure you're going to condemn it but the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy it's either something not in the basement or it's a hospital power messing with our election\nBut what do you make the attempt to blame Trump\nI Love it if the media dealing with the media does which which it any any narrative that they can twist against Trump they will do so uh this is terrible I mean this is terrorism and whoever the terrorist is ... needs to be caught\nYou need to be prosecuted needs to be put in jail for a long long time\nAnd are in a non profit that'll happen you know it's interesting you remember some months ago uh we we had the bomb or in in Austin a that was setting up bombs throughout Austin and and I met with uh the ATF boats and the FBI folks were leading that effort for seven and at the\nFederal law enforcement had tremendous resources to put\nA bear to track him down in terms of the components of the bomb I Know there I'm sure\nThey're analyzing all of those now\nWould catch this guy where to put it behind bars but but it is wrong violence is always role or wherever it occurs on the political spectrum light you know we saw tragically a year ago a crazed gunman\nComing to Washington DC or if the objective of shooting Republican Congress and and and ultimately go into the congressional baseball practice and and and shooting in nearly killing states relates to an end\nTo this should not be part of our political discourse disagreement is fine with even healthy to disagree on policy issues ah but but violence has no place it in and and and we need to be able to disagree with each other\nOr with civility prospect\nNow Senator Cruz you are cruising and that's great we need to back in D.C just a final question to you about the Supreme Court which is now the thirty Years' War for the court is over at least for a time we\nHave five conservative I Would argue originalist judges there we regret we get two or three more regret twenty nine appeals court judges and fifty district court judge how important is it that the Republicans keep the Senate and this is about more ethnic selling Arizona yeah Mike brought in Indiana and Josh Hawley Missouri how important is it that the Republicans\nMaintain their control of the United
