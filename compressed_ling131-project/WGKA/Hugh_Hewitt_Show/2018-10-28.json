{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "And directs all things to their appointed in in reading that against the backdrop of where we are for example in our nation today\nAnd a lot of Christians are struggling with his God lost control of his world and all of our own nation how do you react to that\nWhile I think that um at without being unkind to any of them or they would do better too I read the Bible is a little more and watch\nThe TV a little less ... because that way that frame work and a point of reference would then be constrained far more by a conviction about the fact that a Jesus as an ascended king\nThat nothing is out of control or even if it seems like it's out of control that the lord God I'm an epitaph rains and um you know it's understandable that when all around our soul gives way or that we would be casting about it but\nIt said knows points that we actually then discover that kind of theological underpinnings that we have or that we don't have\nHow necessary was that for Joseph to experience all the suffering the betrayal the injustice that you are describing that we nose in scripture oh one useful purposes could that have served for him and if so is any of that applicable to us in our struggles\nWell you know one of the things about the doctrine of Providence is that we have to remember that\nYou know God is always working together in in a variety of circumstances\nYou know so if for example Joseph says why is this happening or you know when he finds himself in the pet well the answer to that question is not in this for him to focus on the this is understandable but it's not it's not the answer\nA similarly if he says you know why is this going on in my life or why is this happening to me\nIn actual fact what is happening to Joseph is not ultimately about what God is doing with Joseph but rather about what good is doing in the lives of other people who are around Joseph and\nSo it it it actually is it's helpful reminder to as that God is much bigger than our circumstances and that he's at work in a variety of of not only circumstances but in a variety of consequences for example in the story of the actually the Apollo swear\nAt the Holy Spirit is said to forbid them from a going out onto the next part of their plan journey and the response to that is frustration\nBut in actual fact the result of that is that the gospel then comes to Europe and moved from Asia to Europe\nThe latter part of the book uh Alister you make the point of forgiveness how in ...\nAnd was it not just for his brothers but even for Joseph maybe especially for Joseph that he could find a heart to forgive them\nYeah I mean absolutely crucial because without without that reconciliation then the story would be\nWould just be hanging by by a thread wouldn't that\nUm but in actual fact uh the reconciliation that took place a took place at through all these various circumstances and that uh the alienation between him and his brothers and all of a jealousy that was represented in it\nAh makes that great a conclusion of it just absolutely remarkable and particularly that Joseph is the one who takes the initiative and that Joseph has all of the power\nTo to respond to his brothers in kind he could have had them in prison he could have dealt with them to speak up late and said you know this is what you did to me and that is what I Will do to you\nAnd then that you see it's one of the great pictures in a Joseph is one of the pictures in the Bible that point it has forward or to the Lord Jesus Christ himself\nWho uh was humiliated before any busy exalted and ah who threw his sacrifice provides you know salvation who was brought down in order that he might be brought back up again and what the father is doing with Joseph is what he actually does\nWith Jesus or you know at the justice says to his brother's he says you intended for evil but God intended it for good\nWhich is exactly what is the case when you think about the death of Jesus that the\nReligious authorities intended it for evil but in that great moment of intended evil God was working the salvation of men and women it said it really is truly remarkable picture and a reminder to us that God is much bigger than us\nAnd is it not true also pastor that the higher God may want to live any one of us up you've got to understand that he's going to first have to take us down in much similar way am I right\nWell it's often a patch on this and that that uh that he breaks has before he makes us and uh he reduces I say and and of course the encouragement of scripture is that you know they either how most himself will be insulted but he ... himself will be a based\nAnd um so yes I think many of us have learned a more of God's Providence in God's care through um disappointment and peers rather than through you know success and laughter\nA sign that says I was pushed\nBy and falling\nBut the lord how many\nMore

C. ... says this is almost as it seems praised in time in which the oppression of a Syria arrested heavily upon the kingdom of the freedom and Judah sought self threatened with ruin when this boulevard show to follow\nUs up to a gym that's the Greek translation of the Old Testament seems to endorse this at least in the judgment of those translators because like ... Seventy six of adds to the title song concerning the Syrian or they have that\nNow\nThis striking feature of this ... fit in and around the chorus as I've just mentioned is that it has to great images for the God of Israel the first one is the image of God is Israel's shepherd develop very briefly and versus one and two\nAnd then the second images that God is the plants are and the caretaker of a vineyard which stands for Israel and its developed and that long third stanza that I was talking about\nNow\nIs the first image somebody's have gone to shepherd is one of\nWays the Bible has frequently talking\nAbout God we can understand that because the Old Testament was written for a pastoral people most people kept animals understood very well on a shepherd was and how much work it was a way we're sheep were\nAnd saw a wedding uh Osama speaker other passages in the Bible speak about God being a shepherd all those people would understand that right away\nI think it may be helpful when we talk about this image of God a shepherd the know that the earliest reference the goddess a shepherd is vi Jacob Abrahams grams on and you find a way back in the book of genesis and the forty eighth chapter\nEric Jacobs speak some God is the one who has been my shepherd all my life to this day the angel who delivered me from all harm reason that it was so interesting is the Jacob himself was a shepherd\nAnd it was a difficult job and he describes it in one place to recall that when he ran away from his uncle late than taking the flocks and the daughters that we're now is wives leaving pursue them\nThey could was not a very talkative person seems to have been retiring and put up with a lot it was shy but he was promoted to at this time and he spoke up and he said\nI shepherded your flock for Twenty years and uh it kept me awake at night and I had to be there and the heat of the\nAnd the sun and it was cold at night and\nIf God hadn't taken care of me or to send me away with nothing that was the shepherds watched so when he said God is my shepherd he understood what he was talking about\nI learned something else too and\nJacobs use of the um age yet learned that he wasn't able to shepherd himself\nOtherwise he wasn't able to run his own life he thought he could at one time they thought he could make his own plans he was rather ... God I can get by with my wits when he discovered it didn't work out that way and what he needed was God as a shepherd now that's absolutely the same with us\nAnd his waiver days I Know Jacob ... knowledge God he ran away from home and his brother was threatening to kill him and let God and that's all they said this God she'll be my God\nPut it in contemporary terms of you and said to him or you're a Christian he would have guards said yes my study was living his own way and the wonderful thing of this and see what's he's testifying too at the end of his life is even though he was way we're like a waiver shape God nevertheless didn't cease to be a shepherd\nSo and we take the image and apply it Israel always say God has a shepherd of Israel\nEven though they are way we're not as our shepherd even though\nWe're way where it is a good thing is\n\nOughta say however according to a song that although God has introduced as the shepherd of Israel this doesn't mean what we've I think of as a shepherd\nThat is young David out there a boy in the field gentle almost helpless doomed to take care of shapes something like that\nSong says is that the shepherd of Israel is nevertheless the one who sits in throne between the chair of him\nAll that is either\nWere on the lid of the arc of the covenant and the most holy place of the\nTabernacle or its thinking of the Caribbean and have them because there are passages that referred to that in the picture on earth is only a symbol of what was understood to be an haven't but whether it's on earth are and how is saying the shepherd has the mighty wind of Israel\nThis is gone and we are talking about it was truly as a shepherd's care but he does it with a sovereign might and that's the basis of the appeal appeal says awaken your might come and save us first to\nFile the first time the recurring chorus appears as inverse three on his immediate like after this a field of the great might of Israel shepherd and what it says is is restore us oh God make your face shined upon us almost undoubtedly a reference to the ironic blessing\nI suppose the salt must must have heard that a thousand times ten thousand times baby and so when it comes to\nWrite the song Mrs natural language to him\nI suppose because that idea of seeing God's face has greater over ... was that he may also I've been thinking of it even greater blessing than that you know the great desire other people have gone down through the Old Testament period was to see the face of God I say we see your handiwork in nature and we marvel at that\nWe see your power demonstrated in history and your protection I was as a people but we most long forties you we want to see you and we want to see your face to face Moses made that request and\nThirty third chapter of exodus he says now show me your glory you meant you\nWanted to see the face of God and godsend I'll I'll put you in a collector the lockout passed by you'll see my power am I might but you can't see my face because no one can see my face and live\nWell that's great that's than they have ... people and desire theologians call it to be a tipping vision see the face of God you know maybe at a certain sense as watch is almost is talking about as well\nI'll let me say something your buddies asking for here is a God might be favorable and if this solemn as written before the fall of the northern kingdom as it seems to be then we know that God did not smile favorably upon the people and save the kingdom and we know the reason why\nBecause as soon as the people that I made it very clear they weren't repenting of sin so we saw him as a warning among other things that restoration is not automatic\nBecause God is the shepherd doesn't mean that he doesn't punish the shape and so here we have a warning when you're ... oh God make your face shine upon us it must be accompanied by repentance for our transgressions\nFound a second ... of this song following the chorus versus four or five and six is a description of Israel's president plight the trouble is there an it's an explanation of why the nation\nIt needs to be restored and the reason that very clearly is a God is angry and his angry as seen in the fact that he has allowed the enemies to comment upon them to crash upon them but this is saying of course is a sin has consequences\nCensus speaks at least two he's consequences that's doing it in poetic language what it says is the essence says that the people that have been made to eat and drink tears and that they have become tolerant of their enemies\nAnd we have a very good example of this from this time not from the north I think this is about the northern kingdom but it's the same kind of example we find it in the south so ...\nKing and come up a against the southern kicking dummy had surrounding Jerusalem and has the ... was the king's sent a\nMessage to has a ... of the message was this you find it in

suffering that one is glory she'll be reviewed you may be glad also with\nExceeding jaw it'd be reproach by the name of Christ happy arguing all the spirit of glory in a God rest of the bond you four times and those two verses he talks about jaw\nPersecution can't take your jaw it increases your jaw praise the Lord Jesus said\nRejoice envy exceeding\nGlass now the second thing\nNot only rejoice but review look if it wasn't\nVersus Seventeen and Eighteen for time has come the judgment must be getting the house of God and at first began to watch all the envy of them that will be not the gospel of God has a righteous scarcely be said we're actually ungodly in the center of the second thing is to\nReview your life or you suffering Connolly is it because of something\nThat you've done that you've suffered judgment again\nThe house of God it is for Chrysler enjoy sport carnal reasons repair\nSo every\nTime suffering comes not only should I rejoice but I should review I should look at my judgment again thousands\nBird rely rely look if you ... where for let them suffer according to the will of God ... the keeping of\nTheir souls to him in well doing as onto a fateful creator when you review and you find out that\nMy suffering as one of the calls across then just rely on him brand is not your problem and it's a problem\nAnd that word commit that word commit is an interesting word

giving they're fleeing theoretically the persecution this may be a first in history where the country are fleeing persecution from you more with their flag\nRight right I said I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt disgraceful way turned back Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany\nThey weren't not waving Nazi flags and singing\nGerman nationalist songs and talking about how they were going to transform English us in the U.S and Germany damage I mean that the people are mixing up the Jewish refugees from Germany with the German American button you know\nUm these people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by their governments there they're just living in kinda crappy countries\nYou know and those countries are crappy for a reason uh for historical and cultural and political reasons because they never embraced ordered liberty they um they ... they inherited a bad dictatorial political culture from Spain\nUh whereas we inherited a kind of anti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England\nAnd as a result they have worse government's worse economies they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things there's a great Latin American economists her ... her and I think his name is Fernando ... or ... ... I think it's ...\nSoto was found out\nThis photo and he said if you enforce property rights or the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from thugs and from drug drug lords Latin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence of it\nThey were fleeing to America and we have a huge welfare magnet a lot of these people even if they ... they come in and start working their kids will grow up probably on public assistance large percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away refugees get a get a whole honey pot full of benefits from the government\nOh so what do you think is going to happen when they reach the American border\nWell my hope is that we will have the U.S military lined up and choking off the entire border and I think President Trump's ... he's already said this is a national emergency he should start using defense funds to start constructing the wall\nYou ought to lay the he ought to lay the cornerstone of the wall gold plated with the big tea on at a\nAnd start building the wall and led Congress scream and yell led judges scream and yell and he should for their court orders and continue to use as authorities commander in chief to seal the border and ... and take money away from a guarding Afghanistan's\nBorder if necessary to guard at the United states sport or that's what we elected him for we didn't like Jeb\nBush we didn't elect Nikki Haley we elected Donald Trump because we wanted to put America First ah if we're going to be global policemen you know a charity begins at home\nAnd there's a crucial point I think because the sick people feel a sense of moral moral ambivalence\nAll these people they just want to improve their lives okay first of all that is true of half the world if you are going to say that you if you pick up in Honduras and say this sucks I'm outta here\nI'm going to the U.

consider them as disgusting as their side there are some people are shouting Nancy Pelosi which I'm not for by the way\nThis is this is the new rules but there are no rules that's the whole point they the the only rules with a west of the ones the less water pass [noise]\nLike you you must allow a male who considers himself to be a female to run in the women's race this narcissistic did this last week and it's amazing it goes on comment that out in the United states men or women\nI get questions from the people in a church or civic organizations or our friends sitting around you know of a fire pit next to the lake or whatever\nUh so uh I just kind of gather them up and then uh you know about twice a year will be one of these shows and\nAnd just kind of start answering some of these questions so I Would encourage you that are listening if you have specific questions if you'd like to ask just um you know email them to us our email address is mark at master plan retire dot com that comes directly to my desk\nAnd uh I Will collect them and uh I may even start answering one question a week on the radio show if we get started getting good float questions so\nUh we always want to be a above board and make sure we get your questions answered with no um element of what it means to us in other words when I answer questions is not to try to get you as a client we have lots of clients I Am not suffering for clients we are are very busy\nUm in fact over the next few years we're going to cut down on how many class we take on already we only take on a limited number of folks so\nReally the radio show and the people we meet with from the radio show starts out is just how can we help you and and can we get some questions answered can get you in the right direction and then later on if we find is a good match then we will you know send together and go from there but\nUh just want to get your questions answered and see if we help yeah when it comes to planning for that important segment of life\nRetirement and it could accomplish about a third of your life so I'm a very important that you plan ahead and not just fly by the seat\nYour pants are skirt or dress or skis our shorts or whatever it is you may be wearing\nAt this particular time so ah so let's get right into the mail bag here so the question I get most often are probably answer this on several of these shows but as a basically a mark I read an article I read many articles that say I should wait\nBefore I take Social Security I should wait till eight Seventy which is the latest you can take it\nTechnically you can take it later but you lose out a because it doesn't increase or anything else so you should take it by Seventy so should you wait and my favorite answer as many of you that have listened before no is it depends it depends on your situation so think about this first of all if your sixty two\nAnd you want to stop working and you want to start retiring um then that's eight years without a Social Security check\nSo that's giving up maybe thirty thousand dollars a year for eight years in my book that's about a quarter of million dollars so should you do that\nWell the good news is if you do weighed eight years you're going to probably come close to doubling your Social Security payments\nSo that would be a great thing but in the meantime you've had to come up with a quarter million dollars to retire own for those eight years was that a good thing well again it depends because it depends on what kind of assets you have a depends on where it's located where those assets are how they're growing how their ... are protected if you\nAre drawing out thirty thousand a year and the market drop spot thirty percent uh then you're going to dig into your principles severely so that's not good so needs to be in a place that's somewhat protected\nOr so really the answer is it every situation is different don't let these magazine and emailed articles push you into making a decision um because that's what they say ... remember what I call them you know what I call this this information\nWe call that investor pornography and stuff that's just put out there just sell newspapers to sell\nEmail adds to sell whatever and they're trying to reach a big audience and so how do you reach a big audience you answer a big question with one big answer and then you try to explain it uh from that standpoint so get help with this answer this is not something that\nUh most of you can figure out on your own not that you don't have the capability but you don't have the experience expertise information in software that will help you do this so\nI Would encourage you to sit down with somebody that does retirement planning and creates a retirement plan and come up with a your date of when you started if you're married\nUh your spouse's date very likely could be different there are ways that you can take one early one light and a further maximize your Social Security so this is not a a cut and dried answer um that that we can just say yes to take it at age sixty seven and a half\nThat would be ridiculous yet that's what they keep telling us and all these articles so\nShould you wait it depends ah so that's our first question number two this is one I always get\nAnd that is do I have a enough money to retire out or how do I decide how much money I Need to reach our own and so there's a lot of old rules out there and maybe we'll dig into a couple of them later in today's show 'em but you know the question is is I'm\nA is really again based on you and your situation you know do you know it it takes us to meetings to figure out\nIn many cases if somebody has enough money to retire on how to increase that money how to maximize returns how to protect segments of it things like that\nSo just saying yes if you you know if you're at this age and you have this much money you need one million dollars to retire on either of pilots come dressed recently and\nAnd his old advisor it said that he did not have enough that he needed another million dollars will but by the time we got through a with the planning because of the way we play and were able to squeeze\nA lot more a juice out of the out of the lemon and by the time we finished he was he could retire today um and so um it there's there's no set number but we do have again here at our office\nThe means and the capabilities of or being able to decide and look at your situation here's an years alone and being able to tell you\nIf you have enough to retire around and if not how can we come up or heck we maximize or how can we fix that so um it's kind of story I tell back for years and years I saw uh my family doctor and he was a general practitioner a good friend I went to church with him at one point he was my son is schoolteacher\nAnd all that good stuff and I'm so one day when I got in a close to her into my fifties I went to them I said I'm I'm going to make up a name here listening John I I'm I'm\nTurning fifty and and I need I'm going to have to make a change I'm going to be looking for in your doctor and he was you know just our gas to know why what's going on what's done wrong and all this kind of a sudden you've not done anything wrong you've done a great job of keeping me healthy during my ah middle years\nBut things change when you age and many of us started looking for these these internal specialist and and doctors that deal with\nAh people age fifty an older and all these different tests and different diseases an aging and memory loss and and and um
