tomorrow yes or no\n[noise] oh boy that was different than the question I I thought you're going to ask you I Believe he should be [laughter] oh is that you know you just asked me whether you are not you think he's going to be yeah those two different things yeah which one is it\nDo you think he's going to be confirmed that today everyone I\nThink he's going in for a man and that was going to have a vote today yes or no if I had to vote today yes I Would vote for okay now here's why he's going to be confirmed I don't know\nYeah see that's that's an interesting question Anderson people that are saying I've even had some uh with like for example we just heard from Jim in St Pete he gave me a no and he said because he can't trust the uh the rhinos up there to do what they need to do and there may be some truth to that but I'm telling you that if they vote\nYes I mean yeah I I don't trust them either I mean I don't think I'm not I'm not sure that I might have to vote on yes of course\n[noise] okay well let's talk about that for a second because you saw what happened yesterday with all the protesters who got arrested for just literally getting way out of control in the Senate office building there\n[laughter] on and so on I ... that that happens is has been going on and you get your little rent a mobs ... you get people I don't know some people in this country don't have jobs you got all these people out there that are protesting what do they do for a living there getting pounded either\nYeah it's kinda I I mean it's it's absurd you know the people that are actually worked for a living that are out there are things that we don't have time to go to Washington DC take time off work\nAnd ransacked ... a a a Senate office building sorry\nYeah by the way um there was an ad that were sent to me yesterday of from Miami or remember with Hillary was down here with a Gillum last week you heard about that\n[noise] um I didn't I didn't hear the Hillary was they're surprised he hadn't camping with her\n... yeah she was there at a at a place where he was at ... supposedly coming but there was an ad that somebody sent me they were looking for movie extra supplied to such and such an address to being a movie well it was a movie alright it was a Facebook YouTube saying and uh it was the Hillary Clinton event blade seven hundred and fifty people show a port\nThoughts it oh yeah uh it Obama's opponent either just goes to show you um but yeah I mean you got sorrow sent his groups there with these rent a mobs and you know put this stuff on TV but people see it for what it is\nI mean they they they recognize that okay you're you're dragging all these people up um and she was going on in the last three oh I think protest major protest\nUm either she yet the one\nWhen I drank a lot of people after Donald Trump was inaugurated was also the anti war protests in New York City in the run up to the Iraq War where that was that was I think you know that that was a lot of people that was on a weekend people had often were involved in that but these things are ...\nYeah you're you're absolutely correct and or the other thing is the thing that we saw going on\nWas you know quite an example of well it's an example of civil liberties much unfortunately when you get out there and you start to act to the point to where it's confrontational and you're threatening violence and all this sort of stuff that's when it gets out of hand\nWell who's going to listen if you if you're yelling and screaming in their faces and you don't want to have any sort of conversation I'm you know who's going to listen you\nHer mouth intact you want to have a conversation with them like your point I was like you might point them can have a discussion about it fine uh that's that's how you're republics are supposed to thrive uh we're getting away from that um if you don't agree with a someone's belief system you're somehow\nOr your all your many you can be one of many things you could be a racist you could be a home of all you could be anti woman you're gonna be all sorts of things as long as you don't agree with the way that these people think and that's a shame\nNow what did you say about the Senate building when I said why or how come we're letting all these people in the building to roam around the what did you say something or that there was that during the break when you were talking we're not we're talking\nOh you and I are talking about that during the break\nYeah well what do you think about that I mean uh right now because it's where the people's business is done that the ... the building is open for people to come in and out of but certainly there's gotta be some sort of security check or something right\n[noise] oh I ... I mean I'm sure that there is a security check it out you're not sure they have a a metal detectors and whatnot and you know you've got to check your your your bags and whatnot on your way in\nUm I I don't think the scotch anybody just walk in there and roam around without being checked I like walking into a courthouse or you know your local town hall in today's day and age there got airport detectors\nUh but you know the the reality is is that you know as long as you're not giving any any violent type of acts I get that you know not barren dating doors or doing anything that that's the case that you know you need to be remote\nEyes trying to remember the last time I was up there a and it was during it was post ah let's see was post nine eleven\nAnd I had to have an appointment which I did to see the people that I had to see their which I I I was doing a but they searched me they had the metal detector the whole nine yards and without the appointment I Would not have gotten you know I think they changed all that again\nI I I don't know whether that's if the Senate there might be different rules to the Senate\nAh I'm was a house for the house and he was going on the house is different now\nThan than both I'm not sure exactly how it works um ... and yeah you you know one would assume that you're going to be your congressman history should be able to leave your Congress older probably than they can afford it\nBy the way Gary down in summer field is saying or get married on some feel Gary down in Sarasota is saying a big shout out to you and a big yes for the answer\n[laughter] it was that I mean like I said I I I I Hope I Hope he does I think it's important you know you know why\n... these judicial nominees are looked at what just happened in California where you had that crazy judge reject or that you know Trump deporting three hundred thousand people and and now you're going to have to feel it again you get these people that that you know was set up Trump must be racist that's wise or in the old so I'm gonna\nI'm gonna put a temporary restraining order insane judges like that is what on says\nOkay I'm going to let you go because the ten minutes you're going to be on the radio on search in eighty them is I have a good one\nTo have a great weekend I Chris Marcus their buddy the watchdog in Wall Street catch them over there and her sister station Thirteen eight in the biz now\nLet me tell you folks about the brand new Nissan tightened five point six a leader three hundred Ninety horse power V.

I ran into a wall of a difference from the fraternity her sorority the big university this was before me too\nI've never been so frustrated and angry at the indifference to assault so I Am genuinely open to anyone coming forward with an assault allegation we have to believe and due process we have to\nUh I I agree with you quickly and the ... argument of framing it as a job interview and saying well we don't have any and the irony is that I have a little boy and he got accused of bullying a little girl last year so much so that she was going to change\nAnd of course they sound like it was about fair play and due process I did what any good mother with you I lost my mind on my son and then I started looking at the end of that\nAnd I started I actually called the first time on that I I

he should be confirmed today\nA morning whew I Am Atticus [laughter]\nAt Atticus Finch that this is I I think this is a a an amazing thing he should be confirmed that he will be confirmed\nA I think it's falling into place with this whole episode I think is an amazing in revealing moment in our history that has drawn us back to a much larger debate about the nature of our country\nAnd behind that uh the ... the history and the standing of his western concept of the rule of law\nAnd I think this is a key moment that is now risen beyond Kavanaugh he's become a movement in a way about this representation of this idea and this has been engaged um\nAnd so let me let me give you the background met your calling in the middle of a\nWhile to show I have spoken to Meredith in Los Angeles Lucy in New York county in San Antonio Debbie in Dallas Margaret in Hawaii Iranian Saratoga Jenna inventing Kevin Illinois a truck driver seven kids the widow Cindy in San Antonio paralegal two boys Janet St Petersburg well let's say Dallas Beth and Michigan ... soldiers\nSon deployed now Kelly in Virginia former sex crimes\nProsecutor came in Columbus Sally in LA pan\nAnd Delaware psychiatrist Renee in Pittsburgh\nPenny in Virginia and Melissa and Winchester Michelle and the great by Texas Myron palace British\nCount Carol in Wisconsin Helen in Philadelphia Marlene tip 'em all listen Detroit calling in Pittsburgh they all want Brett Kavanaugh confirmed most of them are furious at his treatment and they have not been represented in the media\n[noise] no I think that's right I mean it to which I was going to add ... you know my my ... my sister in law down in Fredericksburg people I've talked to ... this is an amazing thing and I think that uh you know the the the initial push of this and raising it the way it was the last minute strike\nBut then it's gotten to the point where there's now a a pushback from that is more and more people got involved and are thinking about this as um as parents\nAs siblings I'm as moms have sons or it's just it's just an amazing moment when people realize that that's what I meant in the sense that this oddly ... I Know we've got hose this way people are seeing it at a very clear in stark way\nBut this really is a moment in which a principal a core fundamental principle has become exposed in a way that the demands a fundamental reaction\nAnd that is a point about fairness I I was in a cab the other day coming in from Virginia and I got it I like to talk to my cabbies and I did not expect this conversation to go to the right way I was just chit chatting Kavanaugh came on the radio\nHe asked me what I thought about it well what do you think about it\nAnd he and he looked at me straight\nThat this is unfair this man is being mistreated and it's on fair I think there's a natural way which which uh other human beings\nGet this which does go to the root of what it means to be a self governing country and establishment of the rule of law rather than the rule of arbitrary men\nAnd about something that's called due process a process to which we are do according to the law because we're all created equal and we have an opportunity to be innocent before we're proven guilty goes to the heart of all those things and you're seeing that reaction in common ordinary solid American people\nThere is a story today and the wall Street Journal that a friend of Dr Ford dumped pressure to revisit her statement ah one that would indicate\nManipulation of witnesses there is an art in these twenty six color is a fundamental distrust of Dr Ford's um appearance not her testimony on her but that this was a manipulative process uh what do you do hear the same thing [noise]\nI think I'm a part of this is is is I think the American people are a good compassionate people and they're trying to grapple with this question they don't want to they don't want to question a her they don't want to question her I'm a real passion and and that moment\nUh I think a lot of them see her as a victim as well she she well might have been been the I'm a victim of of harsh treatment or many cases are but it is that there's there's no evidence here so how do you weigh these things\nAnd and I think ... their reaction is is that as more and more comes out there's manipulation going on here it seems that her own counsel does not share information with her the story itself is really falling apart I'm\n... and I think this is a a reaction to that are about ... and then people\nHad to put their heads down because they knew the honesty that he was saying we did not happen ... he did not do that and when his when he talked about his daughter praying for Dr Ford\nWe we both I mean what a great family and what a great way to raise children and to to pay for her is is truly are threats\nAnd criticism and getting Michigan thank y'all be right back with Dr Matthew Spaulding is the Hillsdale dialogue
