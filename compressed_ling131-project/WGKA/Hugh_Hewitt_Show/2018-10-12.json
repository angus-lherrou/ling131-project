D watchdog 'em all strangest was good morning\nMorning here's my question of the week you're ready ready Mitch\nMcConnell just got Fifteen\nOr judges improved yesterday by the Senate you've not heard anybody talk about it because God Forbid if we knew about that one but this is a record for the G O P question is are you happy with the job Mitch McConnell is done his Senate majority leader yes or no\nOr or uh you know if I'm going to say I'm a happy not ... I Know\nOkay so you're not you're not alone your number let's see your number five ten Fifteen number Eighteen I've got forty two yes an Eighteen knows\nIt it it's hard for me it's hard for me to be thrilled with Congress is great got\nTwo Supreme Court justice and I know we play to deal with Chuck Schumer yesterday that say okay you guys can go home and campaign as long as you get these Fifteen\nThrough I I I get all that but let's be honest um we've got government spending that's out of control and Republicans if if there was a Democrat in the White House right now that would be jumping up and down when it comes to spending we get in charge and you know what you spend like crazy\nUh they didn't get Obamacare repealed and that's what everybody ran on and they weren't able to pull that off a again that way and that you know use of the leadership and the Senate you know he should have figure out a way to make that happen didn't\nSo now I mean I I don't think he did that great of a job and then he has his moments yet his moments are kind of like you I manning has his moments now but the records wanted five\nWell we're about to spend more money because unfortunately hurricane Michael came to Florida and\nIn the panhandle section a lot of uh some very expensive or a new modern homes were damaged a whole bunch of the older buildings destroyed we now have seven people are confirmed dead or by the most powerful storm to hit the Florida Panhandle ever\nAnd we now have three hundred you heard me right three hundred people missing\nA lot of money coming from insurance I mean it is what it is I mean you've got to be getting insurance pay for this uh ... believe it or not people don't realize is that I talked about this briefly yesterday it's going to hit actually a lot of pension funds hedge funds by these things called catastrophe bugs they do where they get paid\nA when there's no catastrophe but you know God Forbid when something like this happens ah yeah they're going to end up having to pay out they're gonna end up losing their investment but you know insurance is going to cover all a lot of this and I get that obviously the federal government sets money aside\nFor natural disasters that it's going to be I guess I won't worried about that you are that's discretionary type spending ... and that that's the just the you know small part of what's going on even though that needs to be reined in the reality is is that you know we've got to start taking a look at it I mentioned the growth of a title much\nUh to get that under control because in the budget she just bust\nThat now let me talk about what I saw yesterday on the interstate because I took a little short John on the interstate I Seventy five a for about Fifteen miles and it was a ... hour north of Home Depot trucks and on the Home Depot trucks I saw lots of plywood\nLots of two by fours I saw a bunch of Ryder rental straight trucks in the convoy that was going north so I'm assuming\nThat that was to make temporary repairs I'm assuming similar\nThey had the blue tarps which are famous for when they put them up on roasted get damaged because the houses that have rubs don't have much of a rough and of course that's what they'll be doing the reporting to both types up there\nYeah I I see that um the ... that you know they're going to try to I mean\nI we we had that happen you know you Hurricane Sandy here in New York area\nBelieve it or not there's still some areas on Long Island that that have been there yet and here in Brooklyn or whatever reason it may be ... um I I I'd never seen anything like this in my life I mean I have it if it I mean you're going to have to bulldoze entire neighborhoods or you know why you really are\nYou know why this this was a similar to Hurricane Andrew you remember that years ago on Nineteen Ninety two when they had a strong it was almost as powerful this one here Michael was within two miles an hour of being a cat five and that would have been the same thing as Hurricane Andrew they had ... to one Seventy three miles\nPer hour yeah it it just looks like it's just that you're going to have to rebuild entire neighborhoods and it should be\nMore pop out of town as a ... degree down just yeah\nTowns there I mean it's just it's that bad and you know we've got to come to that realization and it's going to need to be rebuilt you know I talked about this uh on my program and I can get a ... ... what we should be praying for for these people\nAs paying for pay for them to be the word is is it's a you know I didn't coined the word it's called anti fragile resilient but anti fragile learn that you know what you're going to take this debt\nAnd you're going to grow from it and it's going to make you stronger now Brazilian resent will stay stay well you've got to become stronger from this\nBefore I let you go I'm going to read you a little a text here that I got from Wayne in his family he told me not to mention his last name and I'm not he's one of our suicide jockeys those are the guys would hold up the gasoline\nAnd diesel and whatnot back and forth and he he works for a company that operates between Pensacola in Jacksonville\nHe goes up to Bainbridge, Georgia gets his gasoline and whatnot and then delivers it along that stretch and he said to me just kept and because of you and because of what I heard the morning of the storm had three o'clock in the morning telling us to get out of the area\nThat this was nothing to take a lightly didn't to just get out of the path of the storm I told my wife and my children to get in the car and go west\nAnd go north and they went west and they went ... and ... going up into Montgomery, Alabama where they're okay\nAnd I joined them up there now I parked my truck and I met them on the interstate a in Pensacola and we continue to our trip but because of you were alive and we just came back to see our houses was late yesterday and he said we have no house\nOr something that is just you know again it's hard for ... and most all of us to even consider you know your wedding pictures of his family heirlooms on you know the the mentality that you have\nTo put down in that situation is not ... you have to have no choice you cannot adapt not uh what was this you know why did this happen to happen I may think terrible things happen to good people you know that's that's just life is how did you go about dealing with these things and that's what's going to find you and that's what's going to find this area\nAnd you can feel free to use ... name on your show because that's something where the power of radio that one time that one person and maybe there are others who hated the warning that we put out there and save their life\nYeah you have to get take things seriously and again you know what you need to be praying for these people spraying for them or that the anti fragile\nAll right well have a good weekend take care and no one sees your team playing this week no they already played\nAnd yeah it's not good we need we need a quarterback she needed a new coach there they're even talking about bringing a cap or they can never hear that oh God\nDon't do that All right well Thanks Chris ... to the giants\nGive me a break anyway uh everybody like taking ... and making them the head coach of the Tennessee Titans are you go so uh and he's looking over there he hasn't heard me yet but anyway that's our producer that's getting ready to produce Christmas show 'em Hey Chris will be on Thirteen ... Thirteen eighty to ... years and I go\nGlory America from inside the beltway phrase guy Francis has accepted the resignation Donald Wuerl has gone from DC that's good news that is great news for a day that just the devastation up and down the\nPanhandle of Florida that you just can't believe until you see the video\nAnd courage to go visit ... Khan usa dot org and be generous chamber of accounting usa dot org yesterday at eleven o'clock I went to the White House kind of crazy ... Jim Brown where they're at the same time but I was over in the oldie obey I sat down with our national security advisor bachelor John Bolton and here's the conversation we had\n... thanks for talking to me it's good to see you if you're glad to be what hit a is preparing your entire life for this job and you were right with the most disruptive president says Andrew Jackson in the world or to that is collapsing the job of what you thought it wouldn't be given all the years that you've studied the ad I say\nWell I think it's a it's a it's a job that really gives you an opportunity to serve the president or who's who's in office in every president has a different style\nOr I think good job of the national security advisor really is to make sure that whatever the style of the president that he gets the information he needs to make decisions or that he has the range of options that he needs and then that those decisions are carried out\nSo that's my job I think it's fine that we've got a disruptive president even a kind of chaotic world because there are a lot of changes that need to be made\nA we're seeing a lot to do bills come do from the Obama administration so it's very fast paced uh but uh I wouldn't trade it for anything else\nLet me ask you about your own job since it's now in the United nation Nasser you're right it makes the president twofold what kind of personality and should this be a job in the cabinet Russia is not a cat it\nWell you know on the second one it's really up to the president or he can make any job a cabinet rank and he'll make his decision a as he sees as best\nI ... I did not have cabinet rank uh when I was ... I don't think it affected me in any way either up to the UN or in my dealings within the administration\nI think it's a job where you have to be prepared to get deep into the substance of issues I think it's very important in implementing policy and mostly what you do at the un has implement policy that you understand the significance of the actions you're taking\nA and it'd be part of a team I I felt very privileged when I was there I helped make policy but I help mostly to carry policy out\nSome national security advisers travel a lot some stay close to the oval office what's your travel schedule like looking forward especially between now and election\nWell I've spent most of my time in Washington or or traveling with the president when he travels overseas or I have done some travel I've got a trip coming up to Moscow in the caucuses countries are in about ten days\nReason for that is to continue to carry through on the conversation that President Trump and present potent hadn't Helsinki during the summer to talk about U.S Russian relations and where we can make progress where we still have issues and disagreement or and then in the caucuses to see the very significant geographical\nA role that they have dealing with Iran dealing with Russia dealing with turkey so it's selected I worked very closely with Jim Madison I ... we had breakfast this morning as we do once a week to kick all these issues around and I think that's very important that the national security advisor I think under any presidential style\nHas to be an honest broker and I I work hard at that\nWhen you sit down with your counterpart Russia next week are you going to tell them hands off our election I may say three or four times loudly\nYeah well every time I've met with the Russians in this job including with President putting himself when I went to Russia to prepare for the Helsinki meeting I've made that point as has the president\nA is a message to believe that we're ... feet well\nSo far we don't see the kind of Russian meddling we did in twenty sixteen Chris Wray the director the FBI said the couple of weeks ago that that could change with the stroke of a K\nWe are very worried about the question of Chinese interference\nNot just in individual elections but more broadly trying to influence the American political discussion with an influence campaign that the I I think could well be unprecedented we heard vice president Pence speak to this issue a last week it was a very important speech I think people need to read it and consider it\nA and I think the United states needs to stand up frankly to any foreign government that thinks it's going to interfere in our politics we are a self governing people we will govern ourselves we don't need international institutions to tell us how to do it and we particularly don't need foreigners are trying to exert undue influence\nOver as well that transition to the story of the day ... we're trying to influence the response of the Saudi Government or the world at noon on Thursday are you satisfied with what the Saudis have told us about the disappearance of restrict ...\nWell I don't think we've we've known enough or I spoke with the crown prince yesterday along with Jared Kushner a secretary of state Mike Pompeo spoke to the crown prince says well the the president has spoken to this issue a it is something we need to get resolved and uh we need to do it as soon as possible\nIn the aftermath of the Annapolis newsroom shooting something people criticize the president or has the enemy of the people were in the aftermath of the shocking disappear and some people have said the president is turning a blind eye to violence against journalists\nAre across the world particularly in Russia where do you make a critic for the president trying to tie him to the show as\nWell I think this is ridiculous I mean I think this is a he has spoken out about it uh he's directed the secretary of state ... uh to speak with a ... a fiance and that'll happen as soon as they can get that scheduled a we're taking a number of other steps\nUh that I really can't get into at the moment\nBut I think that uh it's just a hypocritical to say that somehow the president's not concerned about these things when manifestly his words in his actions are to the contrary\nUh was from ... to Saudi Arabia and political structures at best convoluted is it possible we have a Henry the second situation who will get rid of this metal to appraise spiraling out of control or even something more and more level what that someone intended to undermine the crown prince and the king the this action\nYou know honestly we just don't know what the facts are and that was one of the points that are that I made to the crown prince\nOr we need to find out what the facts are and we need to get this resolved quickly because if it is a a a a another operation a people need to understand that I I think the the Saudis themselves are being damaged because we don't have the facts out\nThere is obviously been historical animosity between turkey and Saudi Arabia or we have our own difficulties with turkey at the moment with they're keeping pastor Brunson effectively under house arrest for no good reason whatever a so this is a this is not that anybody's benefit and it needs to be cleared up\nIs it possible that if the operation happen it could have happened without the knowledge of the crowd\nI think a lot of things are possible in the middle East I'm at the United states does not have information that's not revealing or if we had information wind or we know better exactly how to handle this we've made it clear we want to know what the facts are we are going to continue to do that\nLet me turn from our allies to our enemy or the commander the Iranian Revolutionary guards who am I going to use social media to threaten the White House there are reports that there are sleeper cells in the United states given those sorts of threats and those sorts of reports or American should we be alarmed about ... reach into the United states\nThink we should be I think the Iranian regime as an enemy of the United states are we just had a within the past ... on the arrest of two Iranian agents in the United states uh scoping out Jewish and Israeli targets for possible attack or\nYou seen France and other European countries arresting a agents of the Iranian intelligence service for planning an attack\nOn a rally of dissident Iranians in Paris this summer\nWe've seen transfer example now impose sanctions against Iran because of this behavior\nSo we see Iran or not a conforming to western norms because of the Iran nuclear deal they've not done anything to try to modify are concerned about their continued support for terrorism around the world they are accelerating this this regime\nIs a threat that's why the president\nOr got us out of the Iran nuclear deal that's why the economic sanctions or being re impose\nThat's why we're putting maximum pressure\nOn the Iranian regime and just to be clear we are having a very significant effect\nYou can hear the European governments talked about staying in the deal European corporations and I mean the biggest one the biggest oil companies the biggest manufacturing firms are getting out of Iran are Iranian oil exports are plummeting their currency has gone through the floor\nUnrest is spreading across the country even countries like China or reducing their imports of oil from Iran because they don't want to tangle with the United states\nUh this is something that we shouldn't be concerned about because Iran remains what it has been since Nineteen Seventy nine it's the world is leading state sponsor of tear at a press has its own citizens and it continues to pursue programs\nOf weapons of mass destruction nuclear chemical and biological this is a dangerous stayed in the region and a dangerous state worldwide and\nI like the fact that there was an alarm going down seventeenth street 'cause I talked to the national security adviser John Bolton I'll continue our conversation more of a coming up after the break remind you as well\nCompanies that portray themselves as the open Internet transparent future really you want to make money off of repression I if I were shareholder I'd I'd want to know what the answer of our corporate leadership was\nThe shareholders though we certainly would not have allowed him pre war Germany Americans to sell the crop iron works the design for new artillery are we is there a role for the government to step in and the Silicon Valley and controlled technology transfer\nWhen we were looking at the export the control area look we did this and continue to do it in terms of dual use technology that could affect nuclear chemical or biological weapons are ballistic missile development I think in cyberspace we're entitled to do the same thing\nThat because we've abandoned free market principles but because we have to be realistic about the adversaries we face in the world today that use the fruits of uh\nAnd freedom against us and we shouldn't let that happen we want to do in ways to protect our open economy but\nThe NIH others the ability to take advantage of it\nMore with John Bolton when we return America say candidates that your your show on

check or\nReturn to the previous administration and Bob Woodward's book a lot was overlook one thing that was overlooked with a candidate missions that they had to hit the scope of the north Korean nuclear problem\nFront of the country so that they were a further along I had the war and President Trump but that was his biggest problem didn't they in fact conceal the extent of the problem and we're we prepared for a preemptive strike the Woodward describes\nWell that the Obama policy they describe this strategic patience or that is a synonym for doing nothing about North Korea and it's another example of a do bill coming due for President Trump\nA I think the combination of the potential use of military force against North Korea and the maximum pressure\nCampaign that the president waged on the economic front is what has brought that Kim Jong onto the table Mike Pompeo has just returned from another trip there will see a meeting I think between a chairman Kevin President Trump's sometime in the next couple of months\nOr we'll see other efforts go forward the president has held the door open for North Korea he gave them a great little of the movie and er in Singapore when he met with\nKim Jong on that showed what North Korea's future could be so the doors open they need to denuclearize completely and reverse simply and if they do that and walk through the door of the future could be very different for the north Korean people\nNow John Holdren has been known for Twenty years is a little skeptical of skeptics a feel good diplomacy are you feeling good about the diplomacy with North Korea\nLook I don't think we'd be in the place we are today if we continue to pursue that Iraq Obama's policies I think four more years of that under Hillary Clinton would have guaranteed in North Korea with deliverable nuclear weapons\nOr the the future remains uncertain on the president's diplomacy he's optimistic he pressed his heart he does not have stars in his eyes

I never hear the when I I live in a sturdy thirty brick I never going to it and it felt like what in the world's going on out there I haven't gone out the ... the trees in the past and stuff like that yet but it was a minor tiny bit compared to what has just trash the panhandle and I am\nA I'm Amazed that um the\nOf damages not more significant in Georgia and South Carolina but it may just be that we haven't caught up with the drones yet it places but it never out or a gang come through this is maybe the most unique hurricane path\nThat uh we've ever seen and so not surprisingly in northern Virginia the or the Internet is coming and going and going and coming and it's not my studio just all of infinity trying\nIt's hard to be a backup and back down and we do it we can to make it work [noise] um the big news of the of the morning is that a\nPope Francis has accepted the resignation of Donna world and I just wanted to say a word about this the pope has clueless right I I'm a Roman Catholic I eventually go around the Catholic Presbyterian\nAnd so I'm In the church and also Presbyterian and I mean I'm a full except but like I go to\nSacramento reconciliation I received the elements I'm at math but I I Know my obligation than I Do it\nThey might be you know it all just lost my great good friends like Catholic mentor ... but I grew up in the Catholic they'll get it all and I'm very very careful about a year that just came back up here in the studio hopefully it'll be ... or so I'm very very careful about\nNot real scandal and the church in saying bad things about the pope I Believe this pope is isolated and clueless about the United states I think he carries an anti American\nSort of South America and Jane and ... and then he reflects anti American and therefore that lens seemed to be on the left when it comes to political disputes any tends to listen to the left wing hers is tended to listen to Donald Wuerl\nAnd Donald Wuerl ended ... characters that I'm not sure if that's true or not he's a criminal he's been the crime in his car go head has gone down a world got a nice send off a letter from the ... I cannot believe that\nThere is an attorney general in Pennsylvania Josh Shapiro he's a Democrat I'm In touch with them and they issued a grand jury report that is can closer and probing with Donald Wuerl covered up\nTerrible crimes terrible terrible crimes he covered them up he did not make them available to the national review board a moot priest around entered into in force of silences of victims it was awful what he did in Pittsburgh and then he got promoted\nBecause it covered up so effectively during the first round the scandal and now he's been found out by this grand jury report and disgraced again and revealed as a cover up guy\nNot himself a predator like mechanic but a cover up person predators enabler whether\nA person or a lot predators to move around and the pope sent a letter that says you made some mistakes but you're you didn't do anything terrible that's a paraphrase that to me America is a is a wholly inadequate and and genuinely terrible I'm\nGenuinely terrible result here and I feel bad for the church I'm sure it will recover but in the meantime at least he's gone and I hope that uh I really hope that you send someone\nThat is a ... a good person\nTo to hear now really factor dot com I got cut off beforehand I Want to make sure that everyone hears it today because it's one of those days if you got a Ninety eight nine the answer dot com I'm going to

much\n[noise] use [laughter]\nMorning\nGlory America tear your thank you for listening today and when rather just northern Virginia indeed Michael\n... roaring through Virginia I think down in Virginia Beach Norfolk Hampton Roads area it's a lot of power lines are down in center I'll keep you posted on that [laughter]\nI'm pleased to welcome the guy who would be in charge in Ohio were a disaster to happen next year for the next four years Mike DeWine he's the attorney general in Ohio right now he's running for governor in one of the most closely watched races in the United states former senator now attorney general DeWine welcome back to the euro ... great to have you\nHere it's great to be back with you and your listeners thank you very much\nOne of the things I think when we watch Michael come ashore governor a general DeWine is we listen to candidates and we think to ourselves are they\nAre they able to handle a crisis and you've been doing this a long time now but but speaking of Richard Cordray your your opponent has been a lawyer and a lawyer and he's been a lawyer or how about you [laughter]\nWell you know I've really tackle some tough problems and the interesting thing or if you compare Cordray and Mike DeWine is that we both\nAre were attorney generals and uh you know I beat him eight years ago close race but I but I beat him but what we inherited a was a real mess or the attorney general ... runs the state crime labs and when we took office a court right left us was if there was a\nA rape or serious crime that occurred in Ohio the unknown DNA was taken to the state crime lab\nA it would have sat there if you can believe this for a hundred and twenty five days without him by overlooking that that's how far a backlog of the hat and a quarter I left that mess and so we fixed it\nUh we turned cases around now a twenty four hours if it's an emergency uh we're doing four times as much DNA as we did today um he left office and you know our average times about three weeks but we can turn case around very very quickly and another thing that he couldn't bear\nCordray and what we've done now he left 'em and they were they were old rape get sitting and police departments all over the state of Ohio law states that had this problem or he didn't do anything about it when I became attorney general\nWe we started hearing about that and we actually have tested every single one of them we went out to all the police say bring it to us\nAh we want to get this evidence are tested and uh we've tested as I said close to fourteen thousand uh some as these were all cold cases old cases uh some of his some Fifteen Years old and we've got hit or matches in thirty six percent so we've gone back\nYou know in better than a third and told the the local police who then turned told the victim hey we get your ... or ...\nAnd in Cuyahoga County alone in Cleveland where we had a large large number of them\nAre they they have a indicted over seven hundred and fifty people rate while as a result of that so it it's it's a great lesson and you see a problem you go after it a quarter right just just sat there and didn't uh\nYou don't do anything and don't forget a course his time are heading up Obama's a consumer group out in Washington if you if you recall uh we we saw for\nExample or because of overregulation we ... we saw a number of our community banks or go down significantly in Ohio and I'm sure that occurred in in other states as well just because of the over over regulation or that their Cordray and others had in place\nNow I got to ask you a general DeWine the idea that Ohio which is doing well in this recovery I mean we've got I Know north eastern are pretty doggone well I Know Orenstein is cooking I Know that that's come country as well up in moaning and trauma county nice to be what county\nBut even in Cuyahoga County is cooking why in the world would we turn the state over to the left the uh the last I mean what in the world well the people they think about\nThat that look that's absolutely right we're we're we're doing well in Ohio a we do not want to go back to where we were eight years ago\nEight years ago when Cordray I'm a ... you know was was attorney general and a ... ... you know he was the attorney general state of Ohio we had\nHad lost a close to four hundred thousand jobs\nAh and you know we just were not moving our unemployment rate was high and the in the last eight years under Republican conservative leadership uh we've kept taxes down cut taxes\nUh we've seen the economy move forward and so you know what I Want to do my running mate John ... we want to take a while to the next level uh we've come a long long way we do not want to go back\nUh we've got we've got a couple of challenges out there we got an opiate problem that we we have to get in front of and now instead of a you know people are not being able to find jobs and not\nEconomy not moving forward our biggest challenge now for employers is to find people who are qualified or people who are able to pass a drug test so\nWhat we're really focusing on you is is two things uh one is tackling a drug problem we have a twelve point action plan that is makes makes real sense it's realistic uh some of the things I'm already shirt has already started to do as attorney general but there are things I Can't do until\nTill I'm governor I mean one of the things that we want to we think is very important as education and prevention for young young kids in regard to drugs or you know I started my career as a county prosecuting attorney I can tell you that I don't know in five years or ten years if we'll have an opiate problem but\nA ... there's always some drug problems and so we want to prepare young people starting as early as kindergarten through twelfth something age appropriate every year every year something that's been proven to to actually work we will implement that\nAnd it will make a huge difference the the other thing that we're we really want to do a is double down on President Trump's opportunities zones a were have opportunities owns Ohio oh this will mirror the tax cuts uh and and the job act\nThat the president and Congress put through a we will make it so that ah somebody looks at the state of Ohio and I said well that's the place to invest that's where I I Want to take my ... capital gains I Want to take a ticket to Ohio were put through this in our\nYou know most problematic areas and you know we we believe that a given that tax break I was going to get a lot of money invested in Ohio we hope from a you know all over the country\nAnd I really hope ... ... if you take\nThat up the young son Warren given the physical structure that exist there already in your combined with economic opportunities on it will cook I I talk with moaning valley chamber when they came to DC on their flying but first you gotta win tonight I'm flying into Columbus Ninety eight Ninety answer dot com and people want to come out and see a Mike Gallagher and Jim Jordan in ... my taxes nice sitting down at\nUm a over American college\nUh that'll be great and then we're gonna we're gonna juice turnout but early voting gets going in the Buckeye State doesn't it I mean we're we're ...\nWe're into it we should we ... we started this week and uh you know we're ...\nWe've seen a since the cabin up a nomination and what the Democrats did and what happened in the Judiciary Committee we we've seen a real\nA firing up of our conservative base in Ohio or in a county is all over the state and you and you mentioned you mentioned an area of\nThe state of Ohio in ... in eastern Ohio them hunting valley for example stupid little\nAh which you are very very familiar with you know historically historically big big a Democrat area bought\nSocially conservative and what we saw of course is what what President Trump did when he ran and did exceedingly well uh in areas that have never in in several lifetimes have not been a gone gone Republican\nHumble county went for Trump patio happened since I think Nixon\nSo I'm sure that's right it's been it's been a long time but but you're right\nUh we lay lay our opportunity zones on top of that I mean we ... we have them with with the tax bill but we're on doubled down and I'll say we're on to do that with our our tax code in the state of Ohio too and and we really believe that it's going to have a lot of investment [noise]\nAh we ... we can't have there's there's not enough government money out there to have a government investment and to have\nA we have to get the private sector and ... and we have some great things going for us and a lot of areas but with this with this tax cut that we're talking about that opportunity a it's a really super economic development Ohio\nLast question attorney general Mike DeWine next governor Ohio and I was there for Rob Portman before I joined NBC and had to stop doing fundraisers there like a thousand people running for governor but they all came together behind you and you're not used it as your as your a number two guy in Germany she's running

helping the People's Republic of China develop tools of information filtering and basically control when this as a nation that has admitted that a million like ours in concentration camps\nYeah I think vice president Pence spoke very eloquently on that point or at his speech at the Hudson Institute last week and I think the biggest applause line he got was when he said that the information technology sector don't cooperate with the Chinese in in this effort\nI Would say the shareholders of these companies that portray themselves as the open Internet transparent future really you want to make money off of repression I if I were shareholder I'd I'd want to know what the answer of our corporate leadership was\nThe shareholders though we certainly would not have allowed him pre war Germany Americans to sell the crop iron works the designed for new artillery are we is there a role for the government to step in the Silicon Valley and control technology transfer\nWell we were looking at the export the control area it look we did this and continue to do it in terms of dual use technology that could affect nuclear\nChemical or biological weapons are ballistic missile development I think in cyberspace we're entitled to do the same thing that because we've abandoned free market principles but because we have to be realistic about the adversaries\nWe face in the world today that use the fruits of American freedom against us and we shouldn't let that happen we want to do it in ways to protect our open economy but the NIH others the ability to take advantage of it\nOr return to the previous administration in Bob Woodward's book a lot was overlook one thing that was overlooked with a candidate missions that they had hit the scope of the north Korean nuclear problem\nFrom the country so that they had to wear a further along I had to warn President Trump but that was his biggest problem didn't they in fact conceal the extent of the problem and we're we're prepared for preemptive strike the Woodward describes\nWell that the Obama policy they described as strategic patience a mad is a synonym for doing nothing about North Korea and it's another example of a ... bill coming due for President Trump\nOr I think the combination of the potential use of military force against North Korea and the maximum pressure campaign that the president waged on the economic front is what has brought that Kim Jong under the table Mike Pompeo has just returned from another trip there will see a meeting I think between\nA chairman Kammen President Trump sometime in the next couple of months\nUh we'll see other efforts go forward the president has held the door open for North Korea he gave them a great little uh a movie in a in Singapore when he met with Kim Jong on that showed what North Korea's future could be so the doors open\nThey need to denuclearize completely and reverse simply and if they do that and walk through the door of the future could be very different for the north Korean people\nNow John Holdren has been known for Twenty years as a little skeptical of skeptics a feel good diplomacy are you feeling good about the diplomacy with North Korea\nLook I don't think we'd be in the place we are today if we'd continued to pursue a Iraq Obama's policies I think four more years of that under Hillary Clinton would have guaranteed to North Korea with deliverable nuclear weapons\nOr the the future remains uncertain on the president's diplomacy he's optimistic he pressed his heart he does not have stars in his eyes about this now they're just my palm pale neither does Jim Mattis neither do I\nShould we be encouraging our allies to match what the Chinese are doing the creation of artificial age holes in the parliament of in the Philippines could do it Japan can do it I said to be doing\nWell I think we've got to do more first to establish for the Chinese that we do not acknowledge the legitimacy of any of this the ship the near a collision you mentioned a is an example of how dangerous Chinese behavior is\nWe have now gotten more participation by allies the British the Australians and others are sailing whether it's through the south China Sea we're going to do a lot more on that uh I think we could see more exploitation of mineral resources in the south China Sea with or without Chinese cooperation\nThey need to know they have not achieved the fed accompli here this is not a Chinese province and will not they\nAre in getting the right to say I ask you too thanks Russia's in the rearview mirror\nAnd Christopher Wray said this yesterday they're worried about today's problem China is worried about tomorrow's problem how much of our strategic thinking stuck in a rush of first as a problem and not focused on China as the major geopolitical strategic challenge of eccentric\nWell I think we do see China as the the major issue of the century I don't think we're stuck in the rearview mirror but what I Would say is in a world that's now post post Cold War\nWe are in a very complex environment the United states faces a range of challenges globally summit the strategic nuclear level ... at the

but yeah\nYeah that was there was a lot of that going on by the way and they forget the Labor Day storm of the Nineteen thirties destroyed a lot of Rhode Island they forget Camille in the sixties I mean if it's convenient the Gulf goes up and down and different years it's up this year and that made it tougher\nMhm yeah it did and uh and it if you live on the coast you know and what we see in this Michael thing is living right on the coast is dangerous if you live in the Gulf from the Atlantic seaboard\nBut uh if you know if she lived five miles and that's not like you're enjoying wonderful coastal living and so those people are getting punished and [laughter] that's too bad\nYou know I talk this morning with a northern Virginia beach family or because they have two hundred thousand people without without power down there and so it started in Florida went through Georgia South Carolina North Carolina an exit in Virginia [noise]\nThat's just never happened before that is a weird thing and we're going to see the president respond to it but now\nKind of told everyone a chamber of a con usa dot org if they want to help out let's turn to the other tragedy which was the violence done to the presumption of innocence and I think this is a\nAnswer the mob rule that with legitimize uh enter the difference between political rallies and chanting lock her up which I don't particularly approve of it but it's a rally and it's a chance [noise] versus menacing Ted Cruz and his wife in a restaurant with the imminent threat of violence or the after the mobs in Portland\nI think we've lost our capacity to distinguish Larry between political speech and political violence\nTo two weeks ago a in a ... I read something by the grandson and I heard a talk at Hillsdale by Charles Kessler and they both use the expression cold civil war and uh you know this is like the early Nineteen fifties right\nAt the gym in Eighteen Eighteen\nFifty shades aching shifts and what's the future of it the point is we have to have an agreement that we're going to decide our political differences through a process and the process has to be agrees in advance and especially if the process is hallowed\nThen you don't want to mess with it right if you read Lincoln's great first inaugural address he says that the first time that\nA valid ever replaced bullets in a fundamental too so it was just it was an Eighteen hundred in the United states of America which I think is true so so the point is you're going to so the the people elect under the constitutional process sees a majority in the Senate\nAnd the president of the same party and he gets to elect a bunch of people on the Supreme Court that can't be planned in advance that's you know that's how the constitution works and so\nTo obstruct the process because you know what what I think is\nIt was a shame for this thing even to be taken up and the reason is that that lady seems like a fine lady and says sincere but there was no evidence for this and it happened you know a human generation ago when Brett Kavanaugh was it was a kid so the thing is\nThat something that you just would not be able to get to the bottom of\nIt is it is a problem of proof that the very beginning that ought to have been recognized that interminable but it was politicized was weaponized\nI Want to pause for a moment of cold civil war 'cause veteran I have a disagreement about this from Charles and I\nI went up the ante them two weekends ago\nAnd that's a hot civil war that's twenty three thousand people dead in one day from a dunk or church all the way down to burn side bridge and even in the Eighteenth fifties we had\nNo John Brown and the Bush ... in Kansas and stuff like that or we're not there but I Do think the warning about what happens\nWhen we don't realize that debate can be fierce but you cannot men is that is the constitutional test by the way and in the in the Supreme Court\nWhich is the intention and the ability to incite violence is illegal if not protected speech\nThat's right that's right and you know the\nSo I I think I said this on a couple of weeks ago but in in the Nineteen forty five Winston Churchill last elections socialist whom he said what ultimately result in a ... and the socialist got forty eight percent of the vote and they got over sixty percent of the seats\nAnd so of course the conservatives were rumblings about that and Churchill gives them a species the leader of the opposition now and he says\nWe're not gonna complain about that this is the constitutional system this is how they got in and this is how we're going to replace them and so you know it it contrast that\nWith the ... of the electoral college and now the Senate in the country in other words there isn't any constitutional arrangement that shouldn't be it's not subject to a salt in the interest of partisan politics of the day\nIt is that is true everything is under assault and if you're not on the right team the media will\nAbsolutely demonize you and by the media I mean the broadcast networks with the exception of Fox I mean\nThe big newspapers I mean the beltway Manhattan Media late they are of the left and they will demonize you if you are not on the left and they will protect you if you are and Kanye West is finding out big time on CNN where they are mocking him in terms that\nWere any other commentator to use concerning any other minority ... that come to her would be off the air\nThere well we did have the Donald Trump rule now and that is anything can be said about him or anybody connected to him [laughter] that's [laughter] that's a new future of American politics\nSanta repeat that that is true that you can't go low there is nothing so low about Trump that will get you've thrown off the air\nYeah me neither I violence may be a threat of violence that would do it\nWell that's a crime as you said and then not protected speech and violence against the president is particularly crime or so they don't they don't do that but I mean this is a movement to impeach Brett Kavanaugh\nGoing on right now and in you know the uh the chief justice has referred to as\nA complaint that he did not manifest judicial conduct in answering the charges against him before the Senate that's been transferred the tenth circuit but the point is everything is going to be harassed at every step and that's the tone of politics these days\nIs not fair or a good political maneuver and if she transferred that to what it would take to convict the guy of something which is rightly a different standard than just making that argument about politics then this is crazy 'cause it would never go anywhere\nAnd when we come back we're going to play for your um you the seminal exchange and the media John Dickerson and Mitch McConnell talking about judges and what people have to understand about the constitution\nAnd the structure of the constitution and why walking that he was right because the Republicans had the majority and that's\nHow we run faith in the country according to the constitution stay tuned

of saying\nNo no no he wasn't no he was not Great Britain is perhaps the least racist country in the world\nYeah so he says the point is I have little doubt that he's brave and all kinds of combat and
