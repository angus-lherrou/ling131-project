little Chris how are you\nOK over the weekend a lot of he said she said stuff going on between the United states in the Soviet era Soviet and Saudi Arabia where Saudi Arabia warned on Sunday it will respond to any threats against the stock market\nBob stock markets plunging following president Donald Trump's warning of severe punishment over the disappearance of the Washington Post contributor your mall shaggy\n[noise] yeah we're going to the other one uh\nPlays out a Saudi Arabia is that this this is part of the problem with the the Middle East is you've got to get a hold of various different directions\nUm it's going to be difficult to get everybody on board I think that they'll probably be if if I was a betting man\nI think that probably a lot of superficial type a punishment for Saturday for example you're seeing a lot of a major business leaders pulling out of this a major conference that's taking place there and watch that but the reality is I don't think a much of the world wants to deal with higher fuel prices and\nAgain you know we we've got our own independence there even though it's a global energy market uh other areas of the world uh Europe in particular would definitely be hit by to see it when you're talking about China's well or that they got a lot of their oil from the middle east also\nWell two things come to mind\n[noise] number one\nSaudi Arabia has got a big military deal which was actually agreed to last year and they're starting to get delivery on what was agreed to last year right now so we could conceivably stop the delivery of some of those military weapons that they are actually getting correct\nGood but then you know Donald Trump makes the point okay then they'll just go buy them from China or by the Russia\nUm it's not like this stuff is just not already up for sale I'm a I don't know you know again we've still got to get a bottom of what happened it doesn't look good\nAt this point in time or by any stretch the imagination and I kind of curious to um you know how your ... turkey knew what was going on ahead of time a lot of parts that are going on with this thing\nUm but then you got to understand like Saudi Arabia is okay ah they've got this this new friends that trying to move them or at least on\nThe surface trying to move them in one direction but make no bones about it there are despotic regime\nUm you know that I was I was talking about this on my program or the other day I says we're walking I was in New York City not long ago walking up Seventy ninth street towards Fifth Avenue and I you know show the kids the Iraqi embassy I said you know how many people here are the Iraqis pulled off the streets and dragged into that embassy dissidents\nOr the the anti Saddam Hussein or types back in the day on that still happens now and then make that happen that these various different embassies around the globe you know\nAnd of course the other thing that comes to mind as you did mention turkey turkey is claiming that they have audio and video of what happened to the individual and then of Saudi Arabia saying well then produce it\nYeah I I agree I think that they need to produce it I think that you know but that ... they're they're saying if I'm not mistaken that they don't want to reveal how they go about obtaining there and they're afraid that you know on several spy there\nObviously there ever see bugging inspiring their their neighbors in the embassy there's what's going on\nFor for everybody does it shatters the spy I mean nobody you know but it could make up well that's what goes on that you know you walk by that receive you know that's what those things are for [laughter] I mean that's that's the main function for those things but uh again that you need to get more information out in regards to this ed hopefully you'll producer\nNow you're familiar with who ah John Zogby is right\nThe poster\nYeah good old Syracuse University pollster member of University College of you to college or University of Minnesota okay oh yeah that's where he started but anyway he\nUm is claiming that his polls are telling that the Democrats have nearly impossible mission of gaining any seats at all\nIn the Senate in fact he's stating that he believes the Republicans will gain seats in the Senate however in the house she saying it's about a fifty fifty chance that the Dems could win control there in the house rather\nThan a lot of things if they're going to have the ... in the house I Tony ... outlines no\nI don't know how that you know what I mean it could happen I don't know how it's going to play out in these various\nDifferent areas there um you know Donald Trump is most certainly on the stump on ... and I think you know even though we're just took a couple weeks out I think that there's got to be\nI I Will probably see a bombshell or art to thrown from now until that are in one way shape or form or to try to stir things up um again Donald Trump put out his list of accomplishment um last week\nAnd you're not actually or something like that and\nI forget exactly long print the\nPage [laughter] is a good twenty five thirty pages worth the paper that's for sure and he has accomplished a lot and uh again people taking a look at what's going on in the economy and take a look at jobs were going to see how people are going to end up voting\nMhm [noise] now one other thing here before I have to let you go um professional actors and actresses are musicians sometimes like to open your mouth and say most of this person because right\nOf course\nTaylor Swift about a week or ten days ago came out and trashed Marsha Blackburn running for the U.S I'm a I'm Sorry yeah the U.S Senate seat there are in Tennessee and um she was behind her opponent there\nAnd she begged Tennessee in to vote for the opponent and a came out with a you know or even said something I needed something and the American music association awards but\nOnce she opened her mouth right after that and of course when Kavanaugh saying that went on the way people saw um Marsha Blackburn is now up by eight points in the Senate race thank you very much Taylor Swift\nYeah these celebrities just now starting to get the message that you know no one listens to them anymore they don't care or they don't care at least you know anybody that a lot of voters just really just don't um you've got to be following some celebrity what they have to say I'm against it makes sense and I think that your people kind of long for them is for\nThe kind of be quiet and to do their jobs so I think we all would rather see that it's okay you can have whatever political tend to want to share but you\nKnow openly going out and and you just don't make sense you know business wise really that's\nAbsolutely right well your show is coming up in ten minutes I'm going to let you go and thank you very much for another interesting conversation\nMadame ...\nYep Kris Maher cascade watchdog on Wall street the watchdog and Wall Street catch him over their eyes you do Monday through friday on our sister station Thirteen eighty to ... and he's on there and his network a station says well now I

but they they cut it out I told you it was going to happen in first band flocked expected to do twenty million and that was a low ball number sixteen million and it's got a flock\nNo one's going to go I I told you this I thought it was so obvious unplanned so why do I begin with that\nBecause the reaction to the Donald Trump interview on CBS was also ... people who like Trump love being interviewed people hate Trump hated the interview and Trump in it\nEver say some things are predictable and obvious they'll let me do the predictable obvious stuff about the elections that are coming up I was on Al Sharpton show yesterday and got asked and I and I listen to um meet the press yesterday wasn't on the panel by watching it\nStacey Abrams is running for governor George it started to complain about voter suppression I said okay she's lost that's over that's done or if you're complaining about voter suppression you're conceding that you're going to lose the election\nCannot run on jobs or

I had no matter\nWho could add the Republicans win four or five net plus seats\nAnd be at fifty six Republicans because they are the country is rejecting\nVomiting out actually\nThe the angry nuts the\nDespicable politics of personal destruction and the attacks on Trump it just makes so crazy now to turn on Morning Joe and see the hand wringing about sixty minutes of your which it was frankly very entertaining and interesting in a real glimpse of the president is that as he thinks\nOne story has got to be talked about today\nAfter twenty two those are the greatest fighter in the world ever created they're very expensive I Believe it was a hundred and fifty million dollars per plane we only have two hundred and something like that\nThe greatest to their stealthy they could be anything they can be super on it they can be any Russian jet in China which at the point to is our best jet and we should have made six hundred of them but we shut the wind down prematurely\nOf course or for whatever reason inexplicable to me Seventeen to twenty twos weren't left Kendall airfare space\nAnd their condition as I Know which says to me a likely badly damaged that is the equivalent of losing eight cruisers at a naval engage with the cost of that is staggering\nAnd the accountability of it is going to be severe\nI bring that up because last night the president was talking about general secretary of defense Mattis um\nHere's what he said ... number three\nThought about general matter ... what I don't know he hasn't told me that\nWith him it could be that he is I think it's sort of a Democrat if you want to know the truth but General Mattis has a good guy we get along very well may leave I mean at some point everybody everybody people leave that's Washington\nThat is right away completely true even during the early days of the war\nAnd by the early days of the war the war has been going on since two thousand and one is now two thousand they think that's a Seventeen year war now\nAfghanistan and Iraq and in Syria\nIslamist extremism around the world for Seventeen years early in the war six years in the war W doesn't get to leave\nAnd I always I always shook my head is like George Marshall walking off\nThey fired Don Rumsfeld he had to replace them after the two thousand and six election that's not that's not leaving but some aid voluntarily left in the middle of the war I thought what George Marshall left during World War two really got started in thirty nine and Marshall just stayed in state and stayed never complain that the professionals in the military never leave but\nEverybody does leave and now I'm thinking\nGeneral at it I mean secretary of defense Mattis and it's important to refer to ... because he was a civilian general\nPast it has to look at losing Seventeen twenty twos let's say who is that on\nWho is responsible for that that is a ... that is a strategic why is\nThat the idea of Seventeen after twenty two fighters they are not stop all\nThey are our front line of defense it it's just a natural that they left the air force base\nAnd service culture and accountability in the navy fired five senior admirals last year over three collisions and the grounding\nSenior animals that navies\nA culture of accountable at the airport says but I think secretary of defense Mattis has to be looking in the mirror this morning saying if I got all that money I got\nSeventeen\nAnd replaceable after twenty two\nLeft at times it turned out like I I just can't I Can't even describe what that means um so\n... uh this is a brutal story it's a horrible probable murder I have no idea who did it on whose orders\nI have no idea if it actually occurred at the Turkish embassy the Turks say that the Saturday consulate in Turkey and the Turks that did suggest thing that they can spy but air to one is a bad guy to understand that\nHere's what the president said cut number nine\nTen mile a shell game and journalists and journalists [noise]\nWas he murdered by the Saudis and the princes in the order to tell him when nobody knows yet but we'll probably be able to find out it's being investigated is being looked at very very strongly\nThat we would be very upset and angry if that were the case as of this moment they deny it and then that tonight vehemently [noise]\nCouldn't be them yes challenger ... got on the phone and\nThe prince he when he did he deny deny it they denied every way you can imagine in the not too distant future I think we'll know an answer what are your options let's say they did what are your options would you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators\nHave proposed she went depends on what the sanctions will give you an example they ordering military [noise]\nEverybody in the world one in that order Russia wanted at China wanted we wanted it when we got it so would you cut that\nWhat I don't want to do ... Latino racy and all these ...\nHurt jobs I don't\nTo lose in order to like that there are other ways of a\nShame to use a word that's a pretty harsh words on his show how everybody what to take care you know there's a lot to say there's a lot at stake and [noise]\nMade me especially so because this man was a reporter to something you'll be surprised me saying that if something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nYard so that is exactly the right thing to say we don't know we're going to get to the bottom of it is disgusting that it's a reporter a terrific and so the president is learning how to do these things he was interrupted like a thousand times by Leslie stall but we'll come back to that\nAh today we begin week three of my campaign urging you to support the alliance defending freedom this was the mobs versus jobs elections also the judges election it's a justice Kevin I'll watch it it's a premier religious freedom organization the United states as alliance defending freedom senior counsel Jim Campbell tells us\nAll these crazy left wing or is Alexandria ...
