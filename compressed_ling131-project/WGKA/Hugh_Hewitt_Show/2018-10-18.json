I don't the story that I talked about here on my show was several weeks ago talking about how products that um if you're a guy in that particular was a guy mix coffee mugs especially type a coffee mug and New Jersey in and out people in China were doing a knock off\nOthers coffee mug and it was cheaper for people to buy it from China\nThan it was to buy it for him because to ship it from China was actually cheaper for him Kippur for people that the ship it from here in the United states and this is due to weigh a hundred year plus old postal treaty that was done\nAnd Donald Trump is getting rid of that and he's got to make it fair we're not going to subsidize products from China coming here by the postal service and you know the funny thing was is it yeah Brock Obama's given the opportunity to do this and he didn't do it and I'm Glad that Trump is\nA danger to explain this is a ... if you were to buy you know identical products identical weight and then shipped\nBy the postal service\nIs cheaper to get it from Shanghai than it would be for you to get it from Newark New Jersey\nAnd that's nuts that's crazy yeah\nIt is it's it's worth subsidizing a foreign manufacturers and pour in a good Baker is that why is that fair how is that right\nIt's not and obviously it's something we need to do and again you know what we're talking about here\nUh I'll give you the phone number here to zero two two to four three one two one for the house of representatives to zero two two to four three one two one and for the Senate to zero two two to five three one two one two zero two two to five

don't know what's next\nWell you know now the relative of Pocahontas was telling Elizabeth Warren that she's not happy that her name as being an even thrown into the mixture relative\nWhy listen she made a fool out of herself with that higher thing and and yeah that that keeps going um you know just walk away let it go that have died um but yeah I mean to you if both sides of the aisle even the even the networks are crying out loud to have a difficult time defending our eye on what she's been up to\n[noise] so what are you talking about today\nWould ever going to talk about the postal service thing that's for sure I mean that's a big one I think that that's great um again it it level helps level the playing field for American manufacturers and or anything that could probably ...\nSo you're going to talk about the nickel plane and the way that we just talked about it\nAll the nickel plan you know I'm going to I've been talking about such a long time yesterday talk about

playing like Ninety five and a hundred percent humidity so I go inside immediately I turn on BBC World news expecting to see how are the bracket negotiations going you know Theresa May's over in Europe trying to save the deal and not have a hard breakfast blah blah blah and ah and of\nCourse we had a lot of pressure will be reporting and it is becoming increasingly clear that the number two in the secret services the fellow who ordered the interrogation the interrogation went wrong whether by designer and Ken there's some horrific details out there put out by the Turkish media but look this is the yellow dog media of Europe I'm not going to trust them on the details will eventually get the forensics\nBut looks like the number two guy in Saudi Arabian intelligence or Tibet\nAnd uh\nThe question will be did he do so with the knowing approval of the crown prince in the ... that's the only question will find that out\nBut that's what I thought I Would say on BBC Breakfast and showed me instead they had a reporter in\nNorth Dakota North Dakota they said there is you know eight people per square mile and North Korea went through the whole North Dakota thing for more cows than people in North Dakota it's hard to find people to talk to about politics I said what in the world of the BBC do it in North Dakota well Heidi hide camps\nOuting of sexual assault survivors and rape victims as well as missed naming people as rape victims\nHas shattered her campaign chair with by twenty points and BBC was set up there to explain to branch why Americans would be so upset over publishing a list of a hundred and twenty women many of whom were not sexual assault survivors or many of whom had not given their permission\nAnd it's like a tailspin and they spend a lot of time talking to Heidi Heitkamp supporters who are saying we're though so crushed we're sorry she did it she's terrible I'm terrible world terrible yeah you are who thought that up and Heidi Heitkamp and fired anyone you have to my knowledge but she'd done she toast\nWhat was interesting is they didn't ask\nWill have any impact on any other candidate of course it should\nEvery Democrat in every race is attempting to exploit\nMe too movement for democratic purposes that's what the cabinet areas was all about\nWas the attempt to use a me too movement Harvey Weinstein Bill Cosby moment to smear him an innocent of that Bill Cosby and the generally turn into an attack on all man people like me people like you've got nothing to do with this who conduct themselves a gentleman who grown up the right way\nWhoever wives of thirty six years or Thirty years or twenty five years or Fifteen Years or ten years or one day whom you honor and trust and you've got daughters\nAnd mothers and you do not act this way there's a there's a five percent of the population three percent I don't know creepy terrible horrible people Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby's among them and there are a lot of it by ah survivors of sexual abuse in rape out there I Know some I represented one\nAnd it's a terrific how in different institutions are\nWhen abuses occurred but that there's not a license Democrats\nTo turn everyone into a mob shouting me too at innocent people like Brett Kavanaugh or an id I'd camps position to publish a list of people who are not victims of rape or sexual abuse or who did suffer that terrible assault and did not want to be publicly out it\nJust got a bunch of list from a women's advocates groups around the state that in check with the people that's Heidi Heitkamp\nTry you know what I punished Joe Donnelly for that I punish Claire McCaskill for that type punish a Bill Nelson for that I'd punish Joe mansion for that Joe mansion voted for cabinet but he didn't do so until it was over\nSo we already had fifty one votes he knows come and so he just decided to do it I'd still vote for pat Morrisey in Virginia over Joe Manchin imagine going to vote for the next one [noise]\nOf course you're not going to vote for bait or working their vote for Ted Cruz of course you're going to vote for Josh Hawley over Claire McCaskill and the guy is creeping up John James in Michigan I think we're an AC fill in the game but it it's that that will require Ohio to surprise away Kentucky surprise when they elected\nA pet Bevan\nThe off year that was truly a stunner he was supposed to lose by five Seventy one by the same amount that's what\n... well the only to ten point error in the polls but John James up in single digits and rising I think he is the most interesting Senate candidate tied with Martha mix Sally in Arizona\nBecause they're fighters there are veterans of combat maybe offended you they defended me with their lives but at the mic Sally in the air and an eight ten providing ground support for troops in combat\nOr first attack pilot fighter attack pilot who is a woman in the air force history\nAnd a John James out of West point became an Apache pilot fought in Iraq and Afghanistan than men sadly is like took a bad turn he went to the University of Michigan business school\nBut then again a successful entrepreneur in Detroit and I do not understand why we have not got stories everywhere about the the black guy up in Michigan who who flies Apache attack helicopters went to West Point and it's given Debbie Stabenow a run for the money you know why\nYou know I we get paid or work every night on every show and nothing about John James because John James ...\nI can a Republican in bed O'Rourke is white and a Democrat\nAnd the mainstream be is full of blue Barbara bubbles that like white Democrats in red states and they blow a lot of money and time on them and they really are afraid of an African American like John James in Michigan they are really afraid of John James\n... if I if you would get the Koch brothers or somebody I Would just poor ad\nAfter out into the television marketed Detroit I'd go and try and get ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of the African American John said yeah he's a Detroit kid who went to West Point he made good he went to Michigan we like that unless we're you know Michigan State people like Alberta\nWinning John James can when you get behind that and I I get the sense that hedging I saw on BBC\nWatson MSNBC you know my my viewing is you'd watch Jake Tapper at Fort Chuck Todd at five and Brett berets six three best news programs there actually newsy Bab all points of views\nJake Tapper for Chuck Todd at five but parents six if you got time you're throwing the b._b._c. world news if he can do you want to find out what's going on ...\nMy sense is everyone knows it's jump ball for the house and it's moving to the Republicans\nAnd they're all off chasing cause show geek because they should be changed in ... one of us one of my colleagues at the Washington Post and is pretty bad story but it's profoundly not of interest to the average American voter who was

Claire McCaskill campaign like\nHeidi Heitkamp campaign has collapsed what do you think\nOh I wouldn't include that you I mean we've got two weeks left than we have to work very hard I liked the position that Josh Holly is in I think he's getting the right means and I think he has the momentum but we got to work all the way to be a\nWell of course I don't know I watch the b._b._c. world news last night and when the b._b._c. world news goes to North Dakota and declared the Heidi Heitkamp a campaign over that's kind of a early warning signal of collapsed I don't want anyone to stop doing anything 'cause their congressional races as well\nBut I Do look at the poor video there are people that are rallies there's just no energy and she voted against Kavanaugh\nYeah I think they have a vote has hurt her a lot in the state I think Josh has met a message is getting through in what you he's\nHe's new he's fresh she has integrity and I think people trust him so in addition you he always had a name identification gap and there was always going to be true as that gap shrunk that he was going to get stronger and I think we're seeing that now\nWhen Claire McCaskill said Jim talented she was writing off a heel what was she talking about\nThe Boot Hill of Missouri a which is by the way some of the best the farmland in the country 'cause it's built the country and uh what she's saying is she doesn't think she's going to run very well there are mental they say oh he's going to run really well there\nAre she's going to try and win by Karen in in St Louis and Kansas City very heavily that's typically the formula\nI don't think it's going to work here I think Josh is going to run well all over the state but you know we're not talking about uh ten point you know election probably blow you off but it is it says ... year as city I've ever see I mean I I just it's it's hard to make for production is even two weeks out\nI Hope you go over and play our mid term madness gym because I think it is I'm getting more and more comfortable with the Senate races knowing which way they'll break and I'm very encouraged by Jim John James\nSoaring in Michigan oh you can close that gap but I'm pretty pretty comfortable about it now I'm On a new\nJersey I'm watching the New Jersey to\nOil yeah Menendez this fall and because I mean that's really a heavy burden to be carrying and this year to have been prosecuted as she was and they are not money\nInto that too you know\nTo get their ... their panic special counsel Mueller is expected to issue findings on the core aspects of his Russia probe soon after the November midterms now I Am a I have a problem with this story being out there I have a problem with a leak either one exonerated the president or one uh blasting the president\nOr this is not what justice should be doing it would be disastrous for justice if this report comes out before the election agree or disagree Jim Talent\nNow I agree uh it it would be disastrous to leak something of this if if you live in a lecture or not I mean you I mean they all they need to hold them confidence until they could present a full report everybody could read it I don't think it's going to find anything I've never believed there was collusion with the Russians\nYou know they got in a port and some others with some unrelated things but I never thought there was ... and I'm going to be shocked if they find it\nBut I ... and I expect the president be exonerated but I still think it would be bad for the bureau and the department if a lake that before the election it will ... will be just like coal me coming to the to the microphone about Hillary during twenty sixteen they got to get these high profile investigations off the cycle of politics yeah\nHe would be bad you'd think they'd be they'd been compromised in the last couple of years I mean it's it was terrible now I think\nSessions' is is moving I'm not with regard to this because he's recused himself but I think uh\nHe is the director are trying to clean up the top levels of the euro and the department to try and get ... out of there it's essential you're right this is a huge structural question and I don't mean by that downgraded I mean it's very or to the people I have confidence\nIn the integrity of the department and the bureau\nOf operating on politically so you're right this would be this would be another huge problem along those lines\nI Do not expect um attorney general sessions last much after the election\nBut I'm hoping Michael ... replaces him uh we'll see if you have a comment on that but I Need your quick comment on my ... going to turkey and Saudi Arabia a big Clinton's comments he said I don't want to talk about the facts trying to make them look bad what he says I Want to talk about the fact they want to talk about back because we don't know what the facts are yet that's what he said and that's exactly what he should have said Jim Talent\nYes and we don't know what the facts are you know you've been reading and I've been reading that Danny but it had a good article today on the on the Web site actually from yesterday\nThat we don't know I mean yes there was there was clearly Saudi involvement in this we don't know what factions in the Saudi Government were responsible or and\nWe we need to continue to be able to work with Saudi Arabia in the region and that's the things that that the president and I'm a or a balancing and they certainly don't want to try and strike that balance till they know what so\nAmerica what was your high Canada I'm In Tampa today I

I'm gay art or the momentum that we got the ah oh Kavanaugh episode has been measure of all that I Know in that I didn't know was there a reason all that just came out that you are\nThe Annapolis the star around the real clear politics that shows you and Joe and the margin of error and it shows the libertarian was seven percent that always makes me crazy\nWhen their side these elections what are your city or libertarian friends out there about how important it is if they really care about freedom they got to vote for the guy who's going to support the originalist judges not not Donnelly but broaden\nExactly and so much of a what libertarians believe in and Republicans that line up and I think they just need to realize that uh if you really want your vote count bring it over to my side I live my life was alive\nRead an enterprise that that I think as they you know start scratching their heads here they are under three weeks now they'll be coming by\nPratchett at that real clear politics to average is all I think to get that result that I can tell yours out there are the ones we really pay attention to our own and we do um you know weekly through the finish line at a much better news than that of the Kavanaugh a\nEpisode when Donald declared that he was going to vote\nAgainst the judge or\nEarly on in that in and reaffirmed it uh we feel really good with a\nStructural lead that we're going to be taking into these final three weeks that I it was unbelievable what a difference that made because I think folks really were white or in this particular race at a few others what is the differentiating factor and that was it you weaken palette from the moment almost\nBecame public on it at a grassroots\nJust across the board or disappointed with it\nWell it was it was a disaster for Donnelly because Indiana supported cabinet and they believed them and I know they are seeing the average still has a man but I don't think they've got the cabinet bump in here and I think that bump across the country has been seven eight sometimes ten points Mike Braun because people woke up\nAnd said my gosh the future of the court for the future of our liberties back to our libertarian friends our First Amendment freedoms of speech and religion are are are right to be free of our property being taken without a\nCompensation our Second Amendment right they're all on the ballot because judges are on the ballot\nWhile and on on those particular issues ah\nI've I've got endorsement of the n._r._a. all the pro life groups or the last debate he only agreed to two of them are one was about a week and a half ago\nClearly pointed all that out if we go mostly by what our own information houses because we do it right at in Indiana you gotta you start methodology to get accuracy\nAt all I can use we feel we're in great shape or were carrying a structural lead ... that\nWe\nLost you there for a second Mike or you might be out there might be on your back I understand George W. Bush came into campaign for you the president's for you you've got to the entire Republican ticket but again I go back to leave libertarians because they really we can't afford them to indulge the idea that uh their vote doesn't matter their vote matters a lot in Indiana\nIt it really does that I think when it comes down that rats that will be making that calculation just like you described it that I think we'll get possibly after three or four of those points it goes with people look at the ...\nRecord and what I've done there you're going to see a libertarian straight on that believes that uh the last ... we have the better off we are so uh I think that will become clear\nThat might get a little bit more difficult time with Mike Braun candidate for Senate in Indiana and on my new

covering for existing conditions and kept on average\nUnless you out of five\nOr ten years everything Obamacare was intended to do but it's falling apart because that was big health care and big government doomed to fail I've done something then the real world actually address that problem\nAnd I want to close by again going back to the fact that Joe Donnelly your opponent voted against Brett Kavanaugh\nThis is a searing moment in American politics because it was so unfair Michael Avon audiences attacks are calling Brett Kavanaugh gang rape is it was so unfair and Joe Donnelly so for that
