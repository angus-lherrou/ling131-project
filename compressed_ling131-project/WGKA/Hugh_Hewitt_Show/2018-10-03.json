Murkowski the watchdog and Wall Street is ...\nMorning now\nA couple of interesting things have happened since you and I talked last pertaining to this Kavanaugh saying I'll just get them up there first of all there's been a whole bunch of the whole point in the story of Christine blast\nBoard and um the the term Dr also comes along with a little bit of question to it because of somebody want to check to find out if she was a you know 'cause she's a psychologist defined out and she's an instructor\nAnd she has a doctorate now they wanted to find out if she was practicing because there was a reference in one story that came out that she was a practicing psychologist and according to the city California She's not she's not recognized as a doctor to practice anything\n[noise] yeah well yeah there's a there's a lot of\nUh holes that are being popped up also her ex boyfriend as well um has come out and mentioned several things I'm this is why you've seen the\nNarrative change uh from sexual abuse and temperament and\nAlcohol and uh that that's you know basically what they're pressing a at this point guy and I'm yeah I'm curious to see uh what the Republicans do if they're going to go forward and they're going to have the votes this week which coddle set that is\nA ... there's you know you get countless stories now going through the credibility of her and the fact that she really doesn't have much it's also a interesting I was reading the paper that she actually actually she wrote talking about uh you know implanted memories yeah people which is a bit odd\nYeah she's very strange and then\nOf course we found out from from Rhode Island that this a concoction\nOf a story up there where Kavanaugh was allegedly and a drunken stupor after an altercation a bar in Nineteen eighty five\nAnd this guy came out and ah he testified just name was Chad loving tend a Yale University a college student now works as a history professor at North Carolina State University he released a statement accusing Kavanaugh being dishonest about his past\nWhat alcohol does that and the other well now we got the police report in this and guess what Kavanaugh wasn't even involved in what he was accused of he was there he was one of four people that were questioned by police but\nNot arrested nor charged they had nothing to do with anything what it was was a friend that cabin on new of course deadly sure one glass an imam with ice in it and a drink hitting the man in a year causing a touch of the demands right here and\nThat was it and capital I had nothing to do with it not seem to do with it\nYeah yeah so this story yesterday um again they're going to throw as much up there as they possibly can um I don't know I I just er yeah I report as being um [noise] a given to the Senate ... day right um I don't know why\nSome of it is not all of it some of it because some of the stories of not changed\nOr not they're not going to show this to the the general public I I don't know why um that would want to put put a you know the ... to this I don't know if if that's maybe a year what their strike or Democrats English I might not want to embarrass yourself it doesn't really miss\n'em so I don't know what's next it's actually interesting where Feinstein was being interviewed yesterday\nAnd she was talking about I'm Brett Kavanaugh's opinions\nOn various different issues rather than you know the reason why they stop I mean is that right you should have gone over\nThere on the judiciary hearings you write so again it's it's all the late tactics but hey listen I got to be honest Matt Republicans are allowing it\nThey might show they hold a vote if they want they can confirm it confirmed them if they want to do it now I guess Jeff Flake is is saying that he's not going to vote for him so you know he doesn't get confirmed again why\nIs that when I well we don't we don't know that for sure because it depends on how many Democrats come aboard and it looks like there's going to be two maybe three Democrats that are going to jump on the bandwagon 'cause if they want to get reelected in their home states one of them show mentioned uh they need to do it\nI I did is Heidi Heitkamp as well as is thrown into that mix will thing and um you know type of horse trading goes on but yeah I I'm not sure you want to confirm firmer\nGet done with a I mean I'm I'm tired of it you know you guys are around the Bush came on the table you gave him a I'm Sorry Democrats if they were ... situation there would not be caving no gun\nNow here's a little surprise and and then it because we do want to talk a little bit about the economy I'm Chuck Schumer\nThe majority minority leader Chuck Schumer want to be minority majority leader I should say uh he says is someone who voted against NAFTA and oppose it for many years I knew it needed fixing the president deserves praised for taking large steps to improve it well that's a\nKind of a positive but not really he kind of was reelected in saying that he took a large steps to improve it not that he fixed it\nWell it's it's a change it's not the same that we work for the entire deal there over the course things and they're still um you know for various different uh your producers of American products everything from\nA wind or the automobiles to the dairy industry on through so I'm again you're not going to get everything you want and it was just a political compromise but you have to come back to the table from time to time and say okay listen this work\nI Want to get to do business with one another out let's let's do this what we watch this fail it's come to some sort of global I'm Glad that we did but\nNow let's take a look at something here that everybody likes to talk about and that is their wages national wage growth is if\nThe highest it's been nearly seven teen months according to a new study released by glass door now we expect wages to continue to ... rises demand remains for workers throughout a number of industry so says glass door economists Daniels email in addition he reports of wages grew to point six percent\nOver the year from two thousand Seventeen however some industries like health care\nSolve their annual pay grow by as much as seven\nPercent\nThat's pretty impressive you know they it is that the median\nHousehold income is is a sixty thousand dollars a year which is pretty extraordinary\nTo see two thousand six sixty four year ...\nI'm a well looking at a situation right now where\nUm the whole ... the idea that they continue to push talked about the haves and have nots\nAn income inequality and all of this stuff that they like to continue to push it it's not\nResonating as well and then you're going to always have super rich people out there so what ... you know that there was going to be a discrepancy between the top in the bottom but when you have the median income continue to rise and people continue to do better and better um who cares\nAll righty well I'm going to let you go because in ten minutes you're going to be on the air and you're you're a a flagship station and my sister station All right ...\nThank you Chris Murkowski watchdog on Wall street catch them over there in ten minutes on Thirteen eighty to ... is our sister station here in the sale media group here in Tampa, Florida and also up there and his network stations in the morning\nAre playing it left and right because they want to be they want to be recognized as Larry ... into the news the ... the brand new Chuck Todd or Michael Barone\nPlanets symbol the twenty by closes races in the United states and I have a contest going to hear what the ... mid term madness you're registered ... then you have to pick the winner and the twenty five races\nBut you have to pick their margin of victory\nFor a lot of the early birds got in last week and they said oh well we know we know what's gonna happen not realizing that thirty days as a lifetime in politics so the bottom falls out on Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and Joe Manchin because they have participated in McCarthyism named the judge Kavanaugh\nAnd now they have to go back they might've picked Kevin Cramer North Dakota I sure would have but they might add a margin of victory of two to four points that I gotta go they're not going to get points for that if he wins by more than four points\nSo they got to go back and they either adjuster and trail but we allow that you make your injury and Hugo answer I think you've got to go in and make a second entry but head over to\n... play I think judge galvanize going to make him for it but I Am I Am now persuaded that when the president opened up last night although the hot ... from the media whoa how very do this for days ago he said Christine Blasey Ford was a credible witness yeah but four days ago\nA lot of stop had not happened before I talk about\nWhat has happened to her testimony\nLet's first talk about what the president had to say last night and this is what do you have to say last night\n[noise] have we got ready\n[noise] right [noise] well do you think it was it was one of them are good [noise]\nHow did you get home I don't

where was I don't know if that's the only thing are in [noise]\n\nIn a man's life is in tatters a man who lives just shattered\nWithout all over the media this morning\nIs the word mock\nAlright that's it that the president mocked Christian glossy forward I don't believe that is a fair characterization but it's a blue bubble characterization cause a cast the president a negative light what are you doing as he is casting doubt on her testimony is not mocking or as a sexual assault back to me is casting doubt on her testimony\nWas play it again cut number eight\n... [noise] right I Want to be well you think it was it was what I'll do it\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know [noise]\nWhat\nWas it I don't know how to [noise] upstairs downstairs where was I don't know if that's the only thing are in [noise]\n\nSlices Saturday a man slices shattered\nNow I don't believe his wife is shattered er and tattered I think you're going to be confirmed adjusted to the Supreme Court because this is McCarthyism\nBut I Will tell you why the president did that he knew that people were talking ... off the record in the green room with their hands over their microphones about the fact that the fear of flying defense that have been offered up the Chuck Grassley for the delay but that was a lie\nMaybe not her alive but it was a lie\nThat um she said she wasn't aware that the Kennedy would come to her and we got like a part of the documents that can be offering to come to her not sure whether lawyers over back from her or she lied she is familiar with polygraphs according to an uncle corroborated letter\nRight now by the way on MORNING Joe the current says Trump mocks Dr ... Christine Blasey Ford cheap mock is what they want it isn't mocking it's casting doubt on her credibility so her boyfriend has filed a letter that raises first of all\nThey've been boyfriend girlfriend for a long time\nBefore she met her husband she never raised an issue of sexual assault for him and she was familiar with polygraphs\nThat isn't the boyfriend ex boyfriends wetter it's uncorroborated there is also a new report from real clear investigations that the second front door\nIn her home was not installed because of cost her phobia\nThere was no contrary evidence of that coin was installed as a second entrance perhaps for an office for therapy no I don't know the answer to any of this stuff but what happened last night when the president went after her one beer testimony\nIs to appeal to people to begin to look at the credibility of the primary witness it also\nGot the attention off of the McCarthy I attacks on Brett Kavanaugh and back on the fact that this was all set up\nSo people are down on the president it might have been more prudent step the vice president do this in a more prudent way as I just that perhaps\nBut it is it that's not what happened meanwhile Lindsey Graham went out on Fox News with Harry ... said this number fourteen\nWell the cabin I'll bump Israel that the biggest change in the twenty Eighteen mid term so political observation in North Dakota sixty to twenty eight he should be confirmed every race in these Trump or red state held by Democrat there's been a surge by Republicans why\nOr whether you're a ...

break the glass\nAnd it may not have been proven that would have been better had Mitch McConnell or someone else pointed out there was no fear of flying\nThe committee offered to come to her and she was not aware of that something about the lawyer or the boyfriends letter on polygraphs and I'm not hearing about the sexual assault the second door investigation the Rachel Mitchell Report someone else should have done it but he didn't see it getting done so he did it\nWell I got that and ... and then call into question cannot fitness to be a judge it calls into question ... fitness can be a witness\nWell put well put again Lindsey Graham on Fox News last night here at the political reality ... number Thirteen\nOther people have looked at it that was kind of have a colleague a this is the new normal as hell [noise] want to be a judge at this as a\nTeen on Saturday cut number Thirteen\nOr ... well the cat and I'll bump Israel that the the biggest change in the twenty Eighteen mid term for political observation in North Dakota sixty the twenty eighth he should be confirmed every race in these Trump or red state held by Democrat there's been a surge by Republicans why\nOr whether you're a Trump Republican libertarian vegetarian McCain Republican Romney Republicans Bush Republican you're mad as hell\nBecause we're all United that this is unfair what they're doing it this good man cannot\nSo the Republican year will be a Democrat and Republican you been able to do something my friends on the other side I could never do not this party\nMorning so please welcome back from the United States Senate representing Iowa the great state of Iowa senator Joni Ernst pillows senator urged\nEl good morning he'll how're you doing\nI'm great I I Want to give you a a GPS on where we are this morning show I spent the first hour talking only two women first time caller just talked to capping in Scranton and in Dallas Sarah in Tampa\nThan in Detroit was a teenage son Norma in Michigan or legs Andrew in Newport Beach California a lame in Louisville June in Oregon showing Columbus and in San Diego operate on colors all of them want Kelvin are confirmed nine out of ten of them support what the president said last night one wish the hat and set it\nAnd they all don't believe Dr ... testimony though they are all very sympathetic and indeed one as a daughter is a barber survivor of sexual assault that's just a slice of what I've been hearing what have you been hearing\nWell I Am hearing of course a mixture of the calls I get to the office a lot of them are are saying get\nKavanaugh confirmed and then there are others that um are you know adamantly opposed we see those folks on the TV all the time um but what I Do hear when I'm Out and about as people just can't understand um why we haven't moved on with a\nGetting him confirmed they understand that he has the right to um credentials to sit on the nation's highest court and they fully expect that we should get this done soon\nI'm a ... I Do not believe the president was mocking the idea of someone being assaulted last night he was poking holes in testimony and I want to review a few things with you about the testimony\nFirst of all there was a story in Politico that she had a fear of flying which is why that had to be the way it should never actually said better so but that was represented the committee she did say she was not aware that the committee would come to her so that could be on her lawyers\nHer former boyfriend has filed a letter saying she's familiar with polygraph said never discuss sexual assault there was a new real clear investigations report that the second front door contractor evidence shows that was not about claustrophobia but at second entrance for an office\nThere wasn't a single verifiable assertion or testimony and not one that could be disproven either and then there's the ritual Mitchell Report I simply do not believe that that testimony could knock Brett Kavanaugh of consideration\nNo I I don't believe so either and and Dr Ford I Do honestly believe that she has experienced trauma at some point or do I sure do I I I think most folks will agree with that however um even the witnesses that she called forward\nActually uh can't corroborate or simply tear down that the testimony that she gave about um uh some party that she had attended so unfortunately um for for her I don't\nFind that to be a credible message again I Do want to reiterate that I Do think she experienced trauma but I don't know and it wasn't proven that it was judge Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile we have the secondary assault on judge Kavanaugh who I Do not know by the way he's ten years younger than I Am so we did not move in the same circles but he he strikes me as a very good and decent man and his two daughters caught me ten and a fourteen year old\nWill be dealing with this for the rest of their life and that people have not stood up\nTo a to underscore that their father is not a gang rape is but none of this has been proven that Sheldon Whitehouse is allegation was libel and slander as an immediately reputed referred by the committee for prosecution are you and your colleagues doing enough to stand up and and stand by judge cabin on your view\nWell I think we are standing up for judge Kavanaugh of course she won't hear any of those stories covered by mainstream media um but we certainly respect him we respect his family they have been put through um the\nThe worst possible situation ever with\nTheir father being demeaned and an discredited and and it's very unfortunate and we'd have those discussions on why would anybody want to step up be nominated for such an important\nPosition why would anybody want to run for office if it simply takes an accusation and unproven accusation which can put a family literally through hell\nDuring a lawyer who would be the chairman of how judiciary if the Democrats take the house but it's a very scary thought here said he is going to open impeachment hearings based upon the judges perjury nothing he said I'm I've been doing this for thirty five years remotely approaches perjury is a lawyer not that they're not a single\nUnder a viable assertion that he made he characterizes drinking he did not denies drinking ... why would anyone take that seriously\nWell just look around here it's all about obstruction it's about resistance it is about what can we stop and put in the president's way what can we put in Congress has way to stop them from doing a better job for the United states of America\nI mean look at our economy and how strong we are doing right now and and know thanks to our counterparts across the aisle they have tried to slow us down stop us at every opportunity whether it's getting rid of unnecessary regulation whether it is as stopping the tax cuts and JOBS Act would ever it\nIs they try and delay delay resist um and that's exactly what they're doing in the house if they take the house we can expect that for the next two years\nSo I've been calling this frequently on law and the new McCarthyism because McCarthyism as the taking of a very serious charge that's been proven in other contexts in that case originally treasonous conduct against the Rosenberg perjury by his\nAnd assigning it to the Hollywood screenwriters that's McCarthyism this McCarthyism is taking people like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and they're horrible crimes and attributing them to a Brett Kavanaugh and I think people need to stand up and say this is hysterical and it's deeply unfair senator\nAnd as it is absolutely unfair and it is absolutely ridiculous if you look around the Senate you can point fingers here too and members that have edit admittedly\nI'm had bad behavior and they're in their past which probably surpasses any accusation that has been\nLeveled against Brett Kavanaugh so I think people should tread very lightly on the things that they are throwing at this respectable\nMan and his family they don't want it to come around\nFive fold against them in the future so um we just need to do a better job here in the United states at teaching our children what is appropriate behavior what is not appropriate behavior and then of course I'm\nJust doing better as society but for other members to kind of laugh about what they did in their college days and then a point the finger at Brett Kavanaugh and say you are not qualified to serve on our nation's highest court because you drank beer and high school or college you know shame on you\nThey had better start thinking twice about what they're doing\nYou know a Jeff Flake who I of campaign within four and I believe to be fair and decent man he actually had good faith and the Democrats who's been proven wrong of course they did not use those to wait for the FBI report their media we moved the goalposts\nOf you got any sense when the FBI is going to finish and therefore a motion for cloture filed do you have a timetable\nI Do think that we will say that this week I think the FBI as probably winding down as as we are speaking out with their witnesses and I know that to our leader is very intent\nOn getting this uh voted on this week so as soon as we can receive the report I Do think it is important to a\nReview the information and the report for this supplemental investigation um we need to know that for our constituents just be able to verify you know everything is okay if everything does check out and then we move forward and and have this thing wrapped up but I Would anticipate um as the leader has said that he wants to see it done\nThis week have you heard any ... I've heard that possibly the FBI report will be done today in culture filed tonight have you heard that\nUh I have heard some semblance of that\nBut um again I I Would hesitate to say that on on a national program I just think that uh we have to make sure that we are going through the report that we have had time to absorb it and make sure that we're able to push back to our our constituents that everything is going to go and then we move forward\nDo you expect at this point at this point obviously with a report to review that you will be voting for judge Kavanaugh\nI well I'm unless they're as something that surfaces and they are in the investigative report that you know the supplemental report that would corroborate talked forwards testimony unless that happens I plan to support judge Kavanaugh\nAnd last thing I Want to play ... Lindsey Graham on on a Sean Hannity was by cutting number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats I think they're toast all all of ... uh do you agree with that senator I mean the go ahead\nI Do I absolutely agree with Senator Graham and and a lens they has been a hero through this process he clearly sees what is going on he has been able to demonstrate that and and clear concise and language for every one which we all appreciate uh but I Do believe that those are Democrats\nThat are in red states those are up this year they're going to have a very very difficult time if they did not support judge Kavanaugh you know\nThen they're also there are also a Joni Ernst just said glass houses senators glass houses about your college drinking honest to goodness Richard\nBlumenthal telling people lions one small thing that got what about Vietnam is just amazing and it's not going to work say certain America\nPortions of the Hugh Hewitt show or brought you in part by the association of what your American citizenship a Mac [noise]\n\n\n[noise] you're in the middle on non stop action packed\n[noise] she was [noise]\nImagine this dad sheer panic working late banned it gets alert on his smartphone that his motion activated blink security camera detected some auditors home\nYou opens his point gap and she's a little bit of a man peering through his kitchen window he called nine one one in alerts his wife crisis averted look the point of having um security alert you before some creep breaks in not after\nWhich is why I trust wink wink video cameras are wire free they set up super fast they run on batteries but last year and blinks live feed option let you monitor your home from your smartphone visit blink protests\nDot com slash you know contracts no subscription here's the deal get three Blake cameras for way less than the other guys in an extra Fifteen Percent off visit blank check dot com slash you blink protect\nDot com slash you one more time\nBlink protect dot com slash you you'll think me this is a huge Jewish [noise]\n\nThis is Bob Weinberg would ask them to be seafood my family's been selling seafood in Atlanta since before Nineteen hundred\nHey this is David Weinberg and now that we're Elton John's creek we're inviting and all you to come on out and eat like you're at the beach\nBut we do in ... you're not going to get that at some overpriced chain or a fancy trendy restaurants were more like an old fashioned fish and a half\nThat's right dad were cooking up the best seafood you're gonna find\nWe're talking about crime legs clams lobster shrimp raw fish fresh ranch vanish rainbow trout group or hey don't forget about her famous hush puppies that's right we raise our own hush puppies you're one of them\nYeah they're so good you'll dream about 'em at night and wake up with your mouth watering for more info\nCome on at ...

should be confirmed what are you hearing in your district\nYou know I was at a a couple of parades this weekend and then just running around northeast council meeting with a bunch of people so it's a ... but I certainly had a lot of people both men and women come up to me saying they were just very disgusted with the way the political circus played out\nIn the Senate and I do think it's transparent that there are many Democrats who are just trying to delay this past election and we're like nothing more than ... delayed seeping still\nUntil perhaps the Democratic when the president gained twenty twenty and I think even if you're right in the middle right let's say you're not committed part of the one way or the other I think there is a general sense that okay elections have consequences and it is and the president\nRight in the authority to nominate someone a and that judge Kavanaugh none of the allegations against him I think corroborated in any way and I just would draw people's attention\nTo the ninth age memos that the outside prosecutor Rachel Mitchell censor the Senate on Sunday and while your average person I think not and if they're going to read that and I'm ... I'm reading your average politician right rarely read more than one page [noise]\nUm I Do think it expresses what I've found to be the common sense and in fact in my district this weekend which is to

majority and and obviously on our side of things are very different and republics to play defense and I think are still pretty likely lose the house so I I don't know that\nYou know what everybody is hair on fire about cabinet right now for understandable reasons um\nBut but I just don't know that that it's going to ultimately move the needle elect poorly the way that\nFolks are beginning to talk about it could but but I think that we should just pump the brakes because as we've seen in the era of Trump or these days tend to burn hot and burn really fast\nAlberta now a low listen to me carefully on this because I bought the audience to to confirmed for you you can talk to them later I spent the first hour today like I did all of Monday talking only two women who were first time caller and we're pretty good at identifying scam artists and all that kind of stuff we've been doing this and fighting two thousand\nCathy in Scranton, Pennsylvania and in Dallas Sarah in Tampa and Detroit's got a teenage son normal also in Michigan\nAlexandria Newport Beach Elaine in Louisville Jeannie in Oregon Shelly in Columbus and in San Diego I can only do ten calls an hour that's the max nine out of ten of them are very happy the president went after Dr Ford's testimony last night\nCan out of ten of them one of them said no just the shuttle up that the other people cannot attend to them demanding cabinet or be confirmed and then senator urged came on\nAnd said based on the fear of flying issue not the committee didn't she didn't know the committee was coming to her\nThe ex boyfriend letter the second front door investigation the Rachel Mitchell Report she has a solid yes I'm cabinet unless the FBI corroborate stocked or for that is very different from yielding to Jerry ... you know black male about impeachment she just saying I'm a yes is that what you're hearing\nTo find that for you is what what I'm hearing\nRepublicans Republicans are standing strong every one I ever talked to they are saying ... percent corroborating evidence of Dr Ford in this report they're staying strong with cabin on\nYou know look I think that's the assumption I think that um you know Senate Republican leadership believes that that apps and corroborating evidence that that that that he is going to be confirmed that they're going to have the votes um\nBut I I think that there is sort of a a a an unspoken built in caviar in everyone's mind here that that um\nYou know corroborating evidence is is potentially in the eye of the older you are and and I know that that sounds strange but we're living in a really strange time and this is a very strange situation and I do think that there is a potential for some finding that is not\nCorroborating any legal sense but that is a you know a significant in undermining\nPortions of of judge Kavanaugh's a sworn testimony and that that could change things for for some senators for some Republicans I'm not saying that's going to happen but I I certainly don't think that anybody is closing off that possibility if they're being honest about\nYou know the audio and transcript the journey urge to be posted pretty soon but I'll tell you what struck me Tim\nShe is not going for that little margin you tried to go there shooting which is you know drinking or throwing ice in a bar that just irrelevant or she wants corroborating evidence of the assault which launched all of this everything else is post facto to her and doesn't matter\nAnd I actually believe Republicans will be wiped out if they do not confirm Kavanaugh within ... in the absence of an explanation corroborating Dr Ford story I really think they will be wiped out in a way the revolt will be selling math\nBecause what I hear and pick up is is just passion like I haven't seen in two years you know Trump is as a shattered the Republican Party it's altogether that is what Lindsey said last night\n[laughter] look I I I Would certainly agree with you there I I think that the Republican base is probably more unified at this moment that it has been in a in the Twenty one months of the Trump presidency does far I I don't think there's any question and I and I do think that just as a\n... as a matter of of sort of delivering and as a matter of motivating and mobilizing I'm politically yeah there's there's no question uh that that they are now in a position where and I think for folks on the hill even some folks\nRobert cause he hosts why shouldn't we can review on friday night he who is a member of the Washington Post great repertory okay my colleague

that he was being criticized by the blue Bible people for mocking her I didn't think it was mark here I thought was attacking her testimony but I think he knew what he was doing and it wasn't a ref what do you think\nAbout the when the look on your show or ... or ... or the clock at all I'm an Asian vote on her blog\nOn law because we always talk about Ninety Ninety One with a bomb the mighty mighty young woman in the ... product circle the women independent voters are going to be on the bottom of the nation brought all turn out in November but you're in ... in\n... women are ... well\nThe anecdotal evidence is always evidence of anecdote says as a law professor I Know you can't go foreign anecdotal evidence but I'll tell you what let's play Lindsey Graham on Hannity last night cut number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats I think they're toast all of them all up all of them politically\nYou know the only thing that are open seemingly the even though there are tests that they don't know that Robert Joni Ernst with just on she confirmed that they got polling if they enter and see the show Donnelly mansion hide care McCaskill all falling and I think that's going to impact congressional races as well\nA fucking Joyce would need what they call you on like Donald Indiana running supporting President Trump supporter pilot a what a thriving in the in talking about the need for a border wall\nYeah he knows the Heidi Heitkamp another thought that they vote or a\nLiquid ... or ... or ... on\nThe current political down on a a need to get the vote or an independent voter\nWho made like love and all of a puzzle in ... and the following year but they also have their ... in the rye love and it's a perfect storm for them and and not by Graham in San Marcos point he loved it going across the Romney eight plus some one of them go at this point\n[noise] I also like Saturday and see is often forgotten I learned that from a ... a Martin back in the day of Harvard that you always have to look at polling data and find out whether an issue how people responded an issue but how motivating it is\nI think the cabinet issue is I didn't have any parallel in my experience back the Clarence Thomas it's even more intense than that I was only a weekend house back Clarence Thomas day\nThe intensity it set off and I think Robert it is because of the unfairness of it I and I got one of the woman called I got this a lot on Monday I have a teenage son I'm worried about my teenage son\nBut but it's just his daughters I really do think it's about parents of kids watching these daughters be tortured if you pick that up\nI mean you see this visceral raw across the country\nBut you do see a lot of ... uh obviously anecdotal is well mothers and they worry about this on the father is all worried about their daughters mothers worried about their daughters\nWhat's happening is that the cultural divide it beyond Cavanaugh I mean these gender debate or or in this country I mean he did on line with talk about men right you didn't arrive commentators like Jordan theaters in Toronto psychology\nWho talks about really protect the modern society\nAnd he just all different kind of come into the Kavanaugh nomination that are really starting it's kind of deep cultural of aging about what's really happening in American Life that are ... are under siege about something more than ... button from a ride in a way\n[laughter] now let's talk a little bit about reporting I'm Joni Ernst does not know when the FBI supplemental will be arriving I've heard probably today with a vote on culture tonight or or the filing of culture tonight do you have reporting on that Robert Costa\n... all of our reporting at the post is that the FBI is pretty much you know and\nThought probably take\nThrough the end of today Thursday\nTo finish it up a mountain cost McConnell wants to get the vote on the week and it's thought to be done but once we interviewed my idea of the Arab and others are pretty much it yet\nAnd so it is possible it will be filed tonight then it's thirty hours until you can vote on cloture and then thirty hours to the final vote I think it'd be seated next week [laughter] have you heard of any Republican announcing they are not voting for cabin on\nThis point but it's not clear yet whether the federal there's been briefed on finding the ... report on potential from the public at any comic contradictory they could raise red flags\nIt's certainly for different things you talk on the road but with the episode of all the word for word was not a lot of evidence\nAbout what happened in the early Nineteen eighty they're not made public aid tell me may be able to eat ... nomination afloat but even if what if something like the
