Hugh Hewitt show brought to you by the outlook on line and huge savings on the items you need and want it's a big deal the online dot com\n[noise] welcome\nBack to you and in the early ... joined by David I'm director of the Washington Examiner you also see him on CNN David Early voting begins intend to the next week next week in Tennessee you just about a story Marsha Blackburn got a big town ... because of the cabinet hearings why\nWild because it's sort of awake and they sleep you will public vote but more than that\nEspecially in Tennessee with the bread and that is kind of a unicorn Democrat who who were public is really do like in Tennessee\nAnd really did have a record of then president is that it it sort of brought out in the election which is if you're voting for bread and your ability or you know possibly a Democratic Senate so Marsha Blackburn had I had a hard time making that case for all sorts of reasons\nAnd the camera is you just basically make the case for her\nAnd it helps Tennessee revert to its standard partisanship that we would expect to see in a presidential election\nAnd that's what it's been such a big deal in the Senate races which are taking place\nIn Republican states like Trump and that's why it has been such a problem or Senate Democrats and why it has probably take in the Senate off the table for them so they just you know the U.S does this\nDoes the atmosphere in about ten days are so\nLow birth back to the need for what it is and this term cycle has been and I would lose that from happening because they've seen it before and\nIf they have the Access Hollywood tape and mid October and three weeks later Trump was elected so [noise] I don't like to make blanket predictions but right now this is why it's looking really good for black or in Tennessee and Republicans in others than it is\nI think when you're able to make the argument that ... vote for ... is a vote for Schumer is a vote for Dianne Feinstein is a vote for Cory Booker is a vote for Sheldon Whitehouse and it's there is a vote for Mazie Hirono that it's very easy to remind people\nThat for thirty days it's hard to do that for a year but it's very easy to do that for thirty days and I don't think it just tendency I think North Dakota is locked up\nI think Donald he's having trouble Holly had a big surge [noise] and now we have a hurricane down in Florida Rick Scott is going to be all over doing the Rick Scott thing he's very good at this I think it's going to help him to am I missing any places where it's helping\nWell look I\nI'm helping Ted Cruz in Texas it's helping\nRepublican Senate candidates anywhere where the state and inclined to vote for a Republican but where you know per atmosphere reasons and for candidate raised in the states will flirting with Democrats I look I I was in Indiana and North Dakota in August that I thought that those two candidates\nAre those two Democratic it's almost Donnelly and hike camp or troubled but Dolly and hanging around the high camp I think it's been behind this they just really\nIs a duck punch a Donnelly those and hanging around this in theory should help on\nA creates a distance we'll see if it does I'm Jon Tester in Montana the other one who has managed to\nWhen he's always a very good candidate to sway people underestimate him he had kept distance between him and Rosendale an outlook Neal is caught him and I think that this has helped so anywhere where the playing field is designed to elect Republicans I'm an intellect than easily especially I think this is going to help in swing states like Florida\nI think it's an open question because the atmospheric are still generally favor Democrats and this is a state that swings with the wind it's one of the reasons why I think when you look in Ohio and Pennsylvania the Senate races are still off the table\nYou know they have it is eight or a lead allegation that Democrats were using as a talking point but the mob rule it's not that I was angry about that before I was I was shocked when they broke through the barricades at the Supreme Court the videos that they had the mob in Portland went viral yesterday I just think people have had\nIt with the intimidation politics of the lap pay really have just had it and are going to vote Republican or a beer to that more than they were going to vote against Donald Trump for his occasional cruelty and his bowling a China shop stuff they're really angry at those politics on the hell am I right am I wrong\nWell I think it depends on where the voters are I think you're right where the voters are inclined to vote Republican and where the partisanship is designed that way I think you still have a lot of house district and you have some of these swing states where the
