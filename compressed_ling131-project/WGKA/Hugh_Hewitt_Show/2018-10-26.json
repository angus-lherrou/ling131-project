President I Am a plane man and I get my living by the plow\nI'm not used to speak in public but I beg your lead to say a few words to my brother plowed joggers in this house and it goes on to say that when I saw this constitution I found that it was a cure for these disorders it was just such a thing as wanted\nI got a copy and I read it over and over I had been a member of the convention of former on state constitution and learn something of the checks and balances the power\nAnd I found them all there and I did not go to any lawyer to ask his opinion we have no lawyers in our town and we are do well enough without my for my own opinion and I'm pleased with this constitution that so the Democratic impulses in a joke developed that they eight thousand people those conventions that ratified this document\nAbsolutely of the conversation that you and I are having who is exactly what I Want dialogue argument that you and I would disagree about originalism ... and the constitution and doing so in a ... way of making ... ... and that\nWas such a divided people now we're all living in our own little apps on our own little bubbles and the ability to reach across a space between us and have a coherent argument is an exactly what I'm trying to do in the book\nWhere this is where the public historians come in like you and and Doris Kearns Goodwin was on earlier this week and I've got General McChrystal coming on public history as you say it expands your memory it gives you a longer memory and dust better arguments what'd you picked up a couple of minutes to tell me or tell the audience why it's so important that they read popular history\n[noise] well I think that they should read history that can speak it you know beyond that the categories that academic sometimes occupy I'm a on a card carrying the story of a bad and and the ... and the\nA and too many historians are only writing to each other and they've created narrower and narrower definitions of American history\nA little amount of the the Americans who couldn't even past civics test that a new a new immigrants to America has to pass as is astounding and\nYou're right it does expand our memory back in

more and the historical literacy of the population will allow us I think to break through the conduct cross ... containers\nI and I think that is actually I read David Brooks piece earlier this week

percent\nOf us who want to have that and to move the ball forward I don't think you\nKnow the times I get pessimistic and uh I'm a realist and I'm\n... I mean when you get on the Internet and listen to what people are saying you know it's hard to believe in what they've called the better angels of our nature and I'm a and so voices like yours are helping us to recover the end\nAnd I really do think that\nIn the in the end argument is the answer um it's it's not that that that's what the constitution really is it's a crane where are you know it doesn't it doesn't provide you with a clear set of answers it provides you with the ... which we argue that each generation needs to be able to do that on its own terms\nAnd Madison's example is I think maybe the best because he's not gifted as Hamilton is with charisma or physical size he hasn't got Washington's rectitude ... are alleging but he just works at it he just works at it every day yet\nFor any ... thinks like a lawyer even though he's a unlike Hamilton or at others what ... percent he's not trained as a lawyer or he just thinks that way and um any you know he can change within

morning\nFlorida's governor Rick Scott is calling in from the sunshine state governor Scott welcome in the first question is how is the recovery in the panhandle going\nWas that a lot of people working really hard with down to about twenty three thousand or something wanting a real good I always knew better\nDown but only three thousand people without power right now owns in businesses that are so well on goal is to get most everybody back on except\nThere'll be some ... ... by a burst of November of course our next week so with our utility company had annoy National Guard our response I called up or down number National Guard you sneezed on them over the home and she'll join us again so\nWe've got a lot of work to do a yesterday I was with vice president Pence which was a good day because he came down to announce that the president's committed to rebuilding Jindal air force base which is just to the east of Panama City um that is a got a great military presence got a two and a half\nBillion dollar impact on our local economy there are some course about twenty thousand jobs so that was a big deal we went to a a church that was providing\nA a really nice lunch to our National

back\nYou we build stronger people love to live in Florida we got the nicest people helping each other down here and got so many people coming from all over the country are serving food helping people parks on their house and it's really nice\nYou know I've got a lot of support for ... over the last couple of weeks here because they they go down and do the heavy lifting I'm sure you run into him but\nThat Kendall announcement is huge Chuck Todd and I were talking when the hurricane had how homestead never came back after Andrew twenty five years ago and sort of get the confirmation from the president the vice president DOD that ... is coming back that's a big deal to everyone in that community\nIt's a big deal and the truth is they they need to come back and source of military mission you know we we don't have drilling in the eastern half of the uh the eastern part of the Gulf there that allows\nA military chief test I'm test different um pieces of equipment they they can do a lot of training there which is where you know where the air force or the navy that's where you're trained to learn to be a pilot and so they can do it on an interrupted by a\nCommercial activity there so it's it's an important a mission for the for the United states we have twenty military bases and reunify the man and as governor I've tried to do everything I can to help them fulfill their mission\nAnd make sure all the military members enter veterans have all the resources they need to ... everybody want to live in this day\nNow governor Rick Scott let's turn to politics or I've heard it said that you would be running away with the Senate race but for the fact Michael wiped out the voting ability many Floridians in the panhandle I read an executive order you sent out\nAre all Floridians going to be able to vote because they want to send you to Washington as their senator they really do want to replace Bill Nelson I Want to send you but they're going to be able to vote and you know there aren't any school to go to\nA huge ... what was done is we had eleven counties impacted and some some in fact a little bit less like a with a state capitals the county\nSo we sat down with their supervisors elections there ... or by county and we said how's how can we work with you to make sure you know people have the right to vote and they can get out there so you can vote by absentee or by mail um in our state um\nYou can do it by early voting and you can do it on election day and we've worked in every county to make sure of that you eat out the vote what they did in Lake County which is animosity they have five\nSupervisor lets you wanted to do there has to stop by big mega sites because that's what we've got\nA more damage where there's a lot of people and so the supervisors doing of elections down there is doing TSA\nI'm just making sure everybody um gets out to vote and and clearly\nYou know campaigns will go and make sure people know where to vote because what happens a lot of people they wake up unless they say okay I'm going to go vote and they just go to the last place they loaded on the last time and so there are everybody's working hard to let people know that you might have to go into a different place\nAnd so how do you feel about the campaign right now I I look at the our CPA average in three of the last four polls have you had but you're busy doing hurricane recovery it's not really a campaign mode and the Rick Scott style which is a hundred and ten percent or how you juggling these facts\nBut my first job is to take their I'm ... I'm a governor so it's like this and so that's what I've been doing my wife has gone a campaign for me I\nWhen I had wanted to run back and when you and she says that score eight honey but I hate public speaking I'm scared to death well she's been given fortified speeches a day ... and has done a great job a so she's looking there but here's why we're going to let\nIt actually becomes evident when you see her and so in her to here's the difference between the two of us\nI've been in the panhandle and been in this county jail in three or four counties today my opponent did three or four days a photo ops and he said there's nothing else I can do I wanna go back to campaign is it clear and everybody knows he doesn't want to work is not a worker\nI'm I Am and so people see that and they're losing we're going to win is they've watched for eight years that I've sat there and every day whatever whether whatever's going on I showed up and did my job\nLoss and he can't he actually won an ad in one things he's done nothing on education and that's not on the environment that did not transportation is one thing and it's become evidence and so he's the biggest example\nOf why we ought to have turned them he's been nothing in forty two years in ... in public office\nForty two years while you're at and the whole astronaut thing I actually thought he was an astronaut until someone informed me that he hitched a ride on a shuttle because he's on appropriations I really didn't think he was an answer I ... I think it's one of those things that gets into the public safety\nAnd they think you went through the whole program and all that stuff and I'm just amazed that this is my literally right I don't know that so Governor Scott what what's your agenda going to be in D.C what you want to bring to DC\nWell here's here's will give you and I'll give you why okay\nI grew up in a family I don't know my dad I Lived in public housing going up and I watch my mom's puzzle will put on table get healthcare it all the struggles that people have so when I became governor my goal was to say that the three most important things to a family\nOr one guy had a job\nAnd put to your children have to have the British patient because that's the chance to live the dream and number three you got to live in a sea change is it a little bit when you go to Washington but it's the same thing what do we do to to make the sec Hamid better for everybody\nWhat do we do to have an education system and most of the education issues are going to be done at the state level and how do we keep people safe at the federal level more but it's going to be tied tied to the military um and so my my gender ... is is to think about every family and how you make every family in America in better position\nAnd so I think it's I think it's the ... at the federal level it's gonna be the economy is going to be how do we make sure we defend the feelings of this country\nThat Governor I always tell people I Lived in California took two years ago I moved to Virginia to most diverse places in the country or Florida and California you've got lots of demographics or is he going to a greater ...\nIn parts of California the Central Valley is not particularly diverse but how do you but you did very well with the Cuban community the Latino community Puerto Rican community the African American community the or the Asian American community do very well in every community why is that\nI show up it's a simple as that\nUh I show up and I in my eyes I tell everybody on the sitting governor of the state I'm going to represent you I and so so in so I'm I'm going to focus on issues that are important to you I Know I Know for the Cuban their ... year yes\nYou're yes although at rock bottom and sit and building also did with regard to Raul Castro is just wait and they're furious that their country has basically been decimated by by a ... and the Nicaraguan so furious will happen um with are taking what he's killing peaceful protesters and then with regard to Puerto Rican\nWhen they had Maria I showed up the next eight times we brought resources we brought 'em I sent them highway patrol vehicles National Guard um utility workers to show up and do your job and take care of everybody when you do people say look a guy cares about me for him\nWe could we could use that and some other campaigns Governor Scott it looks like you're surging it looks pretty good right now so last question what's your feeling about between the last you know we have ten days down now it's only ten days out\nOf Logan when we just got to get you know right now it was we got her message I just got to get people I don't know if everybody gets out both of them were going to have a we're gonna have a big win because people know there is a big difference so\nI was early voting underway already can people go vote today\nOn one point seven million people have already voted a bias in the early and so early start is by county so in the pan ... I think in the panhandle starts on Saturday in other parts of states already started so that people are voting that I think is what was going to be sent to like sixty five percent will be before election day\nFor all my friends in Orlando Tampa Sarasota in the panhandle all throughout Florida get out and vote early don't let it get their way into today Rick Scott go talk to governor and that was posted on on tinder when everything else that's great news at the vice president brought down there yesterday\nUh instead of Jen Psaki with Jake Tapper yesterday ... number for a place\nThat I can I also think that President George W. Bush would have done something different and President Clinton would have done something different and President George ... cents on some different\nI think we're seeing here and there are moments

pricing and good morning to you but I had to ... the pharmacy this week for the Z pack and all the other stuff that goes when you get bronchitis a tell me and I was little sticker shock that I've got good insurance what were you when the president talking about yesterday about lowering drug prices\nWill you great to be with you again uh yesterday morning here it ha chess we actually revealed data showing that in one of the most important parts of our drug program Medicare pays one hundred and eighty percent\nOf what Europeans and Japanese pay for the same medicines under deals that farm it gives them and the president came over here at age eight jets and he said that's going to stop that for the free riding gonna stop we're ... we're going to be done without paying sticker price and that part of the Medicare program\nAnd we're going to get the benefit of these foreign prices here in America\nIt'll save Seventeen billion dollars over five years but the program and three and a half billion over five years for patients like you when you get your drugs\nNow six days are a lot of people know you're very fine lawyer you are what we call a litigator having clerked for the right honorable Michael ... who am I correct about that\nIndeed I was his first Locklear okay so\nI Want him to be our next attorney general but there's a litigator you all have concern for what the statute permits you to do and whether the regulations which will go through the nose for comment ... are going to be labeled an overreach and you know the big pharma spends a hundred and Seventy one million bucks so you're a lobbying so you're going to get\nA zillion comments during the notice income and face when do you think uh and without pre judging the outcome ha chance we'll be able to issue a regulation from the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovation to implement this proposal\nOur plan is to have this up and running by the end of twenty Nineteen so the end of next year or the beginning of twenty twenty\nWe're going to take input but let me be I Want to be really clear view we're going to be doing this we're gonna get input to do it the right way but we're going to end of this foreign free riding that's not debatable it's gonna it's gonna happen but we'll do it the right way and we're doing it open and transparent process\nTo which overseeing around corners and doing everything right because we want to make sure this works for hospitals\nWill make sure it works for for our providers for our doctors and want to make sure absolutely works for patients and will do whatever it takes to\nMake it work for all of them so they save money they have access and we stopped us for free riding in and help farmers taking advantage of us\nNow senator or is there I agree with all that but I go back to the fact I think by the time your regulars out and into the courts Chevron doctrine well I've been greatly limited so I expect the Supreme Court to look very very closely at the statute under which you are proceeding\nHave you already done that as a litigator and can and persuaded yourself but you got the authority to do what essentially it looks like a referencing to me I'm mid point average and like the real clear politics average of drug prices and implement that as the will buy price preventive care\nThat that that's correct you know um I actually have through a what's called the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovation\nExtremely broad authority to test alternative methods of making payments and Medicare to improve patient quality access and affordability and efficiency of the program\nThat's why this is a demonstration project that will take place in fifty percent of America it has very clear metrics to be studied really\nI have not the least bit of concern about our legal authority to do this to do this project\nThat's very good to know which ... now what about the Americans are on the other fifty percent of the country they're not going to be happy [laughter]\nWell you know I'm using as you just said I'm using the full authority that I've got I Do have to test a proposition I Can't just do it\nAcross the board for everyone now if Congress like this idea they can do it tomorrow across America I'm going I'm happy to work with them if they're interested in that up but for the rest of Americans who are not in the fifty areas the fifty percent of the country that will be doing this\nThey're still going to see a benefit because as we the way the system works as we all down the reimbursements in this fifty percent of America\nThe silly way that we currently fixed prices in this program will also pulled down the reimbursements as a result in the other fifty percent of the country not as much but they will still get some of that benefits\nAnd so to conclude secretaries or of health and Human Services you've got a new proposal it's going to notice and comment rule making you expect to have it in operation by twenty Nineteen what you expect a health care premiums to look like in the year at\nRejoined the men and talk about his brand new ... third with ... and Jason men gown\nLeaders myth and

... talk for the new millennium six pairs of leaders compare plus one stand alone I thought I cannot wait to see the Thirteen are\nBut I didn't allow myself to go to the table of contents I wanted to be surprised are you still and I bought my surprise are you still surprised by the leaders you and ... and men going chose to profile\nYou I actually am you know I felt we were going to come out with short of a more expected political leader or a business leader group but we tried to get diversity and what they did and their sex is in their backgrounds and whatnot and and I feel really good about it\nWell you said we lack I'm quoting here now we lack the leadership equivalent of a general theory of relativity so you set out to outline and underscore the complexities and I finished the book and I thought to myself I don't have a formula and I don't think he wanted me to have a formula\nThat's exactly right you know we we were writing this book and partway through we came out with the realization that leadership is it what we think it is\nAnd studying history we realize it never has been\nAnd show as we went back to deconstruct what leadership actually constitutes weed or it's not something that leaders possess that they\nAim at followers and they make things happen it's really like an interaction between the actual factors followers and leaders and it's always changing and therefore endlessly complex\nSo now I Want a war in the eyes I'm Talking about some specifics from leaders myth and reality so if you want to be surprises I was you could just turn it off and go to the book at Amazon dot com leaders Mitt than reality by Stanley McChrystal Jeff ... and a case of men don't\nPut if you don't mind getting a little bit of a spoiler let let me just say the biggest surprise for me is to find rubs fear and Zarqawi at the middle of your book but boy does it make sense when you're done with reading about these two villains they were villainous leaders of extraordinary ability\nAnd effectiveness that's exactly right and we we called it was jealous\nBecause their strength came from ... G of their conviction and the fact that they wouldn't waiver from what they believed even though we might think what they believed was completely wrong it gave them a magnet for followers\nI also
