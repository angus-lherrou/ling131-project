problem it's called profit um they've ever made a dime\nAnd you know they're still not even close to making a dime\nAnd I don't see how this I mean the only thing that they actually make money on his

Sarasota won over by Arcadia that to provide power for almost a whole a subsection over over there in Sarasota County as well as over there\nAnd just soda county and folks and speaking of Chris my ... to watch soccer on Wall street Okay Steve Forbes magazine a owner and publisher Steve Forbes says painted kind of a bleak picture because he said that if the Dems when\nThe fall election it looked like the Grinch stole Christmas what's she talking about\nIt won't be I Will get Christmas coming up and everybody is kind of a a you know excited about this year spending season businesses are hiring um if you get a a change in direction where Democrats take over on the talk of higher taxes and\nBack to hire regulations on all the things that they're pushing for all of a sudden you're going to see people start to be cautious and you'll see spending going the opposite direction and you'll definitely got to change\nA in a way that the wind is blowing very very quickly so yeah you know you could look at a holiday season ... talks about the rich they were still at Christmas Holiday season that looks to be booming might not be\nNow we've got the uh moving to Tokyo race going on down here with Ron descendants of Republican going against Andrew Gillum the Democrats are right now Gillum has been leading in every poll that's been done for the past month to month and a half a the the leaders anywhere from two points to a seven point you take your pick the average is four and a half\nPoints according to real clear politics bought in an interview that was done recently\nWith a CBS reporter\nAndrew Gillum sat there\nAnd lied to the floor to people when he when he tried to deny\nFlorida's incredible economic success because when he was pressed to acknowledge import is booming economy and historic lows in employment specifically where the reason that\nWe're really going on and Governor Scott has done a good job he said well the reason that unemployment is low is because people are working more than one job where I heard that before\n[noise] that'd be a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez making them really really I mean again if you go to vote for a guy that is that stupid knows that even know how the employment numbers\nAre calculated it just how more ironic that is God Bless you I mean I don't know what to tell you I mean listen I ... you're you're obviously you're not\nTo go out and vote 'em you're not really much you don't have a clue and how the world works you know the unemployment numbers are not\nFactor in based upon how many jobs people are doing I mean it's absurd\nNow this is a flat out while you're absolutely right and the bureau of Labor Statistics\nI remember I don't think it's a lot I just don't think he's just got that right yeah I I don't think I think that you know I just think that a lot of these people they believe that you know their own nonsense well I don't think that he's lying I just think that he's up right\nYou mentioned the way that it was figured the bureau of Labor Statistics calculates unemployment using a pretty simple for real or if a person is working at a job they're employed and if they're not and they are not\nCounted twice if they worked multiple jobs all ... and now this guy or implying if you work a second job that's our come unemployment is low because you've got all these people back to work\nAgain and he doesn't even know how it's done I mean it's it's like they're not that smart they don't really know they just read off or whatever uh there are being told to stay off some sort of facts\nSolid facts don't matter damn ... do not matter\n... again they have their own set you understand this is what they're they're fed by their handlers and it's it's not nothing to do with being truthful so it doesn't matter if if there are people that you vote for him leave that way they're going to\nStep up them what are you going to do that I mean there's all the time you can you can go on the air you aren't going to the air we can go to present you know reality of people don't want to believe in reality what do you what are we supposed to\nWrite and of course politifact you know who they are right\nOh yeah of course yeah they redid this one pants on fire and Gillum is just kinda backtracking from it\nOr what if he's dead or not but she just said he he was using the the fact that he had it is has a hand as fingertips using the fact that he had on hand and he called them back she called the facts are not facts alternative\nFacts I guess whatever\nYeah but in the meantime you know we've got the senator road rage down here with Rick Scott and Bill Nelson Rick Scott who's just cruising along um uh he could very easily win that race of the race were held today um I Would say that overall it's still kind of even Stephen but uh\nThe numbers lately have favored Rick Scott\n[noise] it well we'll see I mean it ... about the mid term without a doubt out you know traditionally ah you know the opposition party 'cause he's the executive branch picks up the\nUh during the mid term I the only time that I I think that that didn't happen was in two thousand and two when the Republicans did very well um but uh you know again I I'm I'm curious to see your based upon the way the economy's going how people are going to react to it and how they're going to go with a voting\nModern American politics will the new McCarthyism\nWill slander as in the seat analyze directed at judge Brett Kavanaugh to succeed but well enough decent men and women in the United States Senate step up and say no moss this is not acceptable\nI understand the motivation of Jeff Flake\nHe just did not seem to understand that the left\nWould not in good faith undertake additional inquiry into the credible allegations against judge Kavanaugh as they were termed by Democrats I don't think there are any credible allegations against judge Kavanaugh but Democrats do they believe that\nJudge ... for it as a credible allegation in my world of belied it's not credible to be an on corroborated accusation from thirty plus years ago\nThat as many internal inconsistencies that have been teased out over the weekend that anyone who is focused on it would agree simply falls apart under close scrutiny and the allegation ms Ramirez don't even rise to the level of allegation they are a simple smear\nSo the FBI will be busy with the mirrors allegations there's nothing more to be done with Dr Ford she testified under oath\nAnd her testimony has no to the Senate there are no other witnesses as she was admitted they can't talk to Mr judge took up all the other boys from Georgetown Prep should be done today\nShut it majority leader McConnell to acquire file for cloture tonight which sets in motion thirty hours of debate\nSo that on Wednesday they would vote on the motion to\nA close debate\nAnd if it passes with fifty one votes to fifty three votes or we may mansion and hike camp or left\nBut under the mansion standard that you need more than an accusation I expect him to vote to proceed that will go to the Senate for final vote on Thursday that's what I'm hoping for\nAll weekend long I watched amused\nThat Democrats attempt to change\nThe focus from the FBI's investigation as to whether there are as anything else to the credible allegations that Democrats are credible but which I I reject\nAnd that means the Yale allegation and the doctor blog report allegation there's nothing else by the way they referred for prosecution one of the hits on Kavanaugh Betty rape someone on a boat in Rhode Island that person's going to jail because they called Sheldon Whitehouse and that idiot\nDo people Rhode Island you have an idiot representing him in the sense that idiot bleak that to the press and they put that out there again Brett Kavanaugh has two daughters ten and fourteen\nAnd they switched over\nTo a week on a salt on the fact that he was angry at being accused of being a rapist Saturday Night live when all that despicable just despicable\nBrett Kavanaugh had been rated highly qualified fully qualify the highest rate maybe has and the left has been working all we get along to get that back because the left intervened and the person with the president ... friday\nWithout talking to the idea of comedy as usual standard they've got the highest qualification for ratings he taught forever at Harvard He is known by everybody in the legal community I don't know about that from the beginning what my first choice but I Will not let any stove go on thrown against the McCarthy I ...\nI Know McCarthyism does by the way it was directed over the weekend I'm not going to tell you the details\nAt a young left wing journalist\nOr young left wing journalist on Twitter came under assault\nWith just a few keystrokes\nFind out what you did at ... school to this person\nYou move from the Rosenbergs who were treasonous to Alger Hiss perjured himself because he was a a traitor genuine honest to God communist agents to accusing and blacklisting people in Hollywood on the basis of mere accusation that tail gunner Joe stop you know it was set up a tail gunner Joe Margaret Chase Smith\nFirst woman senator senator from Maine\nStood up to Joe McCarthy\nThan I Am hoping that every Republican follows the Margaret Chase Smith example and will have nothing to do with this I was disappointed when Jeff Flake\nFaster the FBI investigation I wanted to move forward but I Know he's a decent fair guy and he thought this would help that didn't\nJeff is continually disappointed by the people around him I Am disappointed and Chris Coons in an Angus King for not denouncing the smears I don't expect them to vote for judge cabinet or they they would prefer to have a liberal\nThey would prefer to have another Elena Kagan they're sort of my are but they lost the election\nI expect every Republican to vote for him and I expect Joe mansion Heidi Heitkamp to represent their states or they will be defeated I think they're going to lose anyway but they will most certainly be defeated\nYou need to call your senator two two two to four three one two one two two two to four three one two one and tell them whatever way they are voting on Capitol they need to denounce\nMalignant evil slander against him Tom Cotton was on face the nation we have today cutting number twenty three\nJudge Kavanaugh hundred percent denies these allegations there's not a single bit of corroborating evidence every evidence that we do have to include the people that miss for herself name either don't recall this instead or they deny that had happened did you find this is for a doctor foreign kind of\nMiss Ford was sympathetic and she was to see her she's been victimized by the Democrats in this process drawn they portrayed her own requests for confidentiality they live just to the media the last minute because they were on a search and destroy mission for ... Kevin you said when we last talked in November I think it's important that women feel they can come forward\nThat's a good change and the norms and the expectations of our society\nA woman came forward here uh and you're saying basically she said nothing credible how can women come forward if when they knew there they're told they're not credible\nShe came forward confidentially designed Feinstein time Feinstein did not share that with the proper authorities Chuck Grassley her counterparts with him she served for decades and the FBI that could ever viewed as a matter of confidentiality confidentially then they leave it to the media I was reading the circus environment you're saying for the last two years\nNow he went on ... number twenty four\nOn first off let's understand why we had to have this hearing\nMiss for these allegations in a confidential letter to die by him sign in July shortly after ... Kavanaugh was nominated the very not he was nominated Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader said that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination and that's what happened for three months the Democrats have turned the advice and consent process into a search and destroy mission\nThese allegations are completely supported by any evidence what evidence there is to eight thirty six year old climb\nAll support judge Kavanaugh's denial but then the Democrats have disgrace this process and the United States Senate and the orchestrated smear campaign of character assassination they've run against judge Kavanaugh their argument of course was that doctor for an asset his health and confidentiality and that they tried to do that\nAnd that's what it was ... I don't know no no no no John let me talk to you about that when I talk to your listeners about your views about that\nThere is a well established process of confidentiality on the committee Dianne Feinstein could have show that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI who could have discreetly conducted\nThis parade in July and August without betraying misfortune competent says and they have betrayed her they pointed her lawyers Who Lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her all that now all that water under the bridge\nThose lawyers gonna have to face a D.C more investigation and the ... their misconduct Dianne Feinstein and her staff is going to face an investigation for why they leak that all this could have been done to ... to ...\nAnd hundreds of hundreds of times every year and there's this year it can be\nAnd then more Tom Cotton ... twenty five he's drawn any impact this entire episode has had on women's willingness to come forward and report sexual assault try and courage them all to do immediately after it happens\nIt's caused by the Democrats is caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respected her request for confidentiality smell when you come forward with an accusation as serious as the U.S it has to be tested against the evidence and against ...\nAnd we would have known that confidentially inside of a new sheriff may already wasting its time\nI don't know what I don't know what the FBI is going to find that the committee has not already found\nThat the committee staff has already interviewed all the witnesses that missed one sided they interviewed miss Ford and judge Kavanaugh for six hours after judge and she sent him a letter that why you interview you're not right about that\nSo they've either interview them or they receive letters under penalty of perjury I sat for nowadays are actual interview so I'd be surprised if any of these people under penalty of perjury change\nTheir statements that they've already given this year well\nRight yeah one or cut from cotton because indeed that is the bottom line you do not lie in a letter that subjects you to perjure you do not change your story when they arrived at talk in person cut twenty six\nJohn we already know what everyone who's alleged to be at the party has said they've submitted statements or been interviewed under penalty of perjury I Would be shocked if any of them change her statement under penalty of perjury to the FBI but if this makes a few senators more comfortable about going forward and voting on judge Kavanaugh is\nVery highly qualified nomination in in the face of an orchestrated democratic smear campaign then was that may end up as a good I was just cannot truthful and everything he said in his testimony I found him to be truthful throughout his testimony I found them to be turns out he he was in I found him to be

don't expect Chris Coons and Angus King or good men to stand and vote for judge Kavanaugh they would prefer a liberal to be there that's what their party believes that's what they're states believe\nI actually don't think Maine believes that the main ones Kevin are confirmed but Angus King can do what he was but I expect them to stand up and say this is disgusting what has happened to this good man\nAnd I don't expect ... cutting\nAbout how angry he is because he has a ten year old and a fourteen year old who has put up with us he is a bad he's acting like a dad and I think Chris Coons would

would feel more confident in the result will be better for Brett Kavanaugh it'd be better Supreme Court it for sure for sure for sure would be good for any Republican who's on the ballot\nYeah Mike I I have to say that I think that's how it's being perceived inside the beltway but I in my ten phone calls this morning\nI have done more reporting of women outside of the beltway that every other talking head I have seen who have been repeating both left and right both pro cabin on culture cabin on I'm actually talking to women and they they can't get through their seminar callers we know how to do under this Nineteen years\nWe know how to find first time caller who are outraged and the reporting is Contra what the blue bubbles in the newsroom believe and I don't know how we break out it is one of the things they're mad about is one point of view\nHas been wildly over represented in the media this week and I don't watch pocket because I I don't like confirmation bias I watch MSNBC and CNN and the wild over representation of anti cabinet sentiment is in fact fueling the outrage by people who think he's getting slammed\nThe only good news for him is that uh he's been\nA played by Matt Damon and you know his his permanent\n... well yeah but that also feeds into I saw that and I thought Matt Damon who at the ... you don't have to agree with me and that's who has contributed very little to the public good as far as I Know comes on and mock so good man it would be like mocking in the army McCarthy hearings chill Welsh\nMatt Damon should go and play Joe Welsh in the army McCarthy hearing and say have you know decency and the match buttering venom filled spittle flex rage because that's the parallel\nAnd it is McCarthyism Mike and I think everyone who stands by then what's a good man get smeared who has a ten year old a fourteen year old daughter and a wife and parents they are complicit in this that's why\nI you can tell I'm furious I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh I've never spoken to him in my life but I'm a dad and I just cannot imagine this\nYou another piece of reporting we just popped up on ... years and this is related to the ... idea a swan is picked up that we could well have worked for a while if for some reason the Kavanaugh's nomination does not\nWork out and do you add to that that a Democratic Senate certainly is a more likely than it was a month ago\nThere was no sentiment inside the White House for nominating somebody that Democrats would confirm Swann has gone is she a quote from a source with direct knowledge of the president's thinking who said if Kavanaugh doesn't make it and the Senate flips I think the court is for work for the next two years\nWell is that it's not going to put a ... and uh I don't doubt that that is true I I Believe that if if the Senate flip I don't think they can from anyone but I Will tell you this ah the president would recess appointment someone who had nominated between then and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski I just don't believe they're going to be complicit in this I still think it's going to be fifty three forty seven\nBecause Joe mansion and Heidi Heitkamp will lose their seats almost inevitably Joe Donnelly is going to lose any Bill Nelson is going to lose Josh Hawley got a two point lead over\nA Claire McCaskill it's going to grow in Missouri ... this morning\nJust think the Senate Democrats in the Senate are in the Bible and they really don't know what's going on out there these red states Mike Allen and I don't know if it don't you find that we haven't seen any polling\nGoing on on Kavanaugh and which way the public is moving the only thing I saw was in West Virginia where eight out of ten people believe Kevin I should be confirmed\nIt ah what is it a point that makes you most optimistic\nAbout Republican\nJeff Flake saying that unless something new came out of my data point is is a Josh Hawley being up on Claire McCaskill Kevin Cramer extending his lead in North Dakota those are two plots to attack it all of us can comment on\nHer shoulder is true I can tell you the Republicans are moves confident of that pick up with any of them\nYeah and and so those two alone make it impossible for Democrats to flip the Senate but I think we're going to do better than that even though mansions their head of Morsi this is a this is an issue that throws not just Iraq into the pond but a hand grenade into the pond and they don't get it a ... that they honestly\nThey don't understand what they've done with this ah Mike let me let me finish with the U.S MCA\nThe president has renegotiated NAFTA nobody thought he could do that I didn't think he could do it but I don't think it's going to be even noticed because of the cabinet or a a blow up but how significant is that he successfully renegotiated NAFTA\nThis isn't a question but when it was an expected it was on his terms it is a better you'll or the U.S it's a win and nobody can say otherwise\nIt and that's exactly right and my gosh so much winning Mike Allen always a pleasure will be watching an academic\nI'm never going to get tired of it when I was hired as I Am not going to
