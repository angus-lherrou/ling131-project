a couple of months or their thoughts but whether it be a war like I said this is a great honor and a lot goes into that crack give us just example of what they're looking at when they try to choose a winter\nWhile it's a combination of hunting and conservation or we're on the hunting side they ah they look at a kind of all the continents and all the debt for all the animals and\nI you know you have to chase a\nLotta sheep and now the dangerous game and a lot of the ... the world and a lot of rats and mice and unicorns in three toed bizarre [laughter]\nI've got a burrito before we get man of war camp here\nI don't know how big is was mine is bigger right I Know yeah that's what that's normal horrible [laughter]\nWe're glad you're here with us today I Want to start with Ivan Carter because there was a college in Africa that I think is very cool you and I talk about this last year the south Africa while alive college\nSays the southern African wildlife college and what makes that so special is it's a it's a hobby where they've got to a professional hunting school but they also have a school where they it's it's a full blown college over the last Twenty years they've they've pain fourteen thousand\nWildlife protection agents forty four different countries in Africa so they they do an incredible amount of good\nThey do a lot of ecological research there and so it's a great way that the integration of really good sustainable use models professional hunting model then all of that can come together and to be honest it's a it's a very important part in Africa because it's one place\nWhere there's a lot of conversation between non hunters and hunters as about the sustainable use solutions\nAnd a lot has been done Dallas hardcore money is very important in Africa and the various projects going on there the fight against poaching you can look up in the air and in parts of Africa any given day and say that that was hard caught logo flying overhead they're looking for voters\nTo an end that's not just on the headache up to the Muslim faith but there's also a cough in South Africa ... that are all funded by people like you guys by virtue of the fact that you pay to get in half support data safari cup and many other ways a lot of that money ready does end up on the front line of these very important initiative so yeah\nAnd nothing more important than this question Ivan anytime I see you on TV all these years you're wearing a pair of boots little bitty short shorts\nAlmost saying is that like if we go on so far is that a requirement 'cause it's so\nI absolutely but it's the suffering of the show is actually a\nFamily show show [noise] family show we don't want to know where long bridge that's right or wrong for a long bridge is because I worked in fact you hot\nIt looks a lot like west Texas damage job it's rough wired and you're walking around their short proud of your legs are what ... ...\nIs there a mother and father's y'all y'all talk

every week but I Want to thank you for joining me in the ... I Hope you'll do that again next time around\nAlso want to thank my lord and savior Jesus Christ\nFor the very life that he gets the air that I Breathe and miss time spent with you see you next time job and my God Bless you and your [noise]\n[noise] now a matter of days before America decides who run the country for the next two years it's benefited from having Republican in the White House for losing the house or Senate which is a country back to the left wing lunatics\nCan you save this booming economy when eating bugs and jobs growth that we need to keep having the right judges to die or do we need to keep prices on the run this\n... given that they're fleeing theoretically the persecution this may be the first in history where the country are fleeing persecution from you march with their flag\nRight right I I said I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt disgraceful a turn back Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany\nThey weren't waving Nazi flags and singing chairman nationalist songs and talking about how they're going to transform us in the U.S in Germany the image I mean that the people are mixing up the Jewish refugees from Germany with the German American button you know\nThese people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by the government's they're they're just living in kind of crappy countries\nYou know and those countries are crappy for a reason\nUh for historical and cultural and political reasons because they never embraced ordered liberty\nThey um they ... they inherited a bad dictatorial political culture from Spain uh whereas we inherited a kind of anti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England and\nAs a result they have worse government than worse economies they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things there's a great\nLatin American economists her and her her and I think his name I turned on the court or ... I think it's ... Soto was found out this photo\nAnd that if you enforce property rights for the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from thugs and from drug lords Latin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence of it they're fleeing to America and we have a huge welfare\nBack now a lot of these people even if they ... they come in and start working their kids will grow up probably on public assistance large percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away refugees get a get a whole honey pot full of benefits from the government\nSo why don't you think is going to happen when they reach the American border\nWell my hope is that we will have the U.S military lined up and choking off the entire border and I think President Trump should to ... he's already said this is a national emergency he should start using defense funds to start constructing the wall\nYou ought to lay the he ought to lay the cornerstone of the wall gold plated with the big tea on it\nAnd start building the wall let Congress scream and yell blood judges scream and yell he should for their court orders and continue to use as authorities commander in chief to seal the border and you and take money away from gardening Afghanistan's border if necessary to guard at the United states sport or [laughter]\nThat's what we elected him for we didn't like Jeb Bush we didn't elect Nikki Haley we elected Donald Trump because we wanted to put America First out if we're going to be global policemen you know charity begins at home\nAnd there's a crucial point I think because people feel a sense of moral moral ambivalence oh these people they just want to improve their lives okay first of all that is true of half the world if you are going to say that you if you pick up in Honduras and say this sucks I'm outta here\nI'm going to the U.S up if that is enough to get you went to the U. S. gets what most of the Islamic world would like to come to\nVirtually everyone in China would like to come I bet Bangladesh Pakistan you could empty the world in the United states and uh our welfare system will be bankrupt within you know\nThirty six hours but hey at least we feel good about ourselves as we you know starved to death and watch the civil war overwhelm our country and turn it into it what I call Akaka stand like so many other parts of the world but what about the moral argument\nI think we should see our country as a larger extension of our private homes\nIf ... if somebody bags on your door and says he's homeless and demands to live in your living room you have a right to shut the door and use whatever forces required to stop someone from staying in your house and eating your food against your will the exact same thing occurs applies to us as a country is our country of common home\nThat we work on and we improve and we leave to our children were grateful our grandparents we lead to our children we judiciously accept new commerce or something to offer or\nAre we just on a giant refugee camp like the ones we see your you know in Turkey and Jordan where anybody who shows up you have to take him in and you put them on the same girl and given the same uniform and they and they gather around the same trash is you know\nTrash cans with a fire is that the future of America\nTo me politically this is gonna happen presumably right before the incredibly important congressional elections right and I I I I worry given the motor bias of the media\nThat we will just have video after video and photo after photo of some American either military person or ice person or a border guard are pushing some mom with a baby and\nThen uh it's it's it seems to me they win the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and that suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets in at a George Soros funded attorney\nYou know that that's not to forgive me John that some of the propaganda war that's winning the war I agree but the propaganda war you know me I I think one of those ... let me let me just breaking point\nIt seems to me that they win if they get in and they win if they don't get it\nAnd I don't because if they oh good I Hope you're right there's no little toys I you're right\nI think if Trump shows weakness\nIf he caves then Republicans across the country we just our hearts saying we realize the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status\nIf even Donald Trump can't say no to something this ludicrous and politically cooked up\nThen we're we're toast and I think that would depress turnout\nLine I I agree with you I agree with you I just I agree with you I'm so I think if she I dance from it'd be easier if you have to learn that\nThat will mean in picture in pictorial form that they will be fights between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us\nBecause I think people see that this is an invasion\nThey can see it the people who are going to cry\nBecause a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back\nThose people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out for for a poor and otherwise going to turn out this is a national impeachment referendum\nThe less bases all ready fanatical there they've got their their ... ready they're ready to go to the polls they've got their dead people registered to vote but left his all ready\nAt its maximum frenzy and hysteria they've maxed out\nWhat the Kavanaugh hearings did was wake up the Republican base a wake up the patriotic Americans to say wait a minute they're just they're threatening our system of government that destroying an orange adjusted oh and now they're bringing in case the doors to transform country demographically by the thousands\nAnd thousands and thousands now Newtown already dot com for the rest of that interview and sign up for the pond cast you'll get the best the talk radio every day\nMid week a cluster of bomb scares were reported that the officers in the homes of a number of Democrats among them George Soros Hillary Clinton and president Barack Obama you discuss the threat with Texas Senator Ted Cruz as you'll hear in the interview he was flirting with layer in China to switch off planes why I'm here today but enough about that enjoys like\nSenator Cruz talk to me a little bit about the nine a suspicious packages at least one of them was a real bomb out of the president's condemn if the vice presidents condemned Rod Rosenstein condemned it I'm sure you're going to condemn it\nBut the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy it's either some not in the basement where it's a hospital power messing with our election but what do you make can be attempt to blame Trump\nI Love it if the media dealing with the media does which which is any any narrative that they and twist against Trump they will do so and this is terrible I mean this is terrorism and whoever the terrorists do\nI Need to be ... you need to be prosecuted needs to be put in jail for a long long time and a an that'll happen you know it's interesting you remember some months ago uh we we had the bomber in ... ah ... throughout all stood and and\nI met with uh the ... the FBI we're leading the ... or ... and at the federal law enforcement has for men to resources to put\nA bear shifted to track him down in terms of ... to the bomb I go there I'm sure they're analyzing all of those now would catch this guy's going to put it behind bars but but it is long violence is always role\nOr wherever it occurs on the political spectrum light you know we saw tragically a year ago a phrase gunman coming to Washington DC\nOr the object of a shooting Republican Congress and and and ultimately go into the irrational baseball practice and and and cheating in nearly daily elites and and as it should not be part of our political discourse disagreement is fine even healthy to disagree on policy issues\nAs American inches closer to election day twenty Eighteen voter interest is extremely high especially among Republicans one of the comedy scenes among Democrats that was the claim of Republicans are using voter id to ... ... vote\nAnybody ever asked minorities about this

twenty sixteen the majority of minorities support voter ID laws\nDoesn't mean that they voter ID laws aren't racist right doesn't mean the art disproportionately negatively affect the people of color it just means that people will color too stupid to realize\nAccording to Gallup Seventy seven percent of Americans Hispanics and Seventy seven percent of blacks support voter ID laws quote the figure is essentially the same among white eighty one percent back voter ID laws into quote\nYou don't know anybody that doesn't have ID and if you know somebody doesn't have ID does that person not have the ability to\nGet id and if you don't have id you really think that\nSuch a person's motivated to vote in the first place army Horowitz went out to ask white people what they thought about voter ID laws and on and on and on these a white college kids dot the voter ID laws were racist why because they thought black people were just two incapable or stupid to get id\nKevin opinion voter ID laws there for you maintain their voter id law their way to perpetuate clean cut down on that you say there was as far as as long as a racist for sure some of these are less\nLikely to have state IDs minority voters are less likely to have the kinds of I described or require them to be some\nPeople don't live in areas which easy access to the employees are the place where they can get identification you can always get 'em over the Internet and also with that make it difficult for people to pick\nIt up yeah you have to have access to the Internet you have to be able to pay an Internet service provider for certain things you would think\nThat it's harder for black people to go on line they don't have the knowledge of how like how that works for me and I said I said I can they don't really know that they're not aware\nNow here and he's Harlem black people their thoughts on what you just heard\nYou have ideas always said I Do carry id you know what anybody any black person doesn't carry I Know and
