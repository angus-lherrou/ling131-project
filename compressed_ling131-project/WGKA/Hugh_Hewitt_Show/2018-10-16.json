I think she was chewing or look further than that as far as uh she was going to do kind of ... people kind of by surprise to some degree or even have you know Michelle Obama come out kind of what he's saying here you know kind of condemning what are some of these people are saying but uh\nYeah we're we're seeing it on the streets now\nA that's for sure the or weren't looking Portland club in New York and the Upper East side in public and club much probably Republican club on the Upper East side was a windows were smashed in a building was defaced the locks were glued big mess\nOver there and we're starting to see more and more of this and I I predict that that's it's the natural\nProgression evolution a leftist movements is it always ends up and violence\nWhile they finally got out there and block the streets in Portland antifa and the Portland police came along and guess what they drag them all out of the street and arrested in every one of them\nI'm white and realized that they cause for a while they weren't doing it\nYou know they didn't have yesterday they did yesterday they got out there and blockbuster yep they got up there and block the main street and boom the police showed up and I'm told him to leave that didn't leave and then they grabbed every one of them and some of them they had to drag out of there and are you in you know got a little bit rough but it is what it is but\nRemember must have been some pressure from the governor on the on the uh the mayor there who was consistently had fanned out orders to allow the sci fi to do whatever they want it\nWell you can't block public thoroughfares and by the way even our former attorney general Eric Holder came out and said and I quote when they go low we kick them\n[noise] yeah well and another one was a again coming out for a lot of the far left\nA pipe cactus and Bernie Sanders yesterday refused to come out and then some of the actual shelter and I you know it it is what it is you know let the people show themselves at the mob mentality and Americans are seeing them for who they are like nothing no surprise here like I said it is a natural\nEvolution of the left is always a men's up in violence and you know when they get control that's when they get really violent because then they want to tell you what to do\nYou see the video was Claire McCaskill\nAnd the conversation that was had with her talking about a Second Amendment rights and taking guns away from law abiding citizens and some of the other things that were part of the liberal agenda that if all they could do was just skipped themselves elected uh they were going to do that and oh by the way impeachment too was part of it\n[noise] yeah the project ... alright uh James O'Keefe there's a really good job but there's there's little you know surprised videos that he puts out there going all laid back member met with get the whole acorn videos yes I Do yes I Do I'm Still has another another or one she'll surprise anybody basically ... who they really are a that's based with this video\nIs all about and Claire McCaskill now than I there in Missouri uh she was looking at a British lately on our way out\nWell she's behind in the polls right now and that that I Believe in my opinion deep six they're right there\n[noise] we'll see we'll see how it plays out we'll see how much coverage that's hopefully Republicans that advantage of it but yeah but they're just showing who they are and what they believe\nIn now what I'm leading up to here is that now the polls are reflecting that after what's happened with the judge Kavanaugh saying and asking people have had a chance to sit back and watch all the stuff that's taken place a even a Taylor Swift when she came out and said what she said about Marsha Blackburn\nAnd Bob and endorse the other candidate running against her and had some mean things to say about Marsha Blackburn Marsha Blackburn now has an eight point lead she's completely reversed her fortune when Taylor Smith open their mouth\nI don't I I find that people that are actually I think you're going to go out and vote really are going to pay attention celebrities um I I got to get the you know you and far between that that might but I mean who cares what fellas this has to say about anyone cares what Alan Ball when I say about anyone\nWho really cares I I I don't understand this yet\nThey keep you know by getting involved and chime in and getting you know Bob and stuff but I think that\nAt some point in time um you're you're going to have the kind of walk away from the celebrities I think that they're going to maybe at some point they're going to think that you know what maybe these are not helping us out are benefiting us was the interesting things is even big time Democrats like block Obama a Claire McCaskill you noticed that they don't even want to have Obama come can't pay for her\nRight right and that's what happens a celebrity\nOn the left I don't work right now\nDown that's exactly what happens in those circumstances because it can hurt them or not help them but of course down here in Florida um\nWe got a very tight race going on president a President Trump was down here in the panhandle yesterday with Governor Rick Scott all they want to round and toured the area of the seven Tony area in Florida are both in the air and on the ground and then of course the president went on up in Georgia to take a look at the damaging devastation up there\nBut job a dark governor Rick Scott is not campaigning actively off to the rest of the election cycle the next step Nineteen days or whatever it is his wife and is going to go out there and do the events\nLike you've got to finish the job which is ...

represent second of all I'm Wondering if they get a self also did anybody actually say\nLet's look through all the things you ever did and said and make sure that if we're still going to do this thing that we get out in front of it may be released it ourselves talk about it\nSo I don't I don't really understand the strategy beer in terms of how they dealt with this from the beginning that it could

motivation there's no dispiriting they have not lost at all there were the only thing that has changed is a lot of conservatives are Republican voters historically Republican voters that weren't necessarily engaged at themselves maybe were dispirited just given the nature of this mid term cycle are now in\nA lot of them are now engaged and interested in voting and that's been the difference and I think the public as or anybody that wants to understand this cycle\nYou're still looking at a very energized motivated democratic voter no matter where they are and that they are you're looking at a lot of independence that many of these key house races at the very least\nAre still going to be leaning towards Democrats but in red territory where these Senate races looked like that's the ... democratic upset but I think with all of this stuff that you just mentioned was killed those back to where they generally belong whether we're talking Tennessee or Indiana and North Dakota\nNorth Dakota and ... and it's created a possibility of a much tighter race in West Virginia that people didn't think was there and it may have may have an impact in Arizona\nHere here's my counter argument when Jim Messina is tweeting and Elizabeth Warren stop it stop it stop it that is because he knows the effect of having that foolishness erupt right now Twenty one days before the actual\n... well yeah well ... well yeah but what he was talking about was modeling using the message because if you're a Democrat you want all the focus the deal President Trump but that was that's a different question whether or not these guys are still going to get out all of the book was the vote which I Believe they'll\nYou know David this is going to be interesting I I think the uh the political director at the White House the pie in just said the president's put the Republicans in the position to defy history I think the polling is beyond what we know\nIn Missouri\nCome city assigned the beltway today and joins me from abroad\nDavid Kirkpatrick of the New York times he is the author of into the hands of the soldiers\nFreedom and chaos in Egypt and the middle east you will recall about two months ago David joined me for a long interview about into the hands of the soldiers which I consider to be a must read primer on Middle East and he joins me today to talk about the disappearance of Jamal ... who is his friend David welcome what was your relationship with democracy will be\nPlayed with the source you know he was somebody I was friendly with the fact that we would have lunch together and chit chat you know not someone I Would have over to my house for dinner or something like that but you know I knew and we all knew he was he was a hard guy not to like\nThat that is what I've been told by many people I've talked to about this about\nA half an hour ago Muhammad yeah yet posted that Saudi websites says ... will some of the Fifteen people parental turkey claims were the hit team that killed ... show me close friends to ask them what they were doing an instant ball and the day 'cause she'll be died what do you see happening David well\nThe music the mood music for a while has indicated that Saudi Arabia would pin the blame on some scapegoat in their security services\nThat turkey was likely to accept that explanation or as long as Saudi Arabia acknowledged that your mouth show he had been killed inside the confidence in Istanbul\nAnd that seems like the way things are headed at this hour or last night of a well informed source or who knows what the courts up to a told me that Saudi Arabia\nHad identified the person they're going to say is responsible or he put it more earnestly and said the person that is responsible or someone in the intelligence services who knows\nCrown prince Mohammed bin Salman personally and felt like he he this person and until just had the authorization to carry out some kind of rendition and that went horribly wrong\nUm if you've been following Saudi Arabia or you've been following this story that does seem terrifically plausible but\nIt's convenient for Saudi Arabia for turkey and for the United states to find a way to move on\nAnd this is the Henry the second defense from when the English King\nSaid no one will know one read me of this troublesome praised informed his lights go off and slaughter Thomas affecting Canterbury Cathedral it works and you know the twelve hundred in the ... century I'm not sure it works today David absent public judicial proceeding that the west can pursue what do you think\nWell what does works mean you know for ... governments make do with a partial troops fairly often\nOr the quarter public opinion is a different matter I think at this point are after all that we've seen leaked by Turkish ah officials an all has been confirmed it's going to be hard for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to repair his ... his reputation\nYou know he he'd gotten pretty far in the west as a reformer and somebody was going to open up kingdom kind of an innovator and a new kind of leader for Saudi Arabia\nI think he's going to have a lot of trouble now getting the kind of selfies with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg that he's been accustomed to\nIn fact the person that has been identified to you by a good source as likely to be pointed to as the prime mover of the rendition gone bad\nUm import cage NBS in ordering the rendition does that important do you do think the royal court changes in succession [noise]\nAre two elements there first of all I think this person this ah intelligence official who's going to take the blame if that person has tried that person will be tried in that Saudi court so that's not the kind of court we're used to wear the defend it might have an opportunity to blame the ground perhaps\nA second of all a you know in the past\nA crown prince who came under this kind of a cloud might have trouble with the succession a Saturday and it has changed crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has consolidated power like no figure in the kingdom in decades he holds all the key\nLevers and so the best handicapping it there's no one in a position to change if we ran into challenge him a while there are many people in the kingdom who are enjoying criticizing him over this he's made many enemies along the way none of them seems to have enough left\nTo push him out a lot of succession as long as you're dead is okay with it and his dad is elderly and may not be that company right now\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a very brief meeting with the king ah not too long ago and she expected me with NBS when he's there\nAh I'm I'm expecting that he will I don't know the details of his schedule\nSo it is it possible that there is within the guy and this was just a range of possibility or giving them the second option which is your ... responsibility but not\nA guilt the other one as you say someone was trying to take me out the rogue operative was actually working to advance the exiled faction of\nRoyals that I had improved the Ritz Carlton has that been floated anywhere you\nKnow you know and to be honest a cynical as I Am I expected that what they would go with I expected we would hear that there's rogue operative was associated with some old regime\nBut in fact what I'm told we're going to hear is that the rogue operative is someone who actually was a friend of of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman who felt like he had the okay from the crown prince to do this rendition\nAnd who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nThat is the Henry the second is pure Henry the second Thomas back at a parallel will that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the factor in the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday would the Henry the second offends me six a sufficient for the United states well\nA key question here is has turkey shared its intelligence red turkey Turkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe a video of from inside the conflict showing who did what in the excess in Asia you know they've got they've got the goods\nIf they've shared that with their U.S intelligence got it buys who often work very closely with the Turks then that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it that's another that that diminishes the degree\nOf seriousness for the U.S and diminishes the pressure on the U.S to try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nRight now it does it impact for example the war in Yemen and this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stressed this is a Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel and America\nTrying to confront the hook these who are sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcomed a as being a necessary course correction in the middle east\nUh I'm not sure this had any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish this whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting ahead of the Saudis and already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis had begin to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession a inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nAnd therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it as an exotic story and read like a thriller I'm a ... a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long ... Patrick\nYeah I think where they tried to say before where it's going to hit a the crown prince is with elite opinion\nYou know the wall street and Silicon Valley uh he's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and they know how to help diversify the Saudi economy\nHe's going to find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort and that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia over the not too long term has got some real issues in terms of being able to support their economy on their oil revenue\nLast question David Kirkpatrick when\nThe hands of the soldiers goes into a paperback edition or is this going to be the the forward because this is I don't know if it's a turning point or a bump in the road\nYou know to sort of do will have to say\nWell I appreciate your coming to join me David ... Patrick on the New York times author of into the hands of the soldiers which is the definitive you've got to read it to understand what the Arab Spring was about what happened to the Arab Spring where the new on time comes\nFrom and how it is going to endure or not indoor thank you David let me fast is so great to be able to talk to someone actually knows what they're doing on Saudi Arabia is very difficult [noise]\nUm it is not difficult to tell you don't touch my Medicare dot com is where you go to join the a Mac team not fighting against Bernie care in these elections don't touch my Medicare dot com is run by the association of mature American citizens dot U.
