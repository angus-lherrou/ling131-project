love to be on a bow blind today you have a you have work to do you're a busy guy and it goes back to a major league fishing a few years ago I think it was seven years ago you and boy that it had this

vision you know we could ever get it in through those conversations you know we developed a very close friendship but what was I think really intriguing about\nTo both of those is the fact that we had a big decision of the sport and how could anglers being bold decision making how can angers being bold creating\nHum a sport out of committee dangling so then in turn we created major league fishing you know you know we have great partners that are involved and email which is\nNow the outdoor channel which is the lowest gee group um they are very very supportive of what we're doing and of course now here in the\nLast couple of weeks we've actually announced an expansion of major league fish in which is the expansion of the\nMajor league fishing ... camps and now we've increased or anger side

owner of the Texas pistol and rifle academy white right Texas about an hour north of Dallas his military background and decades of experience will put you on the money long range if you'll just listen to and Robert thanks again for hosting me here for ...\nListen it's always a pleasure to have you I've certainly been a big fan of yours for years thanks for coming\nYeah my pleasure thank you for making me a better shooter I really appreciate that I Want to talk about dry fire a little bit and how important a piece of practice that is\nA a lot of people are still under the misconception that if they drive fire their rifle they're going to ruin the firing pan and that brand new pretty rifle or they just pulled out of the box is shot and that's not true\nI think sometimes that mindset gets a little conflicted with a collector type piece of equipment or collective farm a collector farm certainly you don't want to want to drive farm especially from the from the owner standpoint but from an operational standpoint I don't think you can draw far enough\nOr let's say I drive a rifle five thousand and one time on the five thousand and want a time that I drive already came up became a part in a in a hundred pieces while the five thousand good repetitions what far surpass\nOr anything it took to replace the rifle is for shooting prosperity\nThere you go and it's not going to fall apart on your either um you told me I have a really good story about a lady that was very successful in mass shooting competition and she learned it all standing in her kitchen dry firing\nA ... that's a story that we tell here occasionally a and it and it goes as follows some years ago\nThere was a a entity called the ... the ... made whole stairs and I assume maybe they're still in business but some years ago a beyond he had a what they call the steel cup challenge than it was a a competition with polling place there was a plate at five seven and ten yards\nYou drew from the whole show was you're Nineteen eleven\nNineteen loving style a weapon and you engage the plate that at times\nYou engage the plate is seven and ten yards [laughter] anyway this is Gail shows up and she's got a you know street clothes on a you know not like her competitors on the right or left they're all sponsored you know where this this high speed or looking clothing on with the advertising uh every which way\nAnd this girl comes out of nowhere she beats everybody hands down\nSo I was over they were interviewing her\nThe ladies open invitational ... steel challenged they were interviewing her as to her expertise in order to come from the ... because you came out of nowhere street clothes or you know she had a nice looking regarding the pistol Reagan and she did a phenomenal job and uh\nThey ask are funny what what did you learn all this works you get it she said well really you\nKnow like I got it in the kitchen [noise]\nAnd it was a long pause and the commentator are on television or in front of the whole world kinda kinda giggled and ... she said she said I did it in the kitchen she said my husband bought me the whole ... the rig the competition reg\nShe said uh I went down to my local gun range and I got a block of instruction on safety you know and and gun management\nAnd then I took the technique that I used the one two three four parts to engaging the target with a pistol\nAnd she said I went in the kitchen after I got the husband all the work kids to school she said I hung a or a soup can lid on one of the kitchen doors\nI hung a a coffee can lead for the seven for the five coffee can live for the seven\nAnd a pie plate for the ten and she said I Would spend Fifteen minutes a day that ripping the gun out of the holster and engaged the suit can lead to gauge the coffee can land and engage the pie plate or after ten\nAnd she said I did that consistently for the last six months in a here I Am wow\nDr fire works because of muscle memory repetition practice practice practice\nAre absolutely correct and uh you know I have to go back to Peter cap sticks book deaths in the tall grass when he made a comment about the care mojo bell that at the moment care mo Jo bell got ready to break the shot his subconscious mind would make the correction to a perfect shot\nYou know and I read that several times and finally I got totally intrigues with the concept so I went down to Dallas safari club convention and I met a guy named Bob Harper\nAnd I bought a book by Karen mo Jo bell and read all through the book and at the end here's what it said [noise]\nCaramel Joe Bell would never deploy into his daily uh\nAfrica hunting environment that usually without a small caliber rifle because he harvested ducks and food for the for the table at night but what you did was he drives fired a consistently and incessantly through the day and what he did he made sure that they shot was absolutely correct and wind up\nBefore he released the trigger and broke the shot and what\nDid it implanted in his subconscious mind show at the moment Karen mojo bell got ready to break the shot Peter cap stick statement was it the shot was an absolutely correct the subconscious mind made the correction yeah\nSo are you speak a dry far I I Would say maybe they care mo Jo bill but certainly rings a bell on that concept\nYeah I'll tell you what it's a very important part of what you teach here in fact ah when when folks come in that first day that they're going to spend some classroom time with you they're going to be asked to\nUh once they learn your method tenure steps which are also very important in all makes sense you have a great way of teaching or I can understand\nA layman's terms what you were talking about what you were doing and uh\nAnd then they're going to be asked to dry fire right there in the classroom or until they got that down right until they know what they're doing until they have enough repetition to move to the range and then when you move to a live fire out on the range\nUh every time that we moved to new target you would have made Dr fire several times before live fire to carry that over and blended in to get a great program\nThat um that uh the dry forests kind of like looking at yourself in the mirror\nOr looking at your shooting in the mirror to make sure your gig on his right you've got nothing\nUh you know hanging out of place so once you look at your shooting a and your released the trigger you break the shot in the dry far method that should be no disturbance of the cross air against the target so so that Dr far is a very critical part of the of the shooting scenario that we teach\nI'm sure you have folks bring their first rifles or pistol out here to you and you have folks that like may have been shooting for decades or come out to you like those first timers that have never fired around in their half scared to death I don't know what they're doing a ... do you like them because I don't have any bad habits [laughter]\nWell ah you know uh we like everybody that comes to the front door that that makes a decision you know to to to spend some of their hard money with us ah and and they and they had decided I Want to I Want to gain a block of instruction\nBut uh you know some of the new or shooters but a lot of time show up with good equipment okay versus some of the older folks that come into the older rifles that they weren't just shoot very well and sometimes that I'm\nA that equipment on on some of the old or a guns is not a shooter friendly as uh some some of the newer shooters and that\nThat might be the only comment I might make knocked it that are older cat learn how to do that all of a shame to make the shot but but sometimes that's what comes to mind right now in regards to that question\nYeah understand a new let's take another little break and then we're going to come back and talk I hate math I've hated math my whole life and that's one reason why I've never studied in a and\nAnd uh wind de Janeiro elevation and I am not ever trusted myself that I'm confident as I can be now let's take another it'll break we'll come back talk about it that sounds great belly\nTime for a leg stretch or maybe a\nQuick visit to your laptop to take a look at Texas just all that time take a look at Roberts program ranges et cetera\nGood morning everybody is voting Pickens big ... will be right back in ... gone very low pay ballet and I\nThan nine twenty the answer had the opportunity to sit down and talk with candidate for governor Brian Kemp\nMinolta unsolved with some of the other day and they were\nWere upset because somebody they knew that they said was a good person that was here illegally and they got arrested in the guys are going to get the word I hate it for the
