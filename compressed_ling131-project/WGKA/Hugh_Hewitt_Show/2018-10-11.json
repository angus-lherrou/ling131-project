Chris mark how skied a watchdog on Wall street Hey Chris\nMorning I've got uh some news to report here this is coming from our affiliates\nThey're in Valdosta, Georgia oh Scott James had Ninety two point one and he also runs the station one all seven point five or in Jasper, Florida he's telling me kept in Valdosta fared pretty well I have a bunch of ... and debris to clean up when I return to the house and power went out four times\nThe longest time was thirty minutes my slow roll into the station this morning saw plenty of debris and half the intersections are without power\nSo is the tower site us or we're down I Will spend the morning trying to get everything back to normal God was looking out for us for sure and I'm Glad to hear Scott did you did well because of Valdosta last night in Cornell they had some really really really\nA bad weather and there was Ninety plus mile an hour winds everyone right up by Seventy five last night\nWe hit number you get up there especially anything that's not tied down I'm as flying around and it's going to cause a big mess but uh\nYou know the uh the poor people are in Panama City that they're going to be taken out from that for a while a lot of structural a devastation there as well I mean when you're seeing a box cars that are flipped over do to win you know that when there's something ferocious\nWell it took to school gymnasium I don't know if you saw it right there in Panama City and\nActually tore a whole from one side to the other side darn near picked up the roof off the building I guess there was too much steel couldn't do it but it's certainly took one mall all took another wall out and suck everything was in it out a in a in a school gymnasium in Panama City\nYeah as far as intensity is concerned I you know especially the wind damage I I I mean we've we've got storms\nI'm a late hit the the country and it's been mostly water damage that we've seen read on the flooding in the rain that that is that it you know Hurricane Florence adjust to it was you know 'cause it slow moving and it was so much water coming down a but the the the actual wind devastation from this is uh something else really seen anything like that\nNow there's just two miles shy of a category five as tough as they come as high as they come and go to one Seventy three\nSomething else I well ah what happened to the stock market [noise] I'll look down yesterday I saw that but why why\nDon't you can't always that that's the problem is people always try to look for a reason why um\nYeah it's like they're forced to run across the country and he steps that are filed dog poop and what was the whole thing is you know what happens sometimes that's the reality it's you know sometimes you can be in a a great big old market\nAnd there can be a major sell off and there's no rhyme or reason to it I mean some think it might have something to do\nWith the fed raising rates as possible um I think it has more to do with the fact that I think a lot of tech stocks are highly overvalued I think that plays a part in it as well\nWith the higher interest rates were also Shia dampening of the housing market in you've got mortgage rates are over five percent or so when you see stuff like this you know sometimes the markets cells often takes time to adjust\nTo what's going on and what the the actual you know train is at that point in time here on the ground so what do I think that they'll probably a continuation of the market will continue to sell off because it has overseas short short but I'm not I'm not concerned about it I mean it is what it is markets do they go but I use it as an October\nNow let me mention something here about two weeks ago the price of gasoline at the pump wears down to two fifty nine um and it went boom the very next day to Seventy nine no warning no nothing and some Cochran made me she was given well yesterday\nOn oil price dot net we find out that there's a lot of oil they got more oil did you know what to do it so guess what now the prices back down almost to where it was two weeks ago and the excuse is being given while there's a lot of oil and and the prices drop because of it really you don't mean to tell me it was that way all the time\n[noise] yeah but again it's it's it's that's the nobody sets the price it's a market that does it so if someone decides you know pay the price up they're going to pay the price up a you know someone decides to walk away from it and make prices go down and you know obviously this factors that are called no Iranian oil is not on the market\nRight now a Donald Trump put pressure on the Saudis to pump more out as well to to get the price down\nA way to get the more independent we become the better off being restricted tend to get you know or strike to get more oil out of the ground part that the fluctuation but especially you know considering that you set a hurricane barrel to the Gulf of Mexico or your prices really didn't pop that much um you know you know years ago that would drive the prices to the roof\nYeah went up two dollars a barrel and then it dropped two dollars and fifty cents a barrel the next day I got it oh yeah\nYeah they do that either the uh the offshore rigs\nNo no I got it and now I've got a question for you um do we need ... to go back again\n[noise] I've been pushing for that sense they repealed it back and not and I tend to thousands I Know you have that right yeah I yeah I Would love to see them break up the big banks but I I don't\nI think anti trust legislation that go further I think they have to start moving into the tech sector I think they start looking at Google Facebook many of these companies that controls so much of the online conversation stories coming out but as of late and some of these things are whistle blower type stuff\nWhat's going on behind the scenes and some of these companies is it's frightening you know when they broke up ma bell um we had extraordinary innovation for decades I mean you will ruin an adult that the cell phones are on the Internet and all these various ensuring less they did that\nIt brings more competition into an industry and the reality is I think the breakup value of these companies is actually much higher than they're worth right now so\nYeah do I think we could bring back Glass Steagall but I also think that we need that antitrust regulators taking a look at a lot of these\nTech stocks [noise] okay very good uh what are you going to be talking about today\nThat we started talking about the markets that's for sure\nOkay well we're going to let you go because you got airtime come up in about ten minutes over there and you're just on my sister station your flagship stations are teenagers so you have yourself a good day\nTo buy our\nChris my couch watchdog on Wall street catch him over there on his network ... stations are teenagers and biz and I'm always a a good program for sure now\nAgain a\nAnd Scott I'm Glad you told me that because we were concerned everybody was concerned about what happened because um I Know that um I was watching the reports coming from Cornell Georgia or last night and of course I'm\nA Ninety plus mile an hour winds the guy standing there hardly able to stand up and I was thinking to myself you told me where you are going to be and I went oh boy here we go so a\nPower is going to be a problem yeah for sure but we've got a in Florida they've got a Nineteen\nThousand a first responders which include not only power but the telephone and a cable\nBalls\nOr I can and on the relief that uncommon studio inside the beltway hurricane Michael has leveled Panama City in vale Airforce base took the brunt of it the great news is if there weren't any people at ten day I'll\nForget the machines that got the military families out there they got the F twenty to all of our strike fighters off of there but it's been leveled\nThat I'm worried about\nA thousands of military families have lost everything and uh people in Panama City I've lost\nEverything that the the video Panama City is like a homestead Florida after Andrew ... obviously ... Khan will be on the ground and they are definitely going to rally to their air force brothers and sisters that tend to el and their families but we'll figure out a way\nTo let you know about that and we're bringing up to speed up pictures are just studying\nThe major news the market shuttered yesterday went down ... points we'll check the early market report later in the day look at your correction going to happen it's not a panic the economy has three point seven percent unemployment and cook it at Fort Point two percent people took some money out of the market it'll bounce back no worries there\nBut I Do worry about American politics\nEric Holder who's running for president President Obama's attorney general was caught on a cell phone video cameras small gathering got number eight\nUsed the powers that they have gotten for all the wrong things they want to keep themselves in ... they want to cheat or to the special interests is time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are to be dedicated as they are to be as committed is Michele always ask them all over you know\nMy wife like really tight which will scare me and she always says that you don't when they go low we\nKnow they go low we [noise]\nAfter Hillary Clinton said we can't be civil and it is becoming the mob mob they're out there but they left hates it when you bring up the marks a Don Lemon ... Lewis got into it famously now on CNN about what a mob is I Want to play that cut them or to\nGo out before you answer and keep that what's your kick that fashion but your party won right they have the White House to go to Congress have to have big justice is in the last year people who don't agree with it or exercising one of their options which is protest is calling them of mob is that a bit much\nI I\nI don't know I I I Know you've got to be okay with that word or\nPhrase up okay I've got to get to the break we'll answer your question the U.S or is it my behavior no it's not moderated by people who are angry with the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy that they were doing before you jump into okay I'm making a point\nI Can't make it if you keep interrupting me up but you know you're you're making a point are you the moderator or the host or are you arguing that liberal moderator and the host\nOf the show you that you're giving up until it\nAll I think that I'm like look up the word mob and the dictionary definition\nYou're up the word modern the dictionary and you should also as a Republican look at the ... I'm ... and look at the ... or whatever it is you are whatever it is you are look at the constitution of the United states and it gives people the right to protest\nIt doesn't say where you can join the easel will you please\nLet us OK okay if I have a drink so you can do whatever you want and you could lead to show up you want but let me finish I'm not going okay well then shut up and let me do it All right thank you very much\nIn the constitution you can protest\nWhenever and wherever you want it doesn't tell you that you can't do it at a restaurant it doesn't tell you that you can do it all the football field doesn't tell you that you can do it on a cable news show you can do it wherever you want them to call people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right it's just beyond the pale will\nThat is by the way incorrect\nDon Lemon was one hundred percent wrong I've been teaching constitutional law for twenty two years time place and manner of restrictions are embedded in the first amendment you cannot do it wherever you want whenever you want that was mob rule breaking through barriers\nIs mob rule it the definition of mob rule it is a mob on the left right now and we are dealing with the mob meanwhile CNN doesn't seem to want to deal with mobs\nBrooke Baldwin hat on Mary Catherine Hammond they're adoptable Matt Louis ... number one\nThe line and and Mary Catherine I lego and to have more poll data and just no doubt on it's a little bit because obviously yes Republicans got a huge when Kavanaugh but we've seen poll numbers today shelling this little syringe and gender gap for Republican Party in that same poll says sixty three percent of women\nSay they will be voting for Democrats so Republicans have a woman problem is not new that just seems uh gotten worse how do they fix it by November sex\nYeah I mean I think this is the most potent potential problem that Trump has brought to the mid term that tension on them that's not my friend I look I think he has taken a group of maybe swing flash slightly right leaning white college educated ex urban women and mom\nAnd shipping them to more fully swing voters or even folks who will lean left\nOr in the future and that is a problem particularly in these vulnerable how the\nI Will say also though does this cannot buy I think people are potentially underestimating how\nMuch it did energize Republicans on the other side including Republican women um and the issue for Democrats I think that their enthusiasm was already here\nIt was already way up here and art and the Republican Party is out is to bring parity and so I think they actually do have a chance to gain a bet and it will matter more in Senate races than it does in these vulnerable house races where those women really matter the switching less share\nAnd and care pointed out energizing at Republicans and then your thing Republican women that you think that that really ... the Republican strategy ... strategy of a weapon rising right having all you know they just do this for the next four weeks do you think that that's a winning strategy\nI definitely think it's a winning strategy for the midterms there could be long term consequences that we look back at this moment that this was you know one moment on our way to Republicans having a demographic problem but in terms in the mid term dieting Mary Catherine exactly right\nDemocrats are already motivated Donald Trump like nothing that happened uh you know last week is going to matter who the person who's already upset about all the other thing Donald Trump has done Democrats were motivated passionate angry survey are either going to turn out or they're not\nRepublicans there the theme that needed the the excitement the past and the energy they didn't have it\nIn mid term that's what matters for turnout and now I think they do and it's because I Believe it's the overreacting lap when you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out of restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word totally a mop it is without a\nDoubt that we're now\nIt's a little put a stop to it on a mob\nIs what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they got no I think that what we saw\nSame thing I don't think we've right\nWhat about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the walls all that\nCivil protest or without a mob I think it's easily a mob\nYeah and if there weren't any party or as we call it a mob ... come on but the the area now let me let me let me move past the N. word because I Do feel like that as part of the the weaponization of of what's happening now on the right but at the same time I think you do make a really interesting point and a piece I write American gay that\nWhile this whole issue with tapping on Fort has been incredibly dismissive in this country it has been unifying among Republicans like Republicans had a Republican problem and you had the Trump or isn't the never Trump or in your whole point is that this is what\nCauses Republican to be one big one by the family again\n[noise] yeah look I think that that\nThe Brett Kavanaugh okay now\nThere are never Trump or prominent never cropper who aren't and journalists and intellectuals that this was very ... uh the cabin all case really split the never Trump movement and you had about half of them the era era ends of the world\nWho were basically they hated Donald Trump but now they feel pushed into Donald Trump's camp I think it's a backlash against the law um and then you and other people like the ... groups of the world the dinner for ribbons of the world that were pushed the other way but in terms of the rank and file average Republican voter\nA lot of people out there around the country they don't really like Donald Trump but they saw Brett Kavanaugh as just a regular kind of conservative ... Bush or Marco Rubio with a picker George W. Bush\nAnd so the attack on him which did have you with totally bogus as an attack on them so this really had a unifying effect a lot of people who don't like Donald Trump\nDoes energy on the side of

ever rally\nAnd paid people were going into those rallies causing trouble and in many cases it didn't work out so well for those people may know Jetta pay people were in those rallies but when I hear oh they're making a statement he made today I think it's a disgrace\nAn air raid I really understand she just doesn't get it she never did she never will and that's why she lost the election\nBut I think we all hope that we can get back to some form of stability where we can have this agreement out in the top subjects and respect each other in the process and I hope\nSo too I Do I Hope so too I Hope we're going to be able to do that\nAbout whether there is not a lot of hope here when Eric Holder telling people to kick people in Hillary Clinton saying don't be civil Lindsey Graham on Fox News

you think believe it was okay but Democrat if he thought it was despicable boat for us\nThat is that's it I Do not believe you should vote for one Democrat at any level\nBecause of their attack on Brett Kavanaugh not one at any level of course not for Senate\nI think Matt Rosendale in Montana deserves your vote over the incumbent Jon Tester opposed cabinet participated in the slimy\nI think we

important for understanding what is going on in American politics today militant normalcy is shot a best seller list everywhere and everybody loves Kurt but I Want to begin with your army hat on your return now current uh ten Dale that means a lot army family I airport families lost everything yesterday\nYeah it does a hue and look I did disaster relief for a long time with a cap Army National guard I was a hell of a earthquake in Ninety four the LA Riots I commanded forces in northern San Diego in the San Diego fire crisis of two thousand seven\nSo you know I I I've been in the middle of these but nothing nothing like this this is going to be incredible and the the devastation or military families are military equipment\nUh and and of course the the people on the Florida coast it is it's going to be credible and we're going to see a huge effort or a huge collection of a military and civilian effort going into a relieve him I think I think this is one of the things that Donald Trump has done very well Hugh\nWhich is a focus on these disasters course sky help Rick Scott too because it shows confidence I mean would you would you want to trust ... with us are kind of recovery ... it's a real test of seriousness for the people for it\nRight right and and I think seriousness is on the ballot in fact after Eric Holder yesterday to talk to you about Eric I got a plan for people so that if they are just tuning in this was the former attorney general now presidential candidate Eric Holder caught on a cell phone video at a small gathering ... number eight they have\nTo use the power that may have gotten corps ball the wrong things they want to keep themselves in how they want to teeter to special interests get is time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are to be dedicated as they are to be committed to sail Michele always is all over you\nKnow my wife went really tight which will scare me [laughter] it was selling says and you know when they go low we don't know [laughter] they go low we can\nEncourage lake there went through military normal ... think about that\nWell look militant normal are saying yeah I I Know you know I guess I guess when we go low you run guns to Mexico and get held in contempt of Congress you or a sick the IRS on us it looks like they sick the uh uh FBI on our leaders\nOf the folks we elected I mean ... really Hugh how how do these guys how are these guys start playing hardball did they resurrect stop from nursery school I mean we're already at ... with that Stephen Miller article about eating aced as a kid I mean we're already at third grade I mean how deep do we go\nIt's triggered some CNN anchors like Don Lemon you're not allowed to use the word mob around them are they going to melt down you Don limited mix it up before but I get to a more profound thing right now the media is trying to say how long will the cabinet backlash yesterday I saw Chuck Schumer come out with a bunch of Democrats they didn't mention Kevin I'll watch that tells me\nThat Martha McSally surged a Marsha Blackburn surge Matt Rosendale surge the surge of Mike brought that it's very deep and wide\nWell what it is it's so bad for the Democrats the Dino Rossi is starting to win something in Washington yep how bad it is\nThey do everything to make sure dino loses yeah that's that's like a certain number one thing check ... dino out of a win but I think it goes to this militant normal phenomenon that you've been talking about and and explain for people who live in a cave what a militant normal it's\nOK normal people works you know she were or are the kind of people who don't spend all their talking about politics they're too busy building this country feeding it fueling it even defending it\nUh their regular folks who who trusts the elite to go you know run our country runner institutions I Want security and prosperity as long as you do that you know you take a little off the top of your power you're procedure money\nThat's fine I Want to live my life I Want to do things like teach by kids basketball team go to church even enjoy the occasional beer\nBob but when they screw up you know the normal come back and react the silent majority throwing out Jimmy Carter\nThe problem now Hugh is not only are leads incompetent refusing to accept any kind of accountability they actually hate normal people and you you can see that I mean you get Hillary Clinton\nInterview the other day saying well you know there can't be any civility I I mean until we're in charge of the civility of the great pass\nIt it is and I I Do believe that when they asked the question how long will it last their tempting do message Democrats not to talk about this\nI don't think you forget getting mugged a month later I really don't think you put the mugging behind you are getting hit by a car or watching someone get murdered ... not over in a month and a and I don't think the militant normal are going to forget cabinet and Chuck Grassley\nA funny belly you might be said yesterday remember cabinet that is the militant normal rallying cry\nWell look is is the uh you know as the hip kids say the militant normal Scott whoa by Kavanaugh we're kind of OK things are going good we're\nWe're just going to go back to our lives and then they realized what complete lunatics the people on the other side we're in and and frankly evil lunatics I mean you don't do what they did the Kavanaugh to any way that that\nIs unacceptable every every normal man out there thought\nWait a minute this is a license to destroy anybody pops his head up and opposes the elite this you know in every uh every woman had to think when I got a husband and I got a brother I got a son he can be destroyed in an instant\nBy these people if we let them do they ...\nIt was a cookbook and if it had worked there you know I I joke to some of us that there will never be another white male Supreme Court justice but that is probably not true because it didn't work but all of a sudden if we've got Stephen Miller third grade picture\nPosted then we know the extent and depth to which they will go and I this is not political it isn't the way we do things church like there\nWill look like I'm ready to militant normal we've really got two choices we can accept this and say okay you're beaten us I Am I'm taking this whole infatuation with participating in my own self governance off the table you can do what you want or you can say no\nNo I'm not going to do I'm going to vote for the dino Ross is I have over ... ... in the hallways\nAnd the blogs and and the ...

I mean maybe there was an arms race we weren't even part of it that your choice where do you want to go first about either of these incredibly important stories\nAll we can do either one of just arbitrarily pick a shaggy\nFur I go ahead what do we what what are the stakes and what are we to be demanding and doing\n[noise] [noise] well the stakes are huge and I think you know where I went through with this you was the context okay and the context is that Trump has done a pretty good job at this point of rebuilding the paradigm\nThe the set of partnerships that we've always used I mean since Camp David accords and the Iranian Revolution that Seventy nine that we use to protect our interests and that is a partnership with Egypt Jordan Israel\nSeveral of the Gulf states and often on Saudi Arabia so Ah yes we need to put pressure on the Saudis to make very clear that we don't like this but this is one of these instances where we got to remember you know we're the friend that liberty everywhere but the custodian only of our own\nAnd we have to tend to America's interests and I tell my friends who and I share this you know who who want human rights to be an object of our policy I Believe in that but I'm the I'm the ... the prospering of human rights around the world that hands on the continued security\nAnd vitality of of the United states so yes we have to pressure them but I think we also have to understand that right now we're working with them and a lot of areas\nDo you think that the market collapse as some concern over this down down eight hundred and thirty one point yesterday it's often other two hundred and twenty in the free market there there are some worry that there's a rupture a foot\nWell potentially although if you're going to ask about the market either good Kudlow or somebody like me I you know I don't know we'll see if this continues I'm actually I'm I mean I always do these things as kind of a correction until something you know something emerges show different\nAll right let's move over to the fact of the Bloomberg report that the Chinese have been weaponized seeing the commercials say a commercial\nProduct stuff that everybody buys they had been weaponized saying that would be an arms race in which we were not participants 'cause we don't do that yeah and they\nDo this and first of all there's almost no civil military divide in China all the companies all the efforts are are directed towards the end state or\nThey're producing a lot of the components that are used in information technology communications infrastructure around the world and there's been a concern for a long time about what they may be planting those components and this is going to get\nThis is going to get bigger as five gee comes along and and and the number of those of those devices and the importance of them to every aspect of white multiplies geometric one it's a real challenge and I'm I'm ... glad the administration is focused so much in this national competition is long overdue\nWho has the lead on this\nIt's an interagency thing new and that's part of the problem is\nThat's not good yeah\nWell I understand but we're not organized I mean Trump is Trump's people had to do a lot of things at once one of them is to consider how we organize as a government to deal with this you know it's like\nTrying like when we built the architecture of the Cold War national security policies and took a decade right so we got to do it quicker than that I Would say that the commerce trade representative DOD has a lot to say about it because of course they have a lot of these devices it's homeland\nUm it's a whole lot of\nDifferent agencies and organizations involved\nNow a center of town in terms of of sanctions against China do we concerning ourselves with for example the fact that they are relocating eight million wires into concentration camps is that our business\nWell it's a it's a\nGood pressure point it's a yes it is our business because uh on one level of United States speaks for human rights around the world\nUm and and we should do it by the way with regard it as howdy I'm guessing that we are seeing them I mean what we need to call 'em out on it we just have to be censored the broader context here I think it's a tremendously good pressure point again\nAnd not just the ... what they're doing in Hong Kong\nOr what they're doing generally just social credit system they're developing the minute control the lives of their people yeah they're sensitive to that and we should use it as a pressure point that's one area I've not seen a lot out of the Trump Administration yet although the vice president's speech the other day and kudos to you for that interview\nA was a really good opening wedge in there\n[laughter] I Hope it keeps it up Jim Talent always a pleasure by the way Claire McCaskill just wrote up the Boot Hill of of Missouri what kind of politics is that\nUh I don't think it's very good but I don't think the trend line the last couple of weeks and very good for Senator McCaskill\nGory America what was your eyes Canada to literally factor dot com studios inside

they'll air force base is almost dead after Andrew is that what your ear and\nYeah yeah and you know you've got to remember this part of the state you know it's interesting\nIt just doesn't get hit with with the mild hurricane the that this is for some reason the way that they turned they either make a you know go slightly south of that area and will you know across the state essentially just north of the act or\nA interstate or they fear a little farther to the west it where I have family in Pensacola I mean this was so odd perhaps a pan handle it and it's a cola basically all I got to understand um it's so this part of Florida see it's it's a double whammy here it's the most you know one of the most powerful storms in the history of the state\nIn an area that hasn't been hit very often so it just adds to the devastation because you haven't had the clearing\nOut of trees with smaller storms in the same way you do in other parts of the state so just doubled the impact and then this thing was just the only good news is that it moves fast\nThat's the only good in that I remember after a homestead the Indians were going to move spring training ... that was gone that air force base a gun I Wonder if ... done what I'm hearing is true luckily they got all the people out but there are thousands of military families and and the left\nAnd here's here's the thing you and I both know we the the ... the Pentagon think there are too many base within the country but there's no political will to close them but if any\nThe ... don't work they get close to what happened to that you look I remember a homestead was going to be our new airport you know that was that was another idea to try to you know instead of trying to ... you know\nTry to expand Miami international airport which is some argue too close to downtown as it is right for flight paths and things like that and and you know what it just didn't happen unfortunately home states to to to sort of not\nWasn't was which is too far south for the rest of the population and that's my fear of what's going to happen to Kendall ended up my fear of what's going to happen with the beach communities will rebuild\nUm
