his name have been floated stand out in that crowd I think being a task here think scientists are saying all paid any on the national things\nNow Chris there's one other thing to add to this and that's the fact that Taylor Swift got in and rendered her opinion remember about Marsha Blackburn and the U.S senators race in a tendency\nYes at the time Marsha Blackburn was down to the Democratic opponent when she opened her mouth that's now turned around or marches open up an eight point lead\n[noise] yeah they're they're they're trying to figure out ways alludes almost to some degree I mean the the Elizabeth Warren thing right now which again it it is beyond um I mean they're they're coming up with new ways on a regular basis at my car I just how absolutely ridiculous just in the video\nIs crazy it's crazy and it\nMakes a making up stories saying their parents are low because they thought that you know her\nHer mother was a Native American and that wasn't a a you couldn't do that back and that they give me a break I\nI think you're more she's more area than Hitler for crying out loud I ... the average white yeah average European white guy in this country has got or Native American blood than she does I mean it is so well\nLet me let me tell you about my own case then I'll just throw this out there because it's true I I was made a blood brother the underdog Indian reservation remember those guys down there and cargo K. while I was made a blood brother would my my good friend John buck who he and I I used to watch him and being in amazement watching him play ... ... across you know all of that is right\nUh yeah and on the ... nation you don't they don't mess around at all\nNo no no that's right and he became a marine at the same time I went in the army so we were good friends we went to school together and we became blood brothers you know how you cut the island you to Seattle we did that so just let me see does that make me part Indian even though I'm an honorary member of the tribe I don't think so and\nI said that you know ... everybody plays lacrosse more India [laughter]\nWell I tried it but I I got knocked I got I got you know those walls were only about what maybe four or five foot tall and the box I got knocked over the top of one of those laws by one of those uh those I knew that and that was the end of it for me I said nope I don't think so\nYeah that's a tough game the indoor box stuff on the reservations without a doubt but yeah I mean these are finding new ways to make a fool out of herself she really is\nYeah so so there you go but uh I mean it's just absolutely ludicrous so they kind of stuff and of course the other thing that's going on is and I'm sure you'll be talking about this one today uh Israel just struck twenty targets said this morning\nOf within the last hour in Hamas uh where they'd been firing missiles from them and of course India tells them hey cut it out or else or India Israel tells them hey cut it out or else and then they go in and they take out whatever the structure is or was there I mean they leveled a bunch of places\nWhere I'm getting a couple of news stories when they're talking about what was hit 'em up and I haven't gotten anything really to spin a specific yet well we'll find out but yeah they don't they don't oh back when it comes to a a very different spots where missiles that could come and make it a citizen\n[noise] so one last little thing here\nYou think the uh and we got about a minute to do this do you think the Republicans are going to keep control of the house in the Senate this time around that kind of looks like it to me\nIt was a good shot I mean right now that it most certainly Republicans are energized and Democrats ... all over them for whatever reason it may be but I thought that there might be some sort of Robert Mueller thing he says he's wrapping up the investigation but it's not going to be released so after the midterms\nYeah while I'm not surprised or you\nKnow I I think if you had something on the Trump or whatever it may be some sort of a a poll or whatever he was trying to do I think you would do it before the midterms yell at a ... they're just saying the laughter\nI agree OK well Chris we'll let you go will catch you over there on Thirteen eighty to ... and about ten minutes you got to have a great\nThank you very much and of

we've ever seen it's it was devastating I was home with with Heidi and my girls during the hurricane and and for months thereafter spent time in virtually every community along the Gulf Coast two three four five times working with the state and local officials\nI mentioned earlier a hundred and Seventy one sheriff's have endorsed my campaign including\nTen Democrats one of the reasons why the overwhelming majority elected sheriffs endorse my campaign is because many of those shares I've worked with hand in hand\nAfter Harvey and the Senate I helped lead the effort to pass three major disaster relief bills\nWorking hand in hand with John Cornyn where we improved and expanded those disaster relief fails and the emergency tax relief that you just referenced was legislation that I authored\nI'll introduce passed into law did it jointly with John Cornyn Marco Rubio\nThe cruise Cornyn Rubio emergency tax relief gave over five billion dollars in emergency tax relief for families impacted by Hurricane Harvey it passed both houses of Congress overwhelmingly was signed into law provided immediate relief for those impacted by Harvey\nOnly for Texas Democrats voted no on that legislation\nOne of them was congressman O'Rourke congressman from El Paso and that was the reason for that you know he gave an answer now he said that it didn't provide enough tax relief\nThat's not what he said at the time he voted that with the tiny though to now he said the reason he voted now is that he wanted he he wanted to focus on legal immigration has hit again that was his answer at the time\nSo I thank you representative you get the second story bottled here we're glad that vote\nI don't I Will always see what I can do work with anyone anytime anywhere to do better for Texas no that was what I was trying to do but\nYou know Senator Cruz mentioned listening to and working with local leaders in Houston I'm I've listened to and work with the mayor and the county judge a Democrat and Republican each of whom is still waiting\nFor one point one billion dollars awarded to the local governments in community development block grant funding this still not made its way into the neighborhoods into the streets into the homes and businesses to rebuild they need a fulltime center not somebody running for president is going to focus on their needs and make sure that that money gets there may need a fulltime center who had been out\nFor them before the storm on infrastructure projects that they had identified needed funding but they needed a senator who's going to work for them\nArmy Corps of engineers approved projects totaling in the hundreds of millions of dollars who did not have an advocate because he wasn't in Texas was in Houston He was in Iowa\nNew Hampshire is wanting for another office instead of taking care of the concerns and the names of the people who\nNow a Donald Trump just tweeted about pets\n[noise] I\nWatched the debate last night and day or two wants higher taxes and far more regulations is not in the same league with Ted Cruz and what the great people of Texas than foreign want petted strong on crime border and Second Amendment loves our military vets low taxes paid\nAs a flake interesting like his capital laugh but I don't know if there's a double entendre there are there not to President Trump here's some more Ted Cruz your last night\nBut you know it's striking that the congressman O'Rourke didn't dispute his extreme record on abortion supporting late term abortions hoarding taxpayer funding for abortion supporting taxpayer funding for abortions late term even for illegal aliens that\nThey'll aliens valid state issued taxpayer funded driving certificates and they never getting grains of rice fun and spent that money on um\nOn on the general fund and these are all things that they if they all say he's are paying attention to the fact that when he was governor he had two different tracks for handling sexual harassment\nAllegations and claimed if your friend the tail noticed matters were handled privately in the documents restricted and others went through the regular state process\nSo people don't a light you can get those things they're remembering that\nThey know that if he were to go to the U.S Senate that he would be his boss would be Chuck Schumer\nAnd that he had to have friends named Dianne Feinstein a Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Cory Booker Kamala Harris intended the un's would never go to the polls and vote for the individual that they know about the film Bredesen\nIs they they are they individual\nTo be clear Marsha Blackburn you would have voted to confirm justice cabin on you would have voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch\nCertainly like and I had no problem making up my mind about\nThat because Tennessee and not one activist judges they want good construction is constitutional or set up by by the U.S constitution and the little walk now my pen at\nA ... day to make is lined up on friday the Jew and after the vote is can he said well what if I did yeah and then of course the very last video came out and shows and that that was probably not a trace of statements and he said that for political\nUh read them and that was very revealing staff has saying that\nI Do see some signs of desperation and Phil Bredesen or a\nCongresswoman Blackburn he's now offered to meet with President Trump\nIn other words is going down for the third time and he's got a hand above the water saying hey anybody pay attention to me I don't think President Trump's going to be invited into the rose garden anytime soon President Trump's with you and Mitch McConnell's with you and I guess it comes down to I always have faith\nIn the average voter understanding that the control the Senate go through ever has fifty one votes right\nThat's right and\nTennessee and now that if that were there it is that the Democrats and um he is trying to as you said this is a sign of desperation and he says I'll go meet with the president and our you know he puts his finger in when the white walling and says yes that would have voted for Kavanaugh\nSuch a trace it that if he were in charge is his friends Hillary Clinton did he get thirty three thousand four hundred dollars given one they turn to the president if she will try to didn't he have somebody like a justice cabinet dined Feinstein\nChairman of the Judiciary Committee you would not have somebody like a justice Kavanaugh last fall because they would not allow it and that's what makes it as they seem to think safe for him to say one thing when they're campaigning into another thing to say\nNow was pressuring congresswoman Blackburn and by the way but Marcia is her Twitter handle vote Marcia you can follow her on Twitter you can go to Russia black ... percent of what is the website a congresswoman\nMarsha Blackburn like a commercial block it out there to I can watch what\nThey can contribute because right

I don't believe so I think it's done\nWell look I mean you know when I say that something done we can find examples where there's still some hold over but I really feel like that\nWas it tell right so like if you're in never Trump or and you know the added against confirming justice Kavanaugh it probably means that you will now a Democrat probably you know you have you know across the river con\nAnd simultaneously I mean there are a lot of people that were never Trump or is it hated Donald Trump and now because of cabinet all\nAre basically coming back home so look as anything ever really over probably not but I think that was a turning point in fact it was the end of never Trump ism with in the conservative with in the Republican Party\nYou know I did argue with um a good friend is a never Trump or instill whenever Trump or they're down to about sex that\nThis was before Justice Kennedy's retirement Matt Lewis I argued that if a if Justice Kennedy retired and they know their Gorsuch like judge were confirmed that would be dispositive\nOf the wisdom of having voted for Donald Trump and ... and then I'm just kind of stunned by that because of course accident counterfactual that\nJustice Kennedy wouldn't have retired to Supreme\nCourt picks by Hillary Clinton would've launched the cord into an era of war and like activism that would have made more than like activism seem like ... like conservatism wasn't that the defining moment for twenty sixteen in retrospect\nWell look I mean I think it's possible that that Hillary would not have gotten her nominee that Mitch McConnell would have controlled the Senate and would have deprive her of replacing them so it's not really accurate to say\nAt this point she would have gotten into 'em but look I think I probably would have been Shapiro on this one which is to say the the people who held their nose and voted for Trump", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "17"}
