{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "I was blown away as these people were telling stories about persecution I I just want to hear more and more and they're like why are you still wouldn't treat I go because this is not the way churches where I come from you know like we actually go to a building that we call church\nAnd you know we listen to a message and everything's some songs and we'd go home and and if we like the church down the street and you pass through speaks better and we'll switch you know or the child care over there was a little bit better\nAnd and they just started laughing because and I wasn't trying to be funny like when I left my daughter's like that that was weird they were laughing hysterically and you weren't trying to be funny I go I Know\nIsn't that crazy that they they they found with what we did as a laugh but bowl um because they go how how could you read this book and come up with that the more I just sat with\nThem and thought about it from their perspective the more I thought\nYou know I think they're right there are some things we do that we just started going down certain paths and I didn't really think it through and uh I could see why they would look at scripture and see a a a departure from scripture and our methodology\nPrincess hunger we looked at church in America do we look at it through sacred ice in the hearts I mean many people listening right now they think church well that's one hour a week\nHas a so sad to me I mean we say like we're part of a church body like the reader the unions came in and out crisis your members of my body\nLike the fact that the literal like like you know races and cherishes us because we're a member of his body you can do you guys was I mean do you understand what a miracle that like me human being dependent upon God for life\nThat Christ with the crap can is actually sent me the holy\nMoly only God who was on hold your will light rogue everything into existence says I can be a part of his body\nLike that is the greatest mused on earth that I could be attached to him that's what it means to be a part of the body of Christ\nAnd so so the idea of how we live with one another\nShould expresses amazing miracle to be joined with Christ is the cornerstone the apostles the profit the foundation me being this block in that temple that a living stone all creating one temple for God's will and that is so powerful\nAnd so when we reduce it to watch her to go to move [laughter] no order we done or done with this amazing\nLike breathtaking mystery heavily reduced it to go into a service have people like myself lost the understanding of just how sacred this is\n... ... ... ... it's we live in a culture where everything is self centered notice we're so busy we're so distracted it's almost like when you talk about the sacredness of being a part of the church it's like we don't have time to have reference or even have a relationship or an experience of God\n[noise] yeah I mean it just seems like it's a place we rushed to barely get there on time always show up late rather than this group of people that we cannot wait

civilization that they now seems long gone sadly you're not likely to find a Bible in school today but focused on the family started\nBringing your Bible to school day and kids responded candy Cushman focused on the family explains what happened next on AM eleven sixty hopefully your life in Chicago with mark el strand how did this idea germinate then come to life well\nAbout four years ago I was getting a lot of feedback from students and parents because uh the education and with your focus the ideal ... with a lot of these issues and we listened to our constituents about what's bothering them and we were getting a lot of feedback that students were being pulled things like\nIs that your Bible at school you need to put that away um that might have been someone you need to go high gotten your locker\nAnd we're just getting more and more of that and then that was also collaborated by the headlines we seen every year we see students being told they can't do things like say the name of Jesus and a graduation speech or just basic\nUh the religious freedom expressions that should be there right\nSo we were just looking for a thon celebratory way too are my kids what their basic religious freedom rights are and just to let them know they're not alone in expressing their fate\nAnd it just took off you know beyond our while this expectation that actually surprised us because we went from eight thousand kids in two thousand fourteen to half a million last year so it's really resonated with students'\nParents have to encourage their kids to do this or do you couldn't do hope the kids are going to buy into this if they're just told about it\nSections stand by themselves or others were asked most significant they unfold kind of progression and asks us fought a spiritual progress through the various stanzas of the saw one thing we want to be looking at as we look\nNow if you follow the end I be translation which is what we have to do is why we have in front of us you'll notice that in the first six verses of the songs are Eighteen occurrences of the first person singular pronoun that's on fire me Eighteen of them\nAnd that compares with six references to God either\nSo emphasis in the\nFirst part of the song is on the ... himself over gone by\nOur proportion of three to one have you go to the end of the song of the last eight versus that is Thirteen through twenty you find that there are Twenty one mentions of God and no personal references that all\nThe only possible exception is one plural possessive our which occurs inverse Thirteen so if you don't studying\nAt any other law than that if you're just looking at the pronouns you understand what is happening here as he is moving away from thoughts that are concentrated on himself the thoughts that are concentrated on gone and you'll see that that makes a big difference now the first ends up as composed versus one too\nAnd they're an expression of his plane is what I was mentioning earlier rather than seem to be working in his life anymore doesn't seem to be working in the life of the nation he had done\nThe bullet remembers it that's what he's going to be talking about and the second stands up but what he's talking about here is this problem\nYou look at first to when you say well he seems to be on the right track what he says inverse too is is when I was in distress I saw the lord you say oh yeah that's just the thing you want to do he doesn't right at the beginning but that's not what he means by that I didn't mean to stop the lord and toward wasn't there\nHe's really complaining you see so even when he brings gone in to that first ... it's a way of saying but God was ...\nGo to the next versus say at night I stretched out I'm tiring hands and my soul refused to become a straight shot his hands asking for God to give him something in his hands were empty that's what he's saying one of the ...\nThe commentators on the psalm ass is almost question is why why does God let things go on as long as tragically as they do without giving any tokens of his interest and concern of you'd never experience that you haven't been a Christian very long or you're not a Christian at all\nBecause all of us go through times like that you pray and you just don't seem to get an answer you remember better days and the president that seems to be a contrast well\nI asked that question again if you ever felt that\nOr most of us will say yes at times and it's almost will say yes I'm feeling that way right now\nThat's exactly what my condition is now we're going to see how we moved from that what kind of progress you got a before we move on notice again the pronouns and the stands and the stanza\nAsset is pre occupied with himself a pro down by a car is five times and the pronouns me or my car twice more now that's all right or wrong was saying this is the way I feel because I really do feel this way\nPilots not afraid of the truth\nAnd so that's the way you feel you need to talk about\nIs not moving on from there say some of his bogged down at\nPoint we never get to thinking about God and that's what's wrong we have to go on there's no point rehearsing are disappointments endlessly\nWell last moves on we're going to see how about the second stands up versus three Bruce sex or ones which he tells a reader or a little bit more about his depressed state of mind and he says I\nAlready pointed out that\nBothers him as remembers days that were better you say there never been any better day when the loan any better but he remembers how good it used to be a matter\nThat we're remember is the important word in the stands up\nThat appears again stands for here is remembering his former happiness a little later on what he remembers as the mighty deeds of God and that's a significant shift in his focus but see Harry's remembering the past\nNow I think you have to get into the spirit of these versus a little bit you just have to read the perceptive lead to see what's really going on first verse as I remember a Jew old dog\nLike I said at the beginning and that's something that sounds good doesn't it and the second ... said when I was in distress I saw the lord and here in the third verse he says I remember\nOh God that sounds fine what he's saying is that when he saw the lord lord wasn't there and when they remembered God well\nWhy do you remember it as if things had been good and I got a forgotten them and say as you read on what you find is that he's really still thinking about himself I remembered you God but I'm Still the way I Am\nI think God's pushed off the periphery the best thing we can say about the second stems is that his focus is beginning to shift albeit slightly\nSay instead of merely thinking about how miserable he is he's at least thinking that there was a time when he was ... and what made it not miserable in the ... that God was there\nOr you may be saying God you're not here now but nevertheless he's beginning to shift albeit slightly\nThere's still an awful lot of eyes and the ... six of them\nWere ... four more times good Mitt but they say is beginning to change just a little bit\nAbout in the next ... he's going to develop this a little bit at least he has begun to think about God please mention God\nAnd so now he begins to go with it just a little bit more God's seems to have been absent will abandon him and he tells the kind of questions that we are going through his mind as he thinks about this he ask a series of questions that rhetorical questions\nHe doesn't answer the questions he throws out but here they are ours is seven and on with the lord reject us forever well they never show is favored again as as an failing love vanished forever as his promise failed for all time is the forgotten to be merciful has he in anger withheld has compassion see that's what he thinks is happening\nAnd you say the very articulation of the questions begins to suggest the answer you see I Believe it or can't raise a question like that an answer it negatively\nOr the lord\nReject this forever war they never show was favor yeah physical force not\nA faithful\nSo although he's raising these questions in a negative way saying this is what I'm feeling that's just the distress I have at least he's raising the questions is articulating let me thinking theologically is beginning to draw them back into contemplating a very character of God and when he does that say the answer\nBegins the bubble to the surface no of course thought are gone it's not like that he does not change she does not break his promises is Mercedes wife does Morsi's or knew every morning\nOh if\nIt was almost doesn't believe that God is favorable\nAnd loving and ... and most of all I'm faithful\nThere was promises is because he's not seeing things correctly that is it's almost like something's wrong you have\nTo look at it again remember\nThe apostle Paul wrote in Romans while said let God be true in every ... might seem that God is in through\nThe guard is and solve the problem is in us I was looking to pronouns again in the stands as in the last ... he began to consider God though in a negative way and this ... references to God predominate still negative questions but at least\nHe's not in it and it's gone there instead the more diverse seven God inverse nine and the pronouns he or his throughout at least\nSix times\nAlexander McLaren is another one of the great commentators on the ... and he thinks about this a little Biddy says doubts are better put in the planes speech than lying diffused and darkening\nLike poisonous miss in the\nHeart I suppose that's right isn't it\nTo be a dollar than somebody who is strong and face but if you're downing is better at least to express it that's what McLaren is saying that's true isn't it so some people\nPride in the negative\n... they're delighted to be agnostics they're proud of it they're not really searching for answers are unbelievers we're proud of their own believe there\nI'd had contact with a lot of them they they kind of thing people to believe that if things are simple ... because well I'm really deeply the way I Hope you doubt like do you see and I\nAs as far better to be a man or woman the fate but\nIf you are doubting it's better to articulate it because you don't get anywhere but just sort of models around there and the by what you need to say is this is what I'm doubting and this is why\nAnd or is that right they did something major up against what I Know of the character of God and that's the first night versus I told you that's the first time that's the downward side you begin to get a change in Merced Tammy from this point on us all\nWith ... ten is that it's

I\nDon't have to go to someone else to have access to God I go directly to God for myself that may talk to you about our privileges a priest Hebrew shepherd ten versus Nineteen and twenty listen to it\nHaving therefore brethren bonus dinner into the holiest\nBy the blood of Jesus through a new and living way which he has ... created for us through the ... that is to say his flash you say what does that\nMean [laughter] but I tell you in the Old Testament the temple had three parts they ought to court the court and the animals court ... court was called the inner ... them all the ... and only the priest could go in there the hyper he's once a year to make a tone for the people\nAnd he had to just looked up the corner of the veil and he would slip under and he would go on and sprinkled blow up on the ... seat and if anyone else women or anybody went in without blood\nImmediately sudden death\nAnd the people had to stay outside and the priest went in on their behalf\nBut you remember when Jesus Christ died the Bible tells us that the veil of the temple was torn into from top to bottom not from the bottom to the top but from the top to the bottom not as though man had done it but as the God has done it which indeed the hat\nNow that was highly symbolic all because Jesus Christ was saying by his death\nNo more animal sacrifices are needed\nBy his death that Old Testament economy is done and that every one of us now have become breeze and every one of us can enter into the holy moly have you been there yet today I have\nI have come boldly into the whole way of whole east to meet with model or a lot of privilege I tell you the most sacred privilege that we have\nAbsolutely totally beyond a shadow of any doubt or bird venture\nIs to go into that holding place and how often we neglected we come by the blood of Jesus combo way before the growing up raised\nTo find help in time of need oh dear friend how we ought to be going and exercising our privileges priest but what is our practice as priest look at it again the Bible says inverse five were to offer a spiritual sacrifices\nNow and the Old Testament that priest would offer an animal sacrifice\nWhat do I offer\nRomans twelve one says I'm to present my body ain't living sacrifice a man\nHere I Am lord I get myself away does all that I can do and the Old Testament the priest would burn incense what do I do\nWell the Bible says here in Hebrew chapter Thirteen burst Fifteen I Am to offer to him the sacrifice of praise continually that is just as the incense would be going up\nOut of that temple out of my heart out of my live day by day moment by moment there's to be praised the my wonderful lord that's why I Do as a believer breeze I'm offering the\nVice not of em sense but a\nLot of of blood or some bowl or go to land those things are done\nBut I present my pie hey Lou sacrifice my practice as a priest is just sacrifice\nAre you doing it now let me talk to you not only about our privilege in our practice but let me talk to you about our profession as a priest\nLooking burst nine in the Bible says but you also\nAre a chosen generation a royal priesthood\nA holy nation a peculiar people that you should show for the praises\nOf him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light\nThey don't want them to be doing as a priest I'm to be making God known to man and I'm debris bringing man the God\nTelling people I'm to represent God man word unmanned got word\nAnd so are you I Am to make known his praising I made to show for his praises IMDB professing him\nDid you know and by the way\nI Want you to drop this worst down and your margin so you can read when you get home exodus chapter twenty eight versus thirty three thirty five you know what that tells us that tells

would go into minister that people will be listening for the bells and I didn't hear the bells I say oh got killed in\nBecause the Bible says if those bells didn't ring he'd\nDie into you know what

here we are to show for his prey why when I preach\nI say come openly and publicly confessed Christ\nWhat a week in the beltway that makes our typical partisan politics looked like a play around the stage before the eyes of the country this week\nUgly uncaring crash do come near to what transpired in the new phase of judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing it was an effort in a new sort of ... the as soon as I argued over at the Washington Post this week\nThe Democrats will ultimately share the credit for seeking to ruin the lives of Brett Kavanaugh and his family\nHad likely is accuser Christine Blasey Ford Elite media outlets said their part in the facilitates the allegations in the Washington Post and the New Yorker and then it was something of a free for all\nOne qualified legal observer professor Alan Dershowitz retired now from Harvard law school a lifelong liberal now moving somewhere near the center late waved to the Democrats cynical miscarriage of this confirmation proceedings my colleague Dennis Prager took a closer look\nLet me read to you from Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz\nAnd his description of what is happening\n... denied the appointment it will be because he has been depicted as a sexual predator who deserves contempt origin impossible imprisonment\nHe may no longer be able to teach law coach sports or expect to be treated respectfully he could be forced to resign his current traditional position because having the coat convicted unquote rapist on the benches unseemly\nFor these reasons he now has the right perhaps not a legal rights butter right based on fundamental fairness to have the charges against him put to the test of clear and convincing evidence or some standard close to that\nA judge Kavanaugh been rejected an ideological professional grounds before the sordid accusations were leveled he could go back to his life Robert Bork did but if the Senate fails to confirm him now his life will never be the same\nBut this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice is about the most fundamental issue affair issues of fairness this country has faced since the McCarthy Era\nThe American civil liberties union stood strong against McCarthyism by demanding due process and hard evidence but the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote be resolved against the accused nominee\nBut we now live in an age that risks a new form of sexual McCarthyism\nWe must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism liberal Democrats Harvard law professor\nDarker than McCarthy has\nEven though if you read the report of racial Mitchell woman who seems to have asked you know very on challenging questions\nThe wall Street Journal published her entire analysis I can only provide Bonnie assessment of talked to for the allegations in a legal context\nAnd the legal context here as my bottom line a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove what this case is even weaker than that\nThis is from Rachel Mitchell a prosecutor of sex crimes tucked the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate though\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee newer nor do I believe that there's evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence then do you understand the difference folks\nThere there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt but outside of the legal world all you need is the ... I think in the ... from not mistaken in civil suits\nThe preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just ... but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\nThe Republicans seem to show absolutely fairness of the accuser and giving deference wavering members in his own caucus delayed the confirmation one vote one week as the FBI made additional inquiries\nAs mid week I spoke with the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice [noise] now\nIf in fact we get word that the FBI is done and that should all centers will have the report it's okay to file the notion of culture because that says thirty hours of debate people will have plenty of time to read the report\nThat is right down to the Senate rules are there will be at least a an intervening day or the other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cloture vote wouldn't be until the following day so there'll be plenty of time for senators to read the FBI's a supplemental background investigation\nSenator I represented the victim of the sexual assault on a major college campus I catch a more because of confidentiality I'm very sympathetic to that kind of because the institutions in America have not yet adopted to deal with these but that they're changing nevertheless I'm a lawyer like you and I know one\nOf the fear of flying narrative that was given to the committee that simply wasn't true it wasn't given by her I was getting by the lawyers her ex boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she is familiar with polygraphs inconsistent with their testimony testimony and this is a lawyer deal\nCould not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one that could be disproven that's very rare and then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there are problems with her testimony\nWhile there are some allies of well a ritual Mitchell a who was retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um and I thought that a very professional job\nBut I thought she got the basic facts out the demonstrated that there are gaps I understand the victims of of trauma can have memory lapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after thirty five years but I just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that uncorroborated\nAllegations should be enough to a ... a a nominee\nSo let's go to the last issue which is Jerry ... Adler the incoming chairman of the house Judiciary Committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays he will hold each month proceedings I say bring those on because they will be laughing stock about Seventy rule I just got into it she said Brett Kavanaugh why I said he absolutely did not lie about drinking did not lie about devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a center\nWell I think it's this has gotten a a ridiculous absurd we're talking about in prison as high school yearbook whether he threw ice on somebody at some point in the past um I think they've been unsuccessful in attacking the judges credibility\nAnd feel like a now they're all from this wild goose chase and uh the goalposts as five friend the majority leaves like say a ... continue to move a but it's time to vote\nHere's what Lindsey Graham said on Fox News last night cut number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats I think they're toast\nAll of them all of them\nAll of them politically in any of the only people that are open seemingly ... even though there are no senator\nCornyn Joni Ernst agreed with that do you agree with that\nI I agree uh because I think I'm In these red states that President Trump carried a I think that uh I think the judicial I I'm Sorry I just I think the Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are confirming what are the ones you just said\nAs the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to you\nOr we talked Cory Gardner who's the chairman this year as a as ... as basically confirmed\nThat yes now I think something very big is going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the visceral rejection of McCarthyism directed\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw his hat them and judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry or what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and this ah this ridiculous allegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or hug not display the appropriate temperament on the bench\nThis man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nUh there were a couple of times where I think well one time in particular where he asked judge or to their corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut uh he shouldn't be expected just to take\nA business slander these allegations of criminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position who feels like they had been falsely accused I think would be angry and be justified in showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be a ... some good faith because of the FBI report not to vote for\nUm judge Kaplan I I think it will be a huge mistake unless they're a threat corroborating evidence but I also believe the Republican doesn't support him his or her career done as a Republican I've never seen the base this way is that the general sense in the cockpit\nI think you'll see overwhelming support in the caucus for ah for the judge\nIn the middle of this political debacle another letter blurred at there was from the president of the American bar association Robert Carlson says my Salem colleague Larry Elder swimmer that letter that the\nPresident of the ... cents urging the Senate Judiciary committee to hold off voting on\nHad a big victory here first she got Mexico to sign on and then you know tighten the screws on Canada and they made some real concessions cheer Larry that they didn't want to they didn't want to make and now they're sets up Trump very nicely\nFor negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come to hopefully with China because they they are the worst abusers of portrayed laws in on the planet\nOne other quick thing Larry I was there at the rose garden when Donald Trump got his part Scott Brown from one of the points you made\nAs he said look I Want to use these tariffs has a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with the tactic but what is it working because these countries are reducing their cherished\nEven a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries\nAnd the University of Chicago survey of top economists found Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off close but with NAFTA than the previous trade deal so when President Trump keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI did you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped draft now they're back in Nineteen Ninety three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved this was the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement it's now called the U. S. M. C. A. we're not going to call NAFTA any longer but it is a new on North American trade agreement that will open up orders a between all three countries\nIs modernized because America has a better deal and\nUh so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing a minimum wage on other countries should write a new that's one of the things I don't like about this do you also got me on that one that is not you know we would we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan a show I mean I agree with you on that\nOne so on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for that the candidate has imposed against us and Louis terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just in just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of you know as you know we talked about this on your show the war and more what Americans producers called intellectual property there's\nComputer software we Patton sent copyrights and and uh acknowledge each and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and something certainly trying on and many other countries and Asian countries they just steal our intellectual property and this new uh I'll call it the U.S she already has much better protections\nFor not America's intellectual property so countries are going to use our products they actually pay for them to the entire interview with economist Stephen Moore on tonal review dot com coming up\nOn and then we in hours of taxpayer money went to prepare religion America's religion for the discovery of extra terrestrial\nLife sounding the alarm on bureaucratic waste women tell all review return ...\nGood news you are not stuck with your health care plan\nReally you have a choice that it's a great when it's called met a share and if you've heard about it and wondered what exactly it is it's a way that people share their health care bills and these are people who have a common face you want to be part of something beautiful that not only make their health care needs but the needs of others too\nAnd it's people who love to save money big time met her she remembers tips\nThey say five hundred dollars a month per family on their health care cost that is a life changing for people so this could be for you maybe it's what you been looking for a way to pay health care bills that's not only very smart financially but it's even\nProfound medicine here as a non profit with four hundred thousand members nationwide pray for and share with each other\nSo yeah so you're not stuck there is another way and that could save you a lot find\nOut more call a three three thirty nine Bible that the three three thirty nine Bible a three three thirty nine Bible\nOn those serving in our military\nThere the difference makers\nSeparated from family enduring hardships far from home\nSacrificing for their country\nWhile serving in a different country\nWell for those of us who support our armed forces to us so\nWe get to make a difference to\nWe get to be the force that delivers the phone call between spouse and deployed service member of\nThe force that brings new born in New parents together\nThrough a delivery room video check\nIn the force that make sure our military serving seven thousand miles away\nGets to watch the game from us so center [noise]\nWe get to be the force behind the forces connecting them to every comfort of family\nTo us so that was slashed forced to learn how you can be the force behind the forces [noise]\n\nJustice is he's lost injustice which you know\nWorks for a large corporation they have a weekend over time up until recently it was on a seniority basis and she was high enough where she wasn't mandated to work on on the weekend for the group decided they took a vote because it is a union shop that they were had changed it to a point system\nWith her not working on Sundays she doesn't get those points she ended up getting mandated every Sunday\nLet me tell you what I'm going to do first and we get in touch with the lawyers here at the American Center for Law Justice for the the fact is the union can't override a federal statute titled seven says they're supposed to make a reasonable a combination of us it's really a religious practice which means a situation like your wife\nIf she wants to worship on Sunday there are other people that can work that is one that sounds like there are they should be accommodating ... religious\nBusiness at the C.

I'm Sorry I bear market is typically define as one uh that has a ... percent or more drop so if you think of a barrier kind of going into hibernation\nThat might be a good example of a bear market kind of hibernating is pulling back it's it's for whatever reasons whether they're imagined are real and usually it's a little bit of both\nThan a bear market polls us back twenty percent or more\nAnd um you know it could be more than one index it could be just one index but typically they all pulled back kind of together at least uh two or three main ones which is the the Dow the S P and the NASDAQ so used to see one two or three of those pulling back\nUm and then again I'm not talking about one day or one week thing and that's what makes it so difficult to discern\nIs you know we may lose seven hundred points in one day at the beginning of a bear market will will know the next week right you know ... it's a six hundred the next day it's now two hundred and that's the volatility a so no don't anybody tell you they know when the ... gonna began they don't they can gas they can look at numbers\nBut it will happen when it happened so\nThat's kind of note number one we don't know when it's going to happen okay so\nWe need to prepare for it because we think it's going to happen soon\nAnd the reason we think is going to happen soon is it's been almost ten years since the last a bear market\nAnd that is the second longest bull market or in us history and so we may break her record become the longest bull market I Hope we do\nBut I'm the chances of pulling back here and the next three weeks three months when you hear is getting greater and greater so just like a good holistic financial planner would do we are preparing our clients and or for that occurrence\nAnd we are in the you know the last thing is as we get a market drop of seven hundred in the day I don't get any phone calls 'cause my clients understand what we're doing our doing it and that actually it is opportunities being created and that's a pretty good feeling\nNow we have to take a quick break but is there anything you'd like to add for listeners mark before we take this break\nSomething exciting coming up we do have a another class coming up here locally in the Atlanta area it actually starts this coming Saturday\nUm and ah so ah what I Would have either do is to go to our website says we do replace some of these shows and see where the next class is coming up\nBut go to the website which is master planned retired dot com and go under upcoming events and they will be one or two classes listed were always have a couple of coming up one coming up here shortly is in the Kennesaw\nSmyrna Marietta area kind of the northwest quadrant of Atlanta it is a college style course it is a five hour course over two Saturdays\nYou receive a workbook course book white papers studies and we do um or I Do a graph I think a great job of presenting the information from a standpoint of experience and telling stories of people and how they've approached seventies problems so you actually walk away\nWith a really nice um [noise] I'm understanding of what you need to be doing and how you do it and then the third part of the course of the two classes\nIs a sit down one on one with me to kind of help you round out that planned you've been working on during the class so\nReally exciting it's forty nine dollars if you register ahead of time that's for one or two people uh partners are are couples or whatever it may be and so um I really encourage you to check out the website and take a look at that\nAnd see if it's something that would help you if not we have two more classes coming up over the next two months so you will find at least the next one listed there and and then who was the one in June listed very shortly\nSo that would be the biggest thing otherwise again as I've always said we uh we have time for for four or five folks that listen to the show to schedule a a complementary consultation one on one with me here the office are one of our satellite offices and that's just a time to sit down and talk about your problems or issues\nFinancially and um let us run some numbers for you can see where you stand rent some reports\nAnd let's see what problems you may have and maybe even discuss some solutions so\nAgain a good way to schedule that is the website master planned retired dot com or a give us an old fashioned telephone call seven seven to nine eight or nine to six to seven seven o nine eight or nine to six to hope to hear from you guys\nAre right and listeners state June we're going to be right back was more of mark Frick Iran financially tune\nYou ever feel like you need ...
