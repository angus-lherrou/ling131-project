the ...\nOf God's mercy Tim keller welcome in\nI'm ready to go out to be with you it is also my wife's favorite of the books or the favorite book\nIs that right now you write in the book that she had heard you teach through Jonah verse verse in three different settings three different churches um and she's the one who wanted you to do this book\nYeah she wanted to be the first book and we kept putting it off as part of the reason for that actually is that the book of job that doesn't have a single topic ah you know ... books do better if it's a book on prayer or suffering or something like that\nBut the book of Jonas as short as it is is very rich and\nIt's about so many different things and it's one of the reasons why I think my editors would always say well what's that about and we said well a lot this well let's just something else to finally get they get what she has a it's just too good and so now we are\n... is it is too good and so when you started in front of how long ago was that\nIt was a book out of ... all that well\nThe book was only about a year and a half ago but I had these I preach to the book in Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen Ninety One and two thousand one so I had three sets of sermons and each time it the ... the servants were actually a bit different because each time it was a different place at a different time\nAnd I began to see how rich the book was because there was always something for every ... and uh so I basically took all that material and uh and then about the moment now you know as I was actually ... now and that's what we have it inside the covers their\nCould you ever have imagined when you started preaching on however many years ago that was and then you started to compile the book a year ago that it would be an apropos as it is right now based on our political climate in America\n[noise] well I I I'll go back to what I said I think no matter what the climate was if it was different there'd be some other aspects of the book but what you're referring to is the fact that one of the ways you can read the book\nIs the first two chapters a show that refuses to go tell the truth or he was called to go to Syria\nAnd tell them the truth we warned them ... judgment he refuses to tell the truth is ... he goes to tell the truth but he doesn't do it in la mhm he and that's the reason why God says\nYou went to the city but you didn't love the city and at the very end got to say why don't you have compassionate city so in our current cultural moment to be told that even if the other side seems to to be horrible you must always speak the truth I Love it was always do it\nIt was always do that you are a recipient of mercy just like they need to pass for a seat and there shouldn't be any superiority of the people have a different race of a different religion or people have different ...\nYou have to always be the truth I'm up now that just that just screams out of the book right now because of our cultural moment I'm just here to tell you the word of God is alive and living in that if you were in some other situations other time the book would be screaming something else that trip but right now it's amazingly well\nYeah and I feel like that's what we need to hear it and because of my job I have to be on social media quite a bit and it Tim it's a it's a cesspool [laughter] tell ya I mean and the reason it just ... it sucks I send a text me and\nUm it's not that I'm pointing at everybody and Twitter and saying oh my gosh you know the debauchery and they're saying that it makes me\nAbsolutely as simple as anyone else to the kind of the kind of medical machinations that just and then you you you send your your hour or two hours or whatever it is you spend on it and by the end you are not the person that God wants you to be I'm convinced that it\nActually you know two or three years ago a woman named uh Sherry Turkle who works at a she teaches at MIT\nPolitical called clay reclaiming conversation and apart from the politics of it she says studies show that the more you're on social media the less empathetic you've become that is a hard it is for you to put yourself the shoes of other people because what social media does is they're very brief\nA state as we make and everything is oversimplified everything's flat we're we just reduce people\nAre we reduced people to the basics I don't think of them is full of people and we don't have the the strengths and weaknesses so the political situation right now on social media is toxic and the book of Joe ... says you have to have compassion on the people that you're telling the truth to or you're just not reflecting God\nOkay tend to be spent a lot of time with Jonah so to speak over the last decade or so or tell us what John is like\nFirst of all these kind of sympathetic as it is as soon as you get into the to the if you start to dump on him you have to remember is being asked to go to a country of a city or probably kill him at least they have a good\nYou know there are violent people and to go out there a and actually preach right in a city I was taking life for this and secondly these were people who were almost like ISIS they were kind of like a terrorist a country and they were threatening Israel and as soon as you realize\nThat he's being asked to go show with those of stretch out the prospect of receipts with very evil group of people you could start to say oh\nYeah no wonder he wondering is having a struggle and you begin to say hey often got says things or does things that I don't understand too\nBut then on the other side a ... you have to fall is the opposite of the good Samaritan he's the very opposite 'cause when Jesus as tall as asked you know how do I love my neighbor Jesus does the matinees planning to a man who loves someone\nOf a different race and religion and that's very significant that when\nJesus was asked to tell me how to let my neighbor he gives us an example of somebody who loves someone practically at risk as a shield itself to someone of a different race religion and here's Jonah looking at somewhat of a different race or religious thing I don't want to risk my life I don't want to do anything for them I Want them to be judged by what the destroy\nYour sympathetic and then you realize he's exactly the opposite of what God in the Bible is calling us\nTo be coming up the former fire chief of\nI was literally fired for what the Bible says about marriage and sexuality\nWe hear from Cochran when the Christian out in terms of the moment\n\nI'm Andrew Solomon this week is national business women's week at a time to promote advancement opportunities for women according to a University of Phoenix survey eighty six percent of

their careers to explore the university's educational resources\nAnd furthermore it's written into the uh\nLiturgy or one of the day is on the Jewish calendar it's the ninth of the month of up and that's a day that celebrates the temples destruction\nSo at least the juicy up that way and probably we should see it that way as well about the outline of the song\nIt's possible that divided very well according to the stands as the new international version which is what most of us use certainly they are divided it up he magically\nSlightly different idea in those two middle stanza is the only correction I Would make it that's what we follow is the first twelve ought to belong with a third stanza embers Thirteen really should stand by itself\nMay cause verse twelve is part of the prayers asking God to do something and then\nToward the future and\nAnticipating God's answer to the prayers as this one is going to be\nIn the future day so we want to outline that that's the way I Would handle it\nWell I've already commented on\nThis man assets distress of the destruction of Jerusalem when we were considering solemn Seventy four and you can think back to that you may recall that in that song ...\nHand and walk them through the ruins\nNow it's a bit different here there are some similarities\nBoth of the psalms ask God how long this terrible state has to continue\nTo use the word forever or is that to go on forever and dissolves asked that are both ask God to rise up and destroy those who have destroyed Judah\nAs enemies the Babylonians both look forward to a day when the people of God\nWill be able to praise him for his mighty acts of deliverance once again and again praised him for that now because everything's in ruins but one day\nOr looking ahead to that so these two sons are alike and it really makes us think that they must be by the same author and he's got the same mindset he's thinking the same way but there are differences and the chief differences what is bothering the ... and that earlier so I'm not really was bothering assault most of the temple was destroyed\nA stanza which you talked about that is the one where we ask God to walk through the ashes and look at the ruins of this this was your temple is that where we used to come and worship you look what's happened to it\nThat's why these distressed about in some Seventy nine that we're looking at now what he seems to be chiefly concerned about is the people\nIs concerned about those who have been killed because their bodies are lying in the street there's nobody there to bury them he\nThere's concern for those were taken prisoner many were carried off the Bible on\nOf the leaders were taken away that\nFor those who are left behind desolate are always some people that don't get deported\nAnd so here they are Straggler scattered around in this impoverished lab he's concerned for all these people and that's the way the ...\nHad described the terrible days that would come and one of the things he has said Jeremiah seven thirty three is that there would be so many dead and so few survivors of the would be no one to bury the dead\nIt was a terrible thing was a disgrace to be able to bury the dead it would be bad enough in our culture was particularly bad for them it was disrespect and all of that\nOf a disaster of this magnitude\nI don't believe there are people who go through it\nAnd other parts of the world but I'd be very surprised if there's any one among us has ever gone through anything quite like this because this was the literal\nDestruction of everything they\nEverything they knew the destruction was political first of all because of the nation no longer existed\nAren't any nobles wasn't in the army was any government all that was going off 'cause everybody was on their own nation was gone and destruction was economic\nIt goes the land was devastated nobody can make a living\nThe little houses the artisans were destroyed and even the artisans where they are the houses were intact that would be nobody with any money to buy any of those things that they produce aisle economically\nWas devastated\nThe destruction was social entire families were wiped out\nA husband or wife or\nWas total destruction of the families\nAnd many were carried away as prisoners\nAnd the destruction was religious\nMay cause the religion of the people was centered in Jerusalem and its temple\nAnd the sacrifices in the priesthood\nThat was gone you just can't imagine a greater destruction\nAs I've said and yeah it's you and I was ... things come into our lives it really hurt and so the question we ask what you want to learn from the ... deals with him\nAnd his son was not searching for an answer the song is the answer\nAnd you say at that point well what is the answer that\nAnswers hanging on to God\nEven in the most terrible times not\nGiving up your old on guard\nMembers hanging on by faith I notice you find it at the very beginning don't you hear is describing this terrible destruction but notice he speaks of these enemies as having invaded watch your inheritance as God's inheritance is he's he's he's still in touch with God\nAnd is having to fly out your holy temple is God's temple that's been the filed and having given the bodies of your service as food to the birds of the air and the pleasure of your savings to the base of the year or\nWhat he's saying at the very beginning as even\nThe people of suffered a great calamity they are nevertheless the people of the living God it was the song begins with that and it ends with that\nWhat it's really doing is hanging on to go out\nAnd so the question for us we want to major ourselves by the experience and the fate of the most is simply this do we have that kind of confidence in God bad things come into our lives are due to all of us sooner or later on when they when they come to you is sort of lose everything off your hand in this fair or\nYou hang on to God\nAnd that's what this almost does [noise] but I still stands as if we follow the\nDivision of the new international version really describe how he does that and in my judgment their best taken together\nBecause they really can tighten the substance of this almost prayer there's different questions which is why the new international version divide 'em up the first one I ask how long oh lord well you'll be angry forever\nHow long were you er jealousy burn like fire that's the same question that was asking solemn Seventy four verse tan and then\nNext when asked third one of the song asked why should the nation's say where is their God that's a different question\nThey're both the same thing really because what they're doing is asking God to help\nIt's almost as described how bad things are\nTemples gone people or deport in many of them are dead or\nIs this going to go on won't you help us God that is what he's trying to say and\nThese ... of the rest of the law really does that I think the way to do is walk up ... points they make at least four of\nFirst of all there's the question that I mentioned how long will this punishment last that's often asked by God's persecuted people\nThe people to God don't complain about their punishment being unjustly know their centers\nAnd do they continue to send and thought word indeed and sell their shaking their fists in the face of God and say oh\nThis happen to us it's it's not a question about\nBut they are hurting say\nSo a lot of not complaining\nHow long is it going to go on I you know I'm just human and you know that I you know my brain you know and just does how long is this going to go on I'm not sure I'm able to handle it much longer\nQuestion throughout the Bible you find it in revelations six ten\nThe renamed in heaven or looking\nThe martyrs and they're saying how long the God are you going to tolerate away your martyrs or being treated when are you going to avenge them as a question saying the gossip and\nAsk them

went off to a cordon corner of the garden because he was so upset he was crying over his condition and he says there either I prayed he said not indeed and these exact words yet for this purpose I

is that your shepherd\nLong do is walk these as I said I'm the good shepherd I give my life for the she was given his life for you\nTrust them as the one who gave his life for you\nYou said when he

suffering for you or you know the suffering for you but real centers and send demands a payment and that payment for him is suffering so he was our substitution or sacrifice\nSecondly he was are suffering sacrifice thirdly I Want to say he was our settled sacrifice not pay attention here look at look at the scripture game for Christ also have what's that next word\nWas suffer want suffered you know what that means that means he suffered never to suffer again he died never die again this word wants to do is not me once like once upon a time\nThat literally means once for all that he has suffered and he's not going to die upon the cross again it has probably been paid you see when Jesus Christ died upon the cross he said it is finished\nAnd he bought his head and cry that heat is finished three words in English language one word and the Greek language\nThose in North Dakota Indiana Florida but nothing more than Missouri doesn't come a Democrat Claire McCaskill wants to hang on to her seat against her very able challenger Missouri's attorney general Josh Hawley my colleague Larry Elder spoke with James O'Keefe of project maritime\nThis time keeps investigative team do deep inside the McCaskill campaign\nWe've got some news because Claire McCaskill charged responded to our hidden camera investigation she attacked a video of course she made a false statement in this state and she put out a she said that the Republican candidate for Senator John Paul II\nHad brought you normally embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct I had nothing to do with Josh ... never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved in this investigation\nAnd just to your listeners know our investigation McCaskill's campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that her and McCaskill on about his policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that uh other staffers talked about banning semi automatic rifles and mechanical herself was caught on camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that there would be a gun than the sum type so McCaskill's now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nDreams of teeth I looked at the video not only does the Stanford talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they're talking about and guns\nClara herself talks about um once you get into the actual vote with the so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there's the red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are moderate they're not ... they're they're they're moderate to pro life pro gun Democrats external thing in Missouri going in these states so whether it's an aspiration exposure is is that in order to get elected\nIn order to get elected you have to lie to people and that's what they are open staffers are saying he's saying the moderate we'll just have to get over being lied to very devastating very powerful\nI mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done because it involved hitting US Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling or wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill response James okay\nWell it is some startling and Josh how I Would be part of fraudulently and betting on me and my campaign\nUm he's the attorney general of the famous Harry he's supposed to be going after fried\nNot participating in it [laughter] so um there was nothing there have been very upfront about all my positions I made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment really telling about this\nIs how far they're willing to go to ... somebody in my campaign\n[noise] well first of all it does it mean to both the fly it's categorically unequivocally falls\nGet Josh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I've never met him and she didn't live on local TV in Missouri Larry what's gonna happen next to this other Senate candidate John always say that he had nothing\nTo do with it she's going to respond to that so I think were were cheating on our goal of holding people accountable and I think that she's in a lose lose situation\nFor hurricane that ravaged the Florida Panhandle northward from the Gulf was horribly unpredictable so that does not pass thirty Kendall air force base near Panama City took a serious and it's one of the science of or a league esque twenty two fighter jets wage anyone concerned with our nation's fighting ability to be concerned about that\nI turned to a regular on my program Congressman Mike Gallagher of the house armed services committees are defence expert at a Marine Corps intelligence veteran himself\nGet right down to it the danger zone has receded according to I'm reading a real clear politics story here the congressional leadership fund has seen see six districts will heard Andy Barr might cost Rodney Davis Brian Mast John Katko receipt and to save comfortable territory\nIt if we're down to twenty to thirty districts that are competitive and very sound pretty optimistic it on hold my house or Mike Gallagher what do you think\nWell this is anecdotal but certainly in the Republican Party ... as we have around my district in northeast Wisconsin we've seen an upsurge in volunteers coming in people coming in\nThat aren't necessarily party faithful to\nPick up signs and ask what can I Do to help so I Do sense they slight\nMomentum shift I've always thought this was going to be a nice day when we talk about control the house you know five seats one way or the other ... but also my understanding is that our we have real opportunities to pick up some seats from Democrats in Minnesota and that the Democrats are pulling out of a couple of states that\nLook if you try to get our direction so again we got to run through that you have\nThis is you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't take anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down the candidate quality and sort of the twenty to thirty states that we're talking about here\nSo let me talk to you about some defense issues first of all the F twenty twos at ten dull a it's a murky picture or I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt that bad but maybe we did get hurt that bad maybe a things to stealth technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment at why by the way do we keep after twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell you try to read through this and I'm looking forward to being back in session in November So we can ask the hard questions of the deal aid figure out what exactly happened\nIt seems like Seventeen twenty Jews are damaged I think ten of those are cats and the storm rated hangar but no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus miles per hour winds and seven of the seven of the Seventeen were in Leicester rated hangers\nI think it's important to note that no one thought this would be a four to five little avert imported our fire I'm not trying to make excuses for the military here on the planes are basic and those that they can have access to the training range of of the Gulf of Mexico no one would want a budget that twenty two going into super cruise over Kansas it's too disturbing to the local community\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country\nSo as best I can tell him talking to officials plug it experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be repaired but the problem here is the skin on the plane there's a lot of radar absorbent material ram involved and the repairing and replacing it'd be very expensive and my understanding of the initial site survey suggests that the air frames\nAppear to be okay so we believe we can get most of them back\nOn track repairing the skins um will be a very expensive proposition finally I just say I'm going to your question you know why we're so many their ground this goes back\nReally to the Obama administration decision to hold the program the two thousand nine factory gates was the ultimate decided that decision and the decision to cut back on the air force personnel and train maintain ers and funds for reading it so we had to answer the reason that the question that so many were on the ground in the first place\nWith their engines pulled it because of the lack of spare parts and a lack\nOf trained people ... president enjoying worthy

President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a rogue operator before the Saudis have begin

I didn't I didn't quite understand that but we've\nWell sued on behalf of the chief the good news is is that we argue that the policy they actually required prior permission so they told the chief\nAfterward that oh no you can't write a book on your own time for a Bible study unless you get prior permission from the city and the city allows you to do so we challenge that as being unconstitutional he's only five permission needed in the first amendment and the judge ruled with us\nI'm so that the judge ruled in favor the cheap and now we're going to trial to figure out where the case goes for there and and how much damage is for the chief\nOn tests or at terrific so this is all still pending but\nAgain I just want to remind people that right now for the rest of this week um if you give a hundred dollars to alliance defending freedom to help fight for cheese Cochran in for clients just like him who are defending their own religious liberty and defending your religious liberty a few hundred dollars is going to be doubled\nWell before before I answer that I have to follow up when you're a fork in the road you know what they call a cul de sac\nDon't you with us food and the road like that I asked her to get\nA good one that's a good one here\nWe've got all the dad jokes that the end among us by Iran and the other day\nWas ... to joke yeah ... yeah yeah so anyhow so yes I Am doing very well we've had a busy week and uh just got to spend some time on the coast\nThe right coast this time it's been seen some clients that we have over in the south Carolina oh a area and so uh we're always going over there visiting Charleston in Colombia and some of those areas and\nUm it's um some great clients of there and we really enjoy working with those folks over there so we're working throughout the southeast now and um that keeps us kind of busy\nSo yeah but having a good time ...\nAwesome yeah well you know you're talking about today a financial fork in the road what do you mean by that what are we going to be talking about\nWell you know I got to thinking about it and then and you know I there's basically two sets of people when it comes to to retirement planning\nA and and we have to admit the financial services industry is it's confusing you know we've got lots of titles of lots of different people and nobody really knows what half of a mean their agents their advisors era brokers there are a financial sales people that are those planners all these different people\nAnd unfortunately most of those titles you can call yourself without getting any kind of training except the license and and you can have the same license and call yourself pretty much any of those things and and so basically\nWhen we start approach retirement and and I like to kind of shoot between five and ten years before retirement but even the day before retirement [noise]\nUh this is a decision you have to make there's two kinds of people the first kind of person is the person that says\nYou know I've done pretty well myself along the way I've had a little bit of help from a broker it calls me once a year or ... policies occasionally from my age at she helps me out here and there and so you know I think will be fine I've got a few spreadsheets and we're just going to launch into retirement [noise]\nUh and then there's the other person that goes you know the more I look at retirement them more confused I Am\nThe more stuff I see that there is to decide on a you know the more classes I take it by retirement the more I see I have unanswered questions and they begin realizing that it's too important to take the chance a retirement I mean do you get one shot at it and and if\nYou run out of money or screw it up and make a decision that's wrong most of the time you can't reverse it so we're going to talk about that and and we're going to talk more about what ... what the difference is between\nGoing those two forks and the road in which when you take and what a lot of you are taking now and why you should stop it that for and reconsider maybe what you're going to be doing\nWell yeah definitely when you get to that fork in the road you're going to need help making the right decision using the right strategy on the journey and that's where you come in right I mean you you have a lot of different strategies to utilize to help your clients or you know navigate this right\nYeah absolutely and and what I Want to do today part of the show's gonna kind of going through uh the steps that we take with a client to help them further understand why it's so much different than than just going down and investing somebody and and meeting with somebody once or twice a year or whatever\nI think by going through the steps a I think you will help people understand why a retirement roadmap which we call a master plan a is so important and why could make a huge difference\nIn your retirement or not only running out of money but maximizing and then actually of being able to spend freely in retirement perhaps in and then maybe even have any money to leave to to kids and grandkids and things like that so he really is a so critical that that that people understand what we're talking about today and can see the difference\nWell great now where do we start what's the first to tip or a piece of advice you have for us\nWell I'm I've been in the process and maybe you can help me with is Toni may maybe out and I can help us as well of naming other different steps and so the first step is basically when we sit down with folks and we just chat\nIs a time for us to find out everything we can about them and I don't just mean\nWhat what how much do you have in your accounts I mean what are your dreams about retirement what are your uh what do you want to live what do you want to be doing in retirement are you going back to school you're going to write a book are you going to work part time or contract yourself out on a part time basis\nOr you know driving Hoover or are you going to be a welcome person at Walmart I mean these are all things that that you may want to do in retirement simply because it keeps you busy art fulfills or dream or or whatever but but there are so many different things and everybody has a different story\nOr so we spend that entire first meeting just chatting with these folks finding out about their dreams and many times if it's a couple\nThey've never share those dreams with each other you know they can look at each other's uh I never knew you wanted to do this or or whatever and sounds from ... to the fact that I Need the interview myself and my wife is what I needed to uh [laughter] you know their way out on the show that would be trouble right eh\nYeah we'll we'll we'll plan that yeah and we're down the road we'll do that in February thirty seconds or so much ... remind me of that\nI'm so anyhow um uh so and and it is time to also find out more about them financially I don't want to belittle that\nUh but also find out about what their though the accounts they open what did it for what did you open that why did you buy this policy why did you uh openness account just invest but and and things like that and usually it's because of one or two reasons\nEither you know it's because of convenience in other words I went to work for ABC company and they had a four one K. and I can put money away and they'll match in so open this account\nAnd so you know that's a good reason or you know uh that's that's a good reason that before when care for all three of beer or whatever or other times it's because they were sold something you know their their neighbor's son got into the business or they're\nYou know their their cousin or or uncle or brother or whatever you know went to work for an insurance company for for a couple of months and sort of a policy decided he didn't like it and quit most accounts we have that we have a accumulated with\nWe're not really part of a plan they were just kind of part of life\nAnd so we want to find out you know one of the purposes and why did they open them and you know I've got mentioned this in almost every class that Cheech and Everytime I speak in front of a of an audience all asked them\nI'll say who in here has a retirement plan\nAnd about Ninety percent of the hands will go up and I'll say\nI'm so you have a written plan step by step year by year of your cash flow your income your Social Security your tax situation for your retirement years and the hands all go down because when I said retirement plan they thought I met retirement account\nUm most people don't have a plan they have an account or multiple accounts\nAnd felt that is a big difference so that first meeting in and
