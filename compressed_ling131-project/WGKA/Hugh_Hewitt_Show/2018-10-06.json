{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "For cash back every time you shop you guys I bought\nMine just did you see the TV to see what goes on Facebook and Twitter show on TV\nToday on the TV Time machine we will come to me telling him like much new shows Mr Cunningham is an EMT working the night shift in the city of New York risking his life on a nightly basis in order to help save the lives of his fellow citizens\nThe next segment meals on again\nAbout this new jumped to serious chronically these two men and women who make up the DMZ is Bush was among these communities you watch the show which airs on Thursdays to him on the news again for those view in terms of enough to respond to was in an emergency you feel free to license on those ... those are those\nIn the meal think if we're coming on the TV joined us thanks for having me\nNeal you featured in the news don't you series much new shouldn't you here's Thursdays it's in the I'm On a a nice meal chose what night watch nice ... so\nMy watch nation is just pretty much um bring in you know overnight\nIn the primary for the midst of a personal and general or we're going to be just showcasing well we do at night you know ... service in our community and stuff like that those are going to be very interesting I'm just\nPretty much to the U.S bring into mainstream media what we do on a nightly basis or we deal with\nSo specifically what if some of the cases and calls that you will be responding to a night watching action\nPretty much everything that happens in a big city you know from shooting stabbing you know a overdoses which has been a big problem ongoing and I'm just living you know a falls everything they could lead\nTo what is it like working the night watch how different is the city at night and do you prefer working at night\nI Love working and it started out as convenient because of school and everything else uh but then it just ... it became a lifestyle and I started you know I really liked it and I just stuck with working in a very different from the time I say the call that we get at night\nAnd the people that we see at night are very very different from the ones with the in the daytime\nSo when you responding to a medical emergency what is your first priority to the patient when you arrive at the scene will just the first thing that you do\nWell the first thing we do as medical professionals at the shore personal safety um you know ensure personal safety and then you know pretty much the survey see what's going on around the fuse gonna for us\nIt was when I was going on as far as the age of ... and the rest of the quarterly\n[noise] now are there certain common emergency calls that you receive that you kind of get on a regular basis over and over\nAs far as you know you have your regular leg you're you know your local drunk and stuff like that and you'll have like to\nKnow your over those those are more common recently you love your motor vehicle accident you know that's been you know like any city that happens a lot but more so how many like a drug overdoses and you know like there was a little more of a comic all\n[laughter] so is there much down time in the kind of job that you do or is it pretty hectic or the ... pretty constant\nIt depends it depends on the night of the pins and the weather a lot of things come into play and thus far down time go you know we get we get a little you know not here and there and start the night but um it just depends on whether you know on a hot summer night if you're going to be a lot of activity\nAnd you know the weekend with a lot of activity\nFrom time to non stop you every time it was like ... ... for the call but you know ... has a lot to do with the weather is of what's going on in either that or\nDo you get more calls when there was a full moon\n[laughter] believe it or not that has a lot to do with it [laughter] when various places a lot for me [laughter] I've seen that I look up and I'm like oh boy [laughter] so\nWhen you're rushing some of the someone to the hospital how cooperative or drivers moving out of your way and how many people truly understand the rules of the road when it comes to you guys\nI don't know ... you know we're we're not really known for the best drivers\n[laughter] unfortunately\nBut um for the most part it it gets a little bit hectic at times and there's a time when uh they're here like in in the first thing they all of your mind at all beat them for the corner [laughter] we\nHave a driver that try to raise funds but ah who and then you have time and it's a dangerous situation well then you have times when I'm\nYou know you have you do have those drivers that are will knowledgeable and they know to pull over to the ... you know and just get out the way and then you have the ones that are just like completely clueless and they'll stop them before the end up for or a train and come into play because you know we do have like learning to drive a training run that we have to go on a regular basis\nSo when you started as an EMT was there anything about the job that was a surprise to you that you didn't expect\nThat well I Would say one of the things that I realized the\nEverything affects everyone you know what I mean right a cause a lot of times you somebody or things like oh no never that and then you get a call you'd be like oh no you know though it's like I don't think anyone is ... is exempted from certain situations so\nLike the thing is likely ability that I have of something happening to me is that they like to have somebody else or the other thing that I mean right so I I came to realize that you know you can't just look at a person to be like okay I can see that happening now as it happens to anyone at any time you\nKnow your profession is you're describing can be very intense but what is the most challenging aspect of what you do\n\nI Would say people not knowing what we really do in the department that we really serve 'cause a lotta time people they don't they don't understand what you're missing the boat they don't understand the nature of what we do they just think I owe you call it the right to the hospital at cetera\nBut it's a lot more that goes into it a lot that goes into a training and you know whether you're in Europe paramedic you know a paramedic here providing a high level here\nAnd you know pretty much apparently we bring the emergence of the street and we have a lot of capability that a lot of people don't know that so there's some time a little bit of trust issue you know a little bit of conflict with\nThem not you know like are you going to start an easy you know how to be like stuff like that you know ... that's where our expertise coming in and or read the ability to talk of the get them to build trust any patient and you know a little bit above it might be a five minute ride to the hospital but a lot can happen within that timeframe\nSo I Would say that's one of the biggest thing we have but uh didn't we're not watch they come in and it's really going to change the prospect of a lot of people\nWell of course you have a partner her name is aerial what is it like to have aerial is a partner on the night watch\nAn amazing partner I've known her for a while and they were before you have it\nAnd um you know having her as a partner with a real pleasure or we have a lot of fun so don't feel I worked for the most part you know she knows her rule I Know my role and it's almost like chemistry is was perfect then we just flows so it's it's been a real pleasure to see them often partner\nSo how much camaraderie exists among EMT is what is it like to be part of the community\n[noise] it it's a small community it's big but you know what I mean if the ... you know everyone knows everyone and for the most part we look out for each other\nAnd you know they're you know their events that we have\nThat will have come together and you know\nShare experience ... and just you know blow off steam and what is the highest environment that we work in a constant basis though if you know you know for the most part or ... or ... or crazy or you don't ever get to see the same person all the time you know depending on what the thing you're working in but you know we try\nAnd to me where can people find out more about night watch nation on line\nWell watch and they said they visited any website or they could just you know visit my watch and or you can tune in on um Thursday\nAt ten pm that will be here he is every Thursday is that they have to earn a\nMeal it's been a tremendous pleasure having you on the TV Time gene feel free to join us again in the future\nOr in the past ... thanks for

I like to customer service I liked the sound that it actually puts out they do have a lot of different options on their calls also\nHave the basic bottle and I have to you know thirty sounds on it I probably only run maybe ten or twelve of this sounds um I generally will use or maybe forty percent electronic call and sixty percent mouth and hand calls\nA lot of guys get out there and they they buy that automated unit a digital unit and go sit down and they've got that remote control of their hand and\nWell three minutes ago the wounded rabbit didn't work I mean this woodpecker but maybe it's probably not a good idea just to run the gamut through sitting out there are calling just because you didn't see anything real quick with that particular call yeah I mean\nThat yes and no I'm In what you mean by that you don't want to go through you know five six seven eight different sounds ...\nI Will say if you're calling and you're running say a rabbit and you're running of that medium the volume which I recommend not high volume for the price sounds and you sit quiet for a few minutes you try to get nothing comes in 'cause nothing wrong with switching up the sound and you could give a a you know a woodpecker\nOr or some other type of sound maybe set that doesn't work for five or six minutes sick quite a little bit and then go to a great loss distress um but that would be about it I don't like to go through all my sounds that might predator called\nYou know two three maybe for the most through a few houses in there if I'm trying to target coyotes and and that will work but now on the opposite end of the spectrum you know going two or three minutes for the attack are two or three minutes with a rabbit to all you're doing a throne those sounds out and it's a coyote as educated you know you're educating them to all those sounds are now used doing that\nMove a mile down and try different sound you might even call that same coyote and that you didn't call in the first day and\nYou know by just changing locations and coming up with a different sound\nIt's amazing how these critters can hear some believable I mean they can hear 'em and as I said I I actually was out west once and I was daylight calling and I was quiet um I don't call continuously I usually call for three or four minutes I'll sit quiet for two or three\nBut I was on a quiet and I looked up and I saw two guys come up over a beer I arranged them it almost four hundred yards and they were looking around for me they knew I was over there they heard the rabbit prior to that\nThey're just looking around and I just looked at him through my scope and I just went [noise] and they turn their heads and locked in on me I did not do another sign that came down off that view and ran right too many of\nYou know almost four hundred yards away\nSo they they can hear 'em the\nBlasting the sound or sometimes if you give it to loud you turn up to your ... your turn your lecture call on really loud you know especially when you first start out\nIn my opinion is that I think you might be blasting out some of the ... the predators are awful close and you could be smoking then that ordinarily would have came to the call\nI'm calling Turkey's I start with a ...\nYou saw deal really soft and not a whole lot of it because he could be right around the corner it's the same with hunting predators are and then maybe after you've been there twenty thirty minutes he'll turn it up a little louder tried to reach a little further\nYeah absolutely I Will turn it up a little I Try to reach some ears that maybe are just out of the hearing range that I Would ordinarily calling and then I'll run it soft again because they heard that if you turn up louder and they'll start on their way in and then I might stay there another ten or Fifteen minutes give them time to approach\nAs they're getting close to they're going to hear the softer sounds I don't turn it off and leave it up I only turn it up for you know maybe thirty seconds to Manchester reaches and also if I'm using a hand car even electronic call I'll Try to pan my stance sound around so I'll I'll\nCall a little bit for the last call a little bit in front of me call a little bit to the right and now I'm a little bit of the sound behind me so I'll get that sound out in all directions and then I'll turn it down or if I'm using a mouse call it just won't blow quite as hard\nAnd then I'll just kind of relax sit quiet for a little bit\nContinue to call it a softer here softer tone\nWatch visit with the dog wants to talk to those dogs a little bit when you're not usually got a wind and a rabbit or quarter sound outside of a cow but you want to talk to the coyotes are themselves a how or a bar or whatever tell me how you're

home here in this Chris as possible you can't make a coyote vocalization as loud as a a a coyote can actually do it so you have enough they're close and you do or how he will not spoke them okay\nSo there's no way that you can make 'em a coyote pop distress or coyote how too loud but you gotta watch on some of the electronic call to return 'em up to doubt that makes a crackling sound as not as Chris she got to make sure it's nice clean Chris sound\nBut I'll do two or three ... for a little bit maybe I'll do another two or three house on on a mile call so it sounds like two different coyotes set a little bit and wait and if I hear any response as if I didn't hear response um and might be a challenge response I'll challenge that coyote back and it's important to know\nNobody knows all the coyote vocalizations what that what they mean but we know a few of them we know the warning barks we understand the ah I'm challenged parks in the house we understand the loan somehow so there's a few

with you and fight for your shooting and hunting heritage and every day of the year in Washington DC we're the Dallas safari club on executive director gory Mason inviting you to learn more at big game dot org\nMy campaign House yesterday Joseph who though has been predator hunting for more than forty years\nYeah I started when I was around fourteen years old I'm you know I had the big old battery pack and actually I'm would take out a car battery or my dad would take me out into the foreign field and take a car better with alligator clips and the bagel spotlight and then we would put red cellophane over the spotlight to change the color red\nAnd then I'll be sitting there you know he would drive off you know to you know back to the farmhouse or just a over the hill and wait for me and I'd be sitting there I'm In a calling\nAnd I'd be trying to scan with one hand with the spotlight\nAnd then when a ... at that time we didn't have any chi's here in Pennsylvania so when the Fox will get close I Would try to balance the shot gun on the spotlight and try to shoot at the same time a little fourteen year old trying to do that was quite tough and I never forget the first grade Fox I called in and out as a sitting down and um after I shot I was on my back\nI had to get back up get my witness bombing and I had to go over there and look about thirty are out there and there was a a Pennsylvania grave thoughts laying there I was just so excited I mean at that point I was hooked\nAnd you know I've been hunting ever since I'm On and off to college and stuff but it got really serious here about Eighteen or Nineteen years ago where I was a um really are doing a lot more calling\nAnd are starting to target the ah the coyotes at that point the technology\nHas advanced so I'm for metal battery out of dads truck and at a at a big spotlight but it had not advanced far enough for Joe pseudo and you decided to come up with your own lighting system particularly built for calling critters\nYeah um my lighting system is is actually designed for my style of hunting I'm back in two thousand twelve you know I was still heavily into hunting and I knew that there is other lights out there and other kinds of lighting technology but it just more advancing towards a predator\nUm aspect of it so I just took it upon myself to get a hold of a lighting company to design a light undermines specifications for predator hunting and we came up with a heavy lamp commentary ... a very very small it's only a slow over six ounces with the battery or you can get nine hours run time on on one\nCharge which is basically all night long\nAnd you can adjust the brightness for different men phases so you know you can\nGo to the whole ten percent up to a hundred percent or anywhere in between and you'll get all night on one charge and then we advance to a gun like a very small six their first got it was only some six inches long and seven houses with the battery a remote a U.S\nOff and on switch that is completely silent I mean you can be three inches from it you will not hearing the clicking has an advantage says you get a coyote that runs in quickly and he stopped at twenty yards you don't want to have\nAny clicking sound that scare that coyote away so you know we we put a lot of thought in our license from there we've advanced quite a bit\nJust on customer suggestions you know they want it to a brighter light we made a three hundred yard gun light then we also came up with a dull headband her a headlight withdrawal colors so we have the red or green for hunting and then you can push a button and you go right to white\nAnd you can adjust to brightness on the white you can adjust to brightness on the red independently so if you shoot an animal at night and you wound up when you're looking for blood push of a button he got white light you can do your tracking we have found that our lights of advanced um we've had such um versatile lights\nThat we'd get them for everything for night fisherman by one guy's professional night crawl or um he he gets a earthworms he loves life because he can adjust to read way down it doesn't scare the earthworms\nTo people who frog at night snowmobile as we have a one headlights that is so bright that it's actually broader than a high being a pickup truck and it's only ten and a half ounces and it's rechargeable and you get up to eighty hours wrong time just on one charge and adjustable brightness but that will builders are using that\nYou know a mushers in Alaska are using it mushing dogs um you know it just so versatile that can hunters we actually designed it can hunting but um it's just kind of a you know grow into other aspects of life that where you need lighting at night on your head\nHey let's talk about a solo hunting at night or whether or not eyes likes a for a predators coyotes bobcats Fox has a and hunting with a partner there are some big differences there what do you prefer to\nHighlight going with a partner and it's just because I can share the exciting unless somebody and and you know but there are times where all ...\nUm and I know a lot of hunters that's all they do is Han Solo so you know\nHeat or I don't know if one is better than the other but there are some differences you know how you're going to set up and such but you know light discipline is always important especially when you have to hunters because you're going to have two sets of scan lights out there and ah you know you've got to be careful and you also have to be mindful of or your partner is if you're not sitting together I like to sit together\nBut if you get a running ... he's swinging on you and your partner is out there in the dark you have to be careful about that yeah I guess you're sitting back to back\nYeah absolutely um I like and and there's a ... role but most of the time I'm Will sit back to back we'll go out will know the area ahead of time so we'll we'll set up in an open area will set back to back\nTo cover a hundred and eighty I'll cover a hundred and eighty and will constantly continue to scan and call ... close to us or I use a mouse call because we want that predator as he's approaching to be looking at\nUs unlike in the daylight when you are looking away from you\nAnd now you I'm looking at you say you can see the reflection once you catch the eyes one of us will squeak [noise] the other person will automatically turn their scan laid off so they don't back\nLike um the shooter and I'm going to call that predator enough is happens to swing over to the other person that's set up with us he can obviously always turn his can light on her as gun light on and make the shot so\nUm I tried to do that when I'm On the other partner I'll Try to let my partner always make the shot so that kind of it's coming and directly in front of me\nHe can turn to scam right off and he can get it up beside me remember that wall of light of camouflage that so they can't see anything are concealment they can't see anything so your partner as long as his life not on can come up beside you and then when the animal gets close not taken activated got might make the shot\nReally important to communicate with your partner if you're ... you know just starting to hunt with each other at night after a while it's like a hand in glove and you know what you're doing but\nUh when you first start out obviously important to recognize before you get out of the pick up that hey if I've got one coming into me I'm just going to squeak a little bit with my mouth and that's your cue to turn around and get rid\nYeah absolutely and and we use is even we're walking into a stand that squeaking does two things at one of the predator that there might be a mass for something to get him to train\nLooking at you so you can use your scan light it you know again they can't see it as long as that scan lights on it but it also let your partner note that you see something I Can't tell you how many times I walked into a stand before we got set up\nAnd then I Would uh I'm usually the first one block and so I'm constantly using my scan like going across and if I see a set of eyes I just like that that my partner automatically nose\nTo either stop and turn it scanned laid off he has his on or just stop and not move\nAnd then we'll mealy then set up to see if it's a predator if it is we'll just go down to our knees put our shooting sex up and call that predator right in right where we are set up right at the spot that we first Sam what right do you prefer to carry her bar mitzvah and what lows kept on going to hunt\nAnd Fox at the same time which I'm not sure which one is going to be coming in I Will use the Seventeen Hornet a which is a center of fire\nAnd I prefer the twenty five grand hall point I tried to twenty grain V. max and I've had too many runners shine runner is where you actually make a good shot but the predator just runs often and you just can't find him and he died somewhere other than the um and able to make a recovery but I can tell you after switching to the twenty five grand hall point\nI'm Seventeen Hornet\nPolar recoveries I have a I have not lost any so far so\nI'm very satisfied with that not that it can happen even with the bigger caliber way of what we found that that's that's the best caliber and now the now so I'm going to hunt\nKind of specific lights um you know all these are two twenty three and there's some times where we were not going to hunting Fox will use it to twenty three it's a little more a little more gun a little bit more power a little bit more range so um you know I'll use that\nBut if I'm hunting box I don't like the two twenty three tears up the ... and I like to you know I like to say that for I don't like to waste anything so yeah\nAbsolutely a Bob cats\nBut cats I'm I'll use either two twenty three is Seventeen Hornet one seat on um I I'm just thinking when you asked me that I've probably a seven times out of ten I'd probably grab the Seventeen Hornet\nYou have hunted a coyotes bobcats critters uh from New York state all the way to New Mexico Texas Nebraska\nCanada all over and there's a vast different it's not just the ... couch ... there's a vast difference in our coach crosses\nCounter yeah there's approximately the might even be more but uh the professionals have said that there are so at least eight different subspecies coyotes out there I mean when you're down in the southern part you know you're going to have Kaiser little smaller than a little more brazen or they'll come in a little quicker they're a little less lay shot when you go up to the north east [noise]\nAh Pennsylvania Ohio and your candidate that the uh\nThe Kaiser going to be um bread with a little bit of gray wolf I'm so they'll have a little bit more light shy there are a little bit more wary and they're larger they're bigger coyotes\nAnd then you go out west and you'll have really pretty ah sand he'll coyotes out there they're not as as shy as as a northeastern north eastern coyotes um his without question in my opinion are\nThe most difficult ... to call and um there's a lot of timber you don't have the open plains um and they're just a difficult ... uh they seem more wary I'm not saying they're more intelligent but they they are more aware and more light shy\nAnd just call shy shy treat every ... no matter where I should have the trophy but when you get one up here it is without question uh um\nUh something to be proud of because they're very difficult to call and I mean I can call you know I've been on a brass can we've called in ten eleven twelve ... and the day he try that up here in Pennsylvania especially daylight hunting you might you might get one\nOr you were telling me particularly about the sandhill coyote and we talked about sand hills that's some folder western Nebraska and what a beautiful coke and a lot about you fear that\nValue is sometimes triple a what they will ... in the I'm In Pennsylvania where the northeast here um I Know last year I had a couple of that I shot out there and I was offered sixty dollars a piece for them on the carcass and you wouldn't get sixty dollars even for one that's put up here and you know in our part of the country so\nThat the ... are different even within Nebraska yeah the pills are different so the sandhill ... so it seems to be the most sought after\nYeah and uh you know Texans we like to brag and we can be proud of the stuff and we're proud of our bobcats down there

said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this case is even weaker than that\nThis is from Rachel Mitchell Pape a prosecutor of sex crimes tucked the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate though\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee member nor do I believe is evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence then to understand the difference folks\nThere there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt but outside of the legal world all you need is the ... I think in the ... from mistaken in civil suits\nThe preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just for ... but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\nThe Republicans seem to show absolutely fairness of the accuser and giving deference wavering members in his own caucus delayed the confirmation one vote\nWeek the FBI made it official inquiries\nMid week I spoke with the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice\n[noise] now if in fact we get word that the FBI has done and that should all centers will have the report it's okay to file the notion of culture because that's just thirty hours of debate people will have plenty of time to read the report\nThat's right under the Senate rules are there will be at least a an intervening day or the other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cloture vote wouldn't be until the following day so there'll be plenty of time for senators to read the FBI's a supplemental background investigation\nYou know senator I represented the victim of the sexual assault on a major college campus I catch a more because of confidentiality I'm very sympathetic to victims because the institution of America has not yet adopted to deal with these but that they're changing nevertheless I'm a lawyer like you and I know one\nThe fear of flying there that that was given to the committee that simply wasn't true it wasn't given by her I was getting by the lawyers her ex boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she has a millionaire with polygraphs inconsistent with their testimony testimony and this is a lawyer deal\nCould not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one that could be disproven that's very rare and then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there are problems whether testimony\nWell there are some allies of oil a ritual Mitchell uh was retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um and I thought that are very professional job\nBut I thought she got the basic facts out demonstrated that there are gaps I understand the victims of of trauma can have memory lapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after thirty five years but I just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that uncorroborated\nAllegations should be enough to condemn or a nominee\nSo let's go to the last issue which is Jerry now learn the incoming chairman of the house Judiciary Committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays he will hold each month proceedings I say bring those on cars they will be laughing stocks about Seventy rule I just got into it she said Brett Kavanaugh why I said he absolutely did not lie about drinking did not lie about devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a senator\nWell I think it's this has gotten a a ridiculous absurd we're talking about in prison as high school yearbook whether he threw ice on somebody at some point in the past um I think they've been unsuccessful and attacking the judges credibility\nAnd feel like a now they're all from this wild goose chase and uh the goalposts as five friend the majority leader who likes to say uh after continued to move a but it's time to vote\nHere's what Lindsey Graham said on Fox News last night cut number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats I think they're toast\nAll of them all up all of them\nPolitically and if I didn't know the only thing\nThat are open seemingly ... even though there is no\nSenator Cornyn Joni Ernst agreed with that do you agree with that\nI I agree uh because I think I'm In these red states that President Trump carried a I think that uh I think the judicial I mean I'm Sorry I'm just I think the Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are are confirming what are the ones who just said\nAs the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to\nA duck Cory Gardner who's the chairman this year as a as ... as basically confirmed\nThat you know I think things very big is going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the visceral rejection of McCarthyism directed at\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because if they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw this at them and judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry what do you think's into a corner\nI don't blame him for being angry and this this ridiculous\nAllegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or heard not display the appropriate temperament on the bench this man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nOr there were a couple of times where I think well one time in particular where he asked judge or to their corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut he shouldn't be expected just to take a business slander these allegations of\nCriminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position who feels like they've been falsely accused I think would be angry and be justified in showing some of that anger\nLast question senator I I Know that some people might be a ... some good shape because of the FBI report not to vote for um judge Kaplan I I think it will be a huge mistake unless they're direct corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican doesn't support him\nHis or her career done as a Republican I've never seen the base this way is that the general sense in the cockpit\nI think you'll see overwhelming support in the caucus for\nUh for the judge and the middle of this political debacle another letter blurred at they went from the president of the American bar association Robert Carlson says my sale it'll colleague Larry Elder you ever read that letter that the president\nOf the ab a sense urging the Senate Judiciary committee to hold off voting on\nJudge Kavanaugh until there's an FBI investigation and let it was written by the president of the ... name of Robert crossing turns out Robert ... that I have permission from the standing committee to send that letter and they're unhappy that he sent it without their permission and they're unhappy that people are suggesting that the NBA has withdrawn its support of Brett Kavanaugh they have not\nHad his part Scott Brown from one of the points you made as he said look I Want to use these tariffs has a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with the topic but what is it working 'cause these countries are reducing their cherished\nEven a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries\nAnd the University of Chicago survey of top economists found Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off with NAFTA than the previous previous so when President Trump keeps calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI did you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped draft now they're back in Nineteen Ninety two or three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved this with the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement is now called the U. S. M. C. A. we're not going to call now any longer but it is a new on North American trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries\nIs modernized because America has a better deal and so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing a minimum wage on other countries should right and that's one of the things I don't like about this the also very it got me on that one that's not you know we we won Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics and this plan show I'm going to agree with you on that\nOne and so on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for the candidate has imposed against us and militaries and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nNot just in just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of
