I think that they're waiting I think that what the Democrats are kind of hoping for some sort of a a you know an\nArmed or some sort of violence at the border that they can try to show in a negative light\nOr that's the only thing I can think of well I heard there may know that there is no way we'll let all these people and they're\nHoping for that and this is the this is not George Soros personally\nBut it is his open society foundation that's giving money to all these other agencies that are using this odd to ah support these people and in some cases are actually given money I mean whatever the case may be a do you get 'em up here because they've been promised all sorts of things once they get here\nWell I was like ... or ... again I'm sad to Central America a lot of ... ... ... even Venezuela they're throwing ... look at it do something like this you know start off by putting all their other talk back\nTo Nineteen eighty when Castro opened up the prisons and you know a mental institutions in just a lot always be an example of how much of the United states which was a big you're kind of caught the orders and more cause a bit of a match here so similar type of a situation right\nNow let's talk about what the president and she just in here and of course it's just a a suggestion or we're not sure how are we going to do this but he said in his speech again he said I Would like to uh put any ten percent middle income tax cuts\nAre probably right after the elections or maybe the first one was before now it's after\nI get I don't I don't have the ... he's planning on doing and I have some sort of ... percent middle income right or maybe Richard X. rayed at that level I don't know um I don't know but I but I Do know I ...

I'm Sorry eastern time and the third our the program got used to that part of things\nUh my friend Peter ... United States civil rights commissioner will be joining us to talk about the caravan and the galaxy there of\nAnd also in the south or an hour of the program this morning we will hear from ah RJ home and he's the director of government relations for fair\nThat's an important organization you probably are very aware of\nAs a loyal listener of the Hugh Hewitt show\nUh the federation of Americans for immigration reform it is an extraordinarily important organization that really has their finger on the pulse of what's going on with respect to the ... now the caravan is the lead story of the morning without question and a and that includes last night's massive rally in Texas for Ted Cruz\nAre held by the president of the United states did you see\nNot just how many people were there but there was ongoing coverage throughout the day yesterday on Fox News and other places of the thousands and thousands of people who waited in line overnight some for twenty four maybe even pushing up to thirty\nSix hours to get in to hear the president in Texas a rallying for Ted Cruz last night and by the way what do you know what a strange strange sight to see you know it was only two short years ago maybe two and a half a little\nBit I guess when you go back to the summer of twenty sixteen and the primary season and the uh in the spring of or excuse me some are twenty fifty and then the primary season in the spring of twenty sixteen when\nDonald Trump and Ted Cruz we're not exactly sharing stages together in warm embrace a lying to head a calls and\nAccusations of you know National Enquirer stories about a a Ted Cruz's father related to JFK and and ... you know these\nAre all of these kinds of strange things but I'll tell you what nothing like two years of Democrat insanity to bring former political rivals together in common cause\nAnd at the end of the day that's what this is that's what this was the president of the United states last night rally in for and he's done this with others to\nYou know President Trump and Lindsey Graham didn't always get along very closely as you know Lindsey Graham was more closely aligned with one of President Trump's fiercest critics the late John McCain\nBut it's amazing what the Democrats can do for Republican unity and unification simply by being well very democratic and now that's wrong way say but being very Democrat\nAnd that's essentially what has happened last night so the president of the United states last night a rallying for Ted Cruz and they came out by the thousands and thousands of people seem to at least say people the media\nThe media the left Democrats whatever you want to call them and kind of it's kind of all one in the same those are all synonymous with one another the media and the Democrats and the left are literally all synonymous with one another they want to say that these are Trump crowds are overblown\nThey tell you this rock Obama held a rally in California a short while ago filled with about three million just to just the the area and the county he was in about three million very very blue voters it's a very blue districts hit seven hundred and fifty people come out to sea of\nPresident Trump has tens of thousands at all of these rallies there were always overflow crowds outside they're setting up big TV monitors\nYou know big screens for them to watch from the outside they just want to be a part of it and the reason why isn't just enthusiasm for what President Trump stands for\nIncluding his very strong statements yesterday about um about the caravan and about migrants that about securing our border and so on and so forth it's not they're not just rallying for what the president is preaching now what the president President is is I'm advocating\nIt's rallying against the tactics of the left rallying against the bullying rallying against the intimidation rallying against the harassment rallying against the physical battery and assault in some cases\nRoute rallying against um you know the media calling for these things rallying against the left a laughing when Republicans are treated in such ways\nI Know you played this yesterday that Bush and all he played a lot or yellowish yesterday and I'm surprised you didn't play the whole show an audio form because this voice was so bad and get well soon hopefully you are ah hopefully not listening right now you should be sleeping after a night in Pittsburgh God Bless ya\nUh but you should be sleeping but a Phillip range of course former Obama a deputy ... deputy assistant secretary of state\nUh on on MSNBC that essentially mocking Mitch McConnell who was being harassed in a restaurant the way Sarah Sanders has been harassed and restaurants the way so many others have just been attacked\nOr just for being Republicans just by rabid liberal protestors who listen to their masters\nOn national television online they listen to note that while they can listen to their own um there are no Democrats elected positions or other well respected positions of authority calling for an end to the harassment and intimidation\nThere no no one is calling for an end to this\nHave you heard Nancy Pelosi have you heard Chuck Schumer the two ranking members of Congress but the Democrats have you heard any of the more popular\nOr Democrats or who are kind of in the news you know the Elizabeth Warren's the Cory bookers the Kamala Harris says have you heard any of them denouncing Maxine Waters and those who would call for more violence intimidation and harassment of Republicans no\nThey're not saying anything former President Obama who is still revered by the left\nIs he's speaking out and saying no stop this this is not what it's about we don't win in the streets by by uh intimidating harassing and and and quite frankly battering people in certain circumstances we don't win that way we went up the ballot box no\nNone of them are saying this instead they're on television law allowing the media and people like Philip brains using the media to call for more of this and guess what it has done\nIs this rally those thousands of people to all of these places where the president is holding rallies\nOther thousands the you know they can all get in just starting to seats and yet they're willing\nTo sit outside for twenty four hours there were thirty six hours they're ill getting like there were at a at a football game just on the chance that they can get in and if they can't get in then they'll cheer from the outside of the venue like they did last night last night down in Houston\nThat's that's not just pro Trump that's rebelling against the insanity of the left that's rebelling against the coals for violence and the lack of calls\nFor civility that's what's happening so the president of the United states really found a tremendous you know has found really a tremendous rallying cry\nYou know and and that is against what the Democrats he latched on to something I Know he didn't coin it but a lot of people are truly brought into play and the president seems to have him braced it and that is jobs not mobs Democrats if you vote Democrat it brings you mobs if you vote Republican\nThe president has taken a saying now that brings you jobs\nAnd he's a hundred percent right over four million jobs created since he took over and of course the lowest unemployment rate we've seen in this country in nearly what five decades literally five decades I Want to say goes back to Nineteen sixty not\nUh the lowest unemployment rate and of course the lowest all time unemployment rate for so many of those subgroups including African Americans Latino Americans are women and youth\nIn terms of unemployment rates so you bring your what do you want jobs are mobs and I think people are responding they're coming out to see the president they're coming out to listen they're coming out to hear him rally not only for his policies and for you know a continuation of the tax cuts and the things that have a you know that a sport our economic growth to the level that it has\nBut also for those members of Congress that need a little bit of a boost to make sure that we maintain the majority in both houses and also for those who are running\nTo keep control but he would be ... you know he would be bucking political history\nIn the same way that he bucked it when he won the office of president in the first place it would just be an amazing thing\nBut at any rate the president last night obviously are spending a great deal of time talking about votes and voters in the United states and tying\nIt to the caravan why and how quite simply because the Democrats are trying to import more voters by way of ...\nHe says we're going to stop it and he says we will have nothing [noise] so we will not used to stop that terrorists\nWere to talk more about that as we continue this morning ... in Cleveland, Ohio sitting in the great view if you if you're on the show

senior political writer for Washington the Washington Examiner CNN political ... an analyst as well\nDavid on line at David M drunk or follow him at David M drunk or David morning how are you\nI'm good how are you a fantastic thanks for the times of the press you know it's funny I started to show this morning\nTalking about it just seems like yesterday the president was calling Ted Cruz lie in bed and suggesting or\nA you know the national Enquirer suggesting that his father was complicit in the murder of JFK and all of these other things and it's amazing what a little bit of a democratic extremism can do to bring a political rivals together and last night they were embracing one another as if they were long lost\nFriends do you see that kind of unity happening just a you know on an on an individual or an anecdotal scale or is this widespread Republicans were all coming together to combat what they see is democratic extreme as\nI don't know if I put it that way I think that you have a lot of Republicans that were at odds with President Trump only sixteen and understand where their voters our number one ... voters like President Trump so arguing or being at arm's length President Trump you're running for reelection in a midterm election where you use\nRepublican base turnout to begin with a ... that's not going to work\nOr you know number number two\nI'm the president has been helpful in in firing up the Republican base and especially the way politics has become so incensed Balkan eyes um and they're just there's not a lot of currency out there for um\nFor running a winning an election especially in a red state like Texas and I could you know we could take off a list of red states where there are additive Senate races are potentially competitive Senate races it just doesn't do any good to 'em\nRun away from Trump so if you if you want to make sure you get the turnout that you're going to need and if you want to make sure you're gonna get turn it you're going to campaign with the president and you're going to make nice with him and I think it's just it's as simple as that\nYou know David I'm director is our guest a Bob brand sitting in for here is that it's not so much just the the campaigning with the president and and being aligned with the president\nIs being United against the Democrats I feel like the Kavanaugh episode of this as late summer slashed ball or along with this caravan episode now\nIt is it is driving a lot more unity among Republicans because they feel like the Democrats have just become so extreme and are basically resorting to any measures necessary to try to stop President Trump I feel like more than rallying for president it's rallying against that Democrat push and that's what they're trying to do\nWell so I think that if if you will get correct look I think they're trying to use those two episodes we know that have a lot of impact on that race as we know Canada is that an impact on some house races and you know on the territory where you have\nSolid Republican territory where Republican voters in this league aged or maybe place it that's what happens when you call Washington and roll the White House in a midterm year I think having a kind of served to re engage Republicans and sort of wake up\nThe conservative base and and so I think that's a big part of it I I just think that when you're when you're looking at a Republican like Ted Cruz\nWho had previously battle with the president and they didn't always get along and there are a number of Republicans in that oh look at senator Dean Heller in Nevada and then the calculation wasn't so much gee these Democrats really scare me I'm I'm going to be with Trump calculation was\nThat I'm going to be with Trump because that's going to help me win because that's where my voters are and because fighting with a Republican president if I'm a Republican isn't going to do me any good\nThe situation that I mean I think with Kavanaugh and some of these other issues have done\nA native little bit easier to unite with Trump policy perspective because it has lived in the background maybe some of those issues that were problematic about Trump in some states but I don't I Would contend in a state like you know and a senior Arizona Texas\nA North Dakota and Missouri now the best place you could have been all along is probably with President Trump\nDavid I'm drunk or is our guest a this morning on the Hugh Hewitt program so the the ... let's talk about why people want to align with the president the president that it was supposed to be so unpopular the latest poll I think it was just yesterday NBC Washington are are are not a washing the wall Street Journal poll\nShows him at forty seven percent which is peak which is pretty amazing thing and when you compare it to President Obama going into his first midterm in twenty than he was that around forty five forty six if I saw those numbers correctly yesterday\nHow do you explain that given the and I think you've seen the same surveys done by the media Research Council and others that Ninety two percent of the press coverage for the president this entire summer has been negative Ninety two percent of stories including the Trump had been negative yet he's up there at forty seven percent I'd be explained that\nRepublican voters just don't pay attention to news stories that in that regard I mean I I don't think it matters to Republican voter what are right or what anybody in the media\n\nMorning glory America ... I'm not there so there's a dog that's what happens when you go to Pittsburgh I'm sure Bob plans will understand that he's sitting in for me today\nFrom beautiful ... every it's like when I go to Cleveland but Bob is doing premise because if he got mine veteran Mayfield early if you hadn't been such a Sam Darnell family wouldn't be two for one right now\nBob for that but if you can turn around and get the set it back in ... and make sure that stays under control and Kevin McCarthy\nAll will be forgiven time from off your job thank you Robert [noise]\n\nBest to you doing my best to do my job in the face of incessant trolling from the host of the show who isn't actually hear my goodness gracious [noise] uh the\nBaker Mayfield story a thanks for joining us pop ranch joining indeed from Cleveland, Ohio my home base the pain free really factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer thank you so much for joining us to start your day great conversation with David I'm drunk or I went out of time before I could ask him\nA question about the caravan and it's pretty obvious question and that is\nHow we use it and why is it that no Democrat politicians have spoken out against care not one not one I mean quite literally no one is saying whoa whoa whoa whoa\nThere started with two thousand and it's not what the seven thousand and by the time they reverse the one thousand miles they still have to go to get to the southern border of the United states it'll probably go ten twelve Fifteen thousand whoa whoa whoa whoa we can't just take all of these people in\nWe can't just you know a release all of these thousands of people into the into the fabric of the continental United States of America on a wink and a nod promise that they'll come back for an actual am to earn a asylum hearing at some point we can't do that and also why is that why is the overwhelming majority\nOf these individuals who are in this caravan why are the men of working age because there aren't a ton of families according to those reporting from a you know that caravan\nTheir families it's mostly males of working age that are coming here are these people are really\nSeeking asylum is really something that terrible going on in the middle eastern Asia or Middle Eastern rather Central American nations although the president pointed out there are people from the middle east who have joined in as well\nRemember our southern border is essentially a revolving door for people to come into the United states from not just Mexico or from Central America but quite frankly from all over the world\nBecause these other countries are not taking their sovereignty as seriously as we uh we would like to hear but anyway\nAlthough the Central American migrants are few things really so bad in their countries that they need to seek asylum from persecution and fear that they face in their own countries is that really what this is about is this really humanitarian issue where these people are being persecuted and they cannot\nYou know they they cannot stay in their own countries without dieting\nWell let's put that to the test for a moment we'll give it a little credit to Fox News here and do a one of my listeners at my local show in Cleveland ah for sharing this with me this was a Fox News report from Sunday\nAnd I'm\nQuestions by the reporter here from Fox News of a member of the caravan I think are extraordinarily revealing well the questions but moreover the answers are extraordinarily revealing I Want you to listen very carefully to what is really going on in this caravan of quote unquote migrants\nThat many of us believe are actually more like invaders trying to circumvent us immigration law please give us all\nAs I can see as far as the eye can see I can see on during the immigrants headed north to the bus into Honduras they went through about a mile and now they're trying to tackle Mexico right now they are north of that river\nNorth of the bridge you saw people on yesterday so last night people got frustrated found a bridge Mexico's process about six hundred and forty people get a visa for potentially asylum here could they vote if I Do Ninety Days people got for us if they weren't worth is a last night in\nAcross the river swimming came in droves I\nHad to see maybe two hundred immigrants last night maybe in a thirty minute time processing the river coming here and now you see them now say they're going to be as a caravan me claim and they're on their way to a town called ... there were about we're right now about twenty miles north of that river\nGoing ... right now some of the people here you can see they're taking a break they've got some shade here they're getting something great guy will be joined now by one of the members of the a caravan his name is Louis here from Honduras tell me what are these people going why are they doing\nWe're going to talk about so much effort\nOur people wanting to go to the border of United States then we come they\nOver here because um [noise] a situation in our country is going back\nOh let me ask you this so as you know\nThe un ac ours here un high commissioner rub you refugees actually brought them in to try to help processing now the standard that they're going to use as unless you're a victim of reform have a credible fear of persecution sort of raise nationality religion or political views don't qualify for asylum so what are these people going to say when they get the United states\nAs they they gave them something that they can if they are the United states and they can go to school or they get an apartment and they can go to work as you know President Trump is that's it\nThat's it\nThat's what you needed to hear and I hope you understood what you just heard you cannot claim asylum in the United states\nUnless you are fleeing persecution on the basis of race or religion or sexual orientation et cetera he ran down the reporter ran down the things that you can claim asylum or you're being persecuted in your country so what is that he asked this ... this caravan remember that you're going to say when you get up there and he said basically we're coming to pick your jobs\nYou heard him\nWere coming to take advantage of your educational system are going to put our kids in your schools and we're going to take your jobs he said we want to go there and we want to work and then what are you going to do with that money by the way are you going to spend it in the United states lost at least helping to contribute to the United states economy\nAnd he's not going to let people in Mexico said they're not going to let these people pass I Will tell you aren't though earlier today we saw about two hundred wire police were going to stop them on this highway ... pulled back they retreated I don't think they want a confrontation but the point is held as who said he's not going to let people when you guys\nSaid at last I last left our man we we have over there but he went and bought or sold them\nThere's a change though as you know that Mexico in the United states is supposed to reach a third party saved agreement unless you qualifier tubing request asylum in Mexico we're not going to the United states is not going to let you and that's gonna be the reason for denial\nThey send the back of our country when\nAnd that's what it is that's one\nOf the if they send us back we're going to turn around and come back again\nSo he says we are going to come here we want to take jobs and we're going to take money and we're going to send it back to support our family's back there this is why it's the vast majority of the members of this caravan are like I said working age males\nBecause they're gonna come to the United states to work they're not fleeing persecution for the race in Honduras they're not fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation they're not fleeing persecution because of their ah of their uh ethnicity they're not fleeing persecution because of a of any reason whatsoever\nThey are coming to the United states because their nation\nCan't get them work and so they're coming to take jobs for people in another country and they're not going to repatriate those dollars back to their own country they don't want to come to the United states to be American\nHow do we know this\nBecause they're not walking under the American flag they're walking behind a massive street wits banner of the Hondurans live and then they're flying Honduran flags over themselves as they march\nIf a group of seven thousand people tries to ever another country flying their own flag that is not a migration that is an invasion\nThey don't want to abandon the nation that has essentially made their lives unlivable in their minds they want to move that nation north into a better nation but\nNot swear allegiance to that new nation one would think that it might be more beneficial for these people to be flying an American flag over their heads saying we love America we want the American dream instead they're flying the Honduran flag saying we have a right to come here and still be Honduras we're bringing Honduras nor\nThrough Guatemala\nThrough Mexico and into the United states and you can't stop us and if you try to we will turn around and come back again by the way the president of lettuce and last time he's going to have to let us in this time to\nNot the president of the United states last night speaking in Texas said this rally for Ted Cruz said really not so much I don't have to do that and I'm not going to do that and\nHe previously vowed to send the military as opposed to the national guard to confront this group which the un now says is over Seventy two hundred members strongest started\nWith

this not mocking Lee I said this legitimately because the president of the United states does have this power I mentioned this and our number one of the broadcast this morning and I want you to again take this with you and share this information with those who may not understand it\nThe president doesn't need congressional approval to stop this because the president already has congressional approval to stop this it wasn't given the Donald Trump the man\nThis was passed in Nineteen fifty two\nSection to twelve step of the immigration and nationality nationality act reads\nWhenever the president signs that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens and I'm gonna pause there to say this but just the difference between aliens in class of aliens is different or there is a difference because just aliens could mean\nA immigrants trying to come to the United states legally or illegally but literally trying to immigrate to the United states that's different from those seeking refuge in the United states or seeking asylum in the United states there are different classes of people who want to come to the United states\nAnd that's why the language of this law passed by Congress in Nineteen fifty two is so important\nOne of the president finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens in to the United states would be detrimental to the interests of the United states he made by proclamation\nAnd for such period as he deems shall deem necessary\nSuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or not immigrants again meaning

freaking people out\nBy by suggesting that the Trump Administration is trying to to make trans gender people non existent then was literally in the headline\nTrans people will be nonexistent in if Trump Trump gets his way in essentially what it what it means is that the Trump Administration as the New York times tries to uh you know a ... you know over play this and use hyperbole is simply using science\nAnd trying to define that there are two genders there are ... X chromosomes in their X Y chromosome individuals it's there is no third option there is no combination better off there is no one who has both able to become pregnant and to impregnates another\nThat doesn't happen there are just two genders there are males and females their execs and there is that's why that is not trying to define transgender out of existence\nBut what it is trying to do is protect people from trying to protect 'em you know women for example from being redefined out of existence by this ridiculous movement\nSo the president simply is is you know stating what everybody knows this is called science it's amazing how much the left clings to science when it comes to things like climate change and they tell anybody who doesn't buy into man made climate change that they're anti science even though there is a lot of sites that says\nClimate change is not caused by man\nBut when it comes to something that that is completely immutable such as chromosomal biology human biology and ... that's why they don't recognize that science\nIs simply staggering but the New York times is freaking people out transgender could be defined out of existence under the under the Trump administration's just another example of the media carrying the water for the left and the radical agenda\nUh let me go to a Georgia next and this is going to be Richard you're up let's move on to Columbus ohio Donna you're on the Hugh Hewitt showdown and thanks for joining us go right ahead\nMemorial um I like going back to you about a a cat and coming out and hunt or\nDown yes of course of course please\nOkay I think our military has gotten better loyal all it's all up and it is horrible that they are they all get along\nAnd in light it's cheap\nIt's like you said they can't get Marshalls here expect that I'm going to have the ...

C. much of the time where he serves as the United states commissioner on civil rights Peter good morning how are you sir\nI'm doing great\nI'm Glad we're able to make this connection and a\n... I Want to play something for you very quickly this was a part of a Fox News report um from Mexico or just on the northern side of a ... with a Guatemala and I'm\nA reporter is talking to one of them one of the migrants are one of the invaders depending on your point of view and saying you you can't claim asylum in the United states unless you are claiming persecution by your home countries government on the basis of one of of several things and those would be race religion nationality\nPolitical opinion or social group so if you can't credibly claim one of those things what is that that you're going to say when you get there and he was the response\nAs they they gave him something so they can't say I have and they can't they can't go to school so they can't apartments and they can go to work as\nSo it's ... it's it's as plain as as the nose on your face they're saying essentially we don't have a claim to asylum we just want to go there and go to work we want to go there and take American Jobs\nAway from American citizens or from illegal immigrants legal residents in the United states and then we're going to repatriate the money back to our own country that we can't stand because we're leaving but were flying the flag 'cause we march northward anyway\nThat this is not about asylum there is no persecution and Honduras these people are just trying to circumvent immigration laws and come to the United states illegally\nIf that caravan consisted of journalists lawyers and potential politicians or TV talk show host you can bet that wall would go up in a hurt the\nFact of the matter is that the vast majority of illegal immigrants are coming here for jobs or simply to take advantage of the system I mean that is a fact ... ... what the journalists tried to spin\nThe bottle let's play identity politics for just a moment okay the progressive loaned\nMe let's act like Democrats yeah well you know kind of like that but what to do that okay [noise] um\nThe fact of the matter is you and I have talked about this or the ... commission conducted hearings who studies on this issue [noise] those\nMigrants as they're called who are coming up here which is truly an invading force on moss\nThe vast majority of them are military age males Ninety percent of them I was looking very closely for the alleged families I didn't see him I don't need to be harsh about the schools are just affects the journalist seemed to gloss over [noise]\nBut as we've shown them civil rights condition\nThese individuals are going to be displacing low skilled American workers and what we found that the commission they use that one group\nMost harshly affected by that displacement are black\nMales blacks in general a black males and it's profound that forty percent of the decline in the labor force participation rate among blacks over the last couple of decades is attributable to competition\nLow wage competition from illegal immigrants who tend to congregate and compete with lax in many of the industries that blacks have been historically concentrated switches construction service agriculture so on and so forth when you do the math on it and we have\nWe're talking about nearly one million jobs that blacks have lost due to competition from low wage\nIllegal immigrants and that just to rest but illegal immigrants [noise] now\nIf that were to happen in any other circumstance you can just imagine what the outcry would be American citizens were being harmed if we play the game aggressive on identity politics it is one of the most vulnerable cohorts in America in terms of\nTheir status in society but we don't hear anything about that from the politicians will currently running for office the upcoming election and if you take a look at the Democratic party and there are dependent\nOn the black vote we know that Ninety percent of the black vote traditionally goes to the Democratic candidate for president well same was true with respect other offices but ... percent [noise] and if you only peel away a couple of percentage points\nOf that group from the Democratic\nParty then they effectively become as competitive as the weak part just a couple of points that's all it takes it doesn't require ten percent or Fifteen Percent less why the whole county west German brown who have brouhaha are caused so much consternation on the left because it was a break\nIn the solid wall that the Democrats were progressive depend so that's simply you know if they want to engage an identity politics this is this is\nDamaging to all of America but particularly those favorite groups of the Democratic party and I would suggest that those favorite groups take a hard look at whether their interests are being protected by progressive\nPeter ... is our guest is the is a a commission on the United states commission on civil rights Pete hum you mentioned the wall and your first remark I'm about how fast it would go up if it were those other individuals coming to this country\nAt the wall is is a very interesting point here because correct me if I'm wrong\nEven if we were to build this wall it would not stop what we're seeing right now now it would would stop those who are branching off from the caravan when it gets to our border and rather than going to our point of entry and there's just crossing the river or jumping over a a lame little barbed wire fence you know that we used to consider a barrier for\nUs to stop immigration but if they come that way yeah so what would stop that but all people would have to do is continue to go to the actual imported point of injury which would be gaps in the wall and say asylum I'm claiming asylum you gotta let me in and you gotta let them let me loose 'cause you're not allowed to detain me or my family or my children\nWe found that out with the last caravan that came through or else is going to be a political price to pay and a judge to tell you can't do that you gotta let me listen to the continental us and uh yeah I promise I'll come back for my for my asylum hearing which we know they're going to the wall wouldn't stop that would it be\n[noise] well it it would I think present\nA a a symbolic barrier\nOr it would make things a little bit more difficult I think that it would now you're right that\nWas that your soul to the port of entry and making the silently\nYou sue that happened and again we started this civil rights commission within happens is no more than three to four percent of people with her for their hearing slips guns and disappear into the future of the United states so President Trump is exactly right the laws need to be reformed to have to be more tells you put a wall\nWill have a I Believe to be a significant impact let's just take a look at current events [noise] we had a migration similar to what we're\nWitnessing right now in Europe of Northern Africa in the middle east we had those huge chains of\n... migrants coming across southern Europe into Germany in other places and hungry said no we're not going to do this we're not going to accept this and they\nBuilt a fence or a lack of a better term something more than ... percent something more control wall and everyone to ride it said it was going to be an effective well\nIt went from hundreds of thousands of migrants entering hungry\nTo virtually zero within a year so these barriers work otherwise countries around the world would erecting barriers are they actually work and it's something\nThat is only part of the toolkit you're right that if people are going to be presenting a bogus asylum claims that is and I do think the Detroit valuable walls filed\nRight and do they have to be carrying weapons in order to be considered invading force official which could uh uh justify the use of troops I don't know there's a lot of gray area there but I think\nThat in the first instance the president added states as the commander in chief needs to do what's necessary to secure the for the border\nThat may not include Egypt law enforcement to Detroit is is that it is indeed that Peter thank you so much Peter personnel us commission on civil rights for joining us
