they're going to send a message\nCoast out of our new Internet is disabled generally some at least I'd have to have him talking to me and my ear luckily I've got my\nPatriot and mobile backup journalist's phone from my battle line into the bat cave in the event that anything goes wrong and Susan Glasser joins me now she has a staff writer at the New Yorker\nShe writes a weekly column on life in Donald Trump's Washington DC and of course this week's column is about Brett Kavanaugh Susan welcome back always good to have you fall or on Twitter that what is your Twitter handle isn't SBC one that's been\nThe one that the one\nThat's PG one so Susan I Am a I've got a column in the Washington Post today and I'm outraged I don't know bread cabin up but I Am a father of a\nDaughter I think what they've done to him and his family is outrageous and I believe the blue bubble is keeping a lot of people from realizing what twenty women called the dummy yesterday they are incredibly angry at the Democrats now I Know you're not hearing that or maybe you are you telling me\nAbout it than I paid\nIn America are\nType their hair or where I'm sure you know you're getting their so called object for pictures or just stop blaming her ... a Republican senators there are different true\nAnd I think it's critically\nGlad it's not surprising consequences I'm not sure that that we've all been living with for the last two years and I think that's part of an odd contrition hospital so close to the mid term election trend partisan a favor when they're running high\nAre shown on day one of our talk next it is I\nHave to say but you know that X cheer ship that of course for the worst in that situation once again it goes on and not just the Judiciary Committee that\nI work in a process to uncover the truth in a way that would work\nCan of course I have not their\nOutcomes are and it just makes it very painful ... whatever your political perspective it\nTom Cotton this morning term Sheldon Whitehouse says treatment of the high school yearbook a like it's the did Vinci Code\nAs a dark hole of Sony narrative quoting White House back at himself and that is ... has been swinging from the hips Lindsey Graham's been swinging from the ups the leader went down to the floor and said there he will apply all for cloture this week there will be a vote this week and he also brought up a very interesting thing Susan\nHe brought up I'm Margaret Chase Smith who is people will remember the first senator who was a woman she was from Maine signal hill by Susan Collins she was the first to stand up to Joe McCarthy\nAnd these politics or personal destruction strike me as exact McCarthyism except the charge here is assault and battery against women legit true against Harvey Weinstein Bill Cosby many others not true against Brett Kavanaugh\nJust now how can you know well the\nQuestion is how do they know that it is I've done over the testimony because no evidence has been produced and I I have done ...\nNo no there have been six investigations are have been such fulfilled investigations are Brett Kavanaugh and six fulfilled investigation revealed nothing not even an allegation Dr Ford came forward and as the special counsel probe tour narrative doesn't hold together it needs to be corroborated it's not persuasive\nAnd in the absence of evidence to make the allegation dispositive is McCarthyism\nI think frankly that Harrison that cruel relevant to me is that comparison\nI thought about yesterday ... catch count on a survey or early in his career working round can start here she came out President Bill Clinton and the question and that debate\nThe country is happening right now and the question fundamental I Am in the top of that could charge by that are going on in the effort to air\nNot sure but you know Iraq debate about perjury in which case statements about his rookie micro relevant out or is it really about the underlying issue that's been raised by Dr Ford and the others which as you point out I\nBeen a subject yet again going back to ... and I took the FBI because they are working on right now are we talking about that and he produced are we talking about the underlying question of the perhaps I Will go a issue or what happened to change your teenagers who makes me\nVery much focus on the first issue I I you and I disagree\nI think it does a difficult at all unless we change the standard of due process but on the issue of line he did not lie he did not perjure him so he said he drank he drank a lot he drank to the point of falling asleep\nThan the people who are out there on the Web saying he ... himself are themselves lying because he never said that and and do you have any testimony that has been contradicted by anything less far\n[noise] you really think that he\nTo Ralph thing a and throwing out the coverage when we come back and not because they're drinking\nUh yes I Do yes I Do that and of course the high school yearbook as a woman who grew up in the ninth inning when a bank there are facts garnished\nBallplayers acting very poorly I agree it's worst nightmare\nI agree with that you guys protector I\nBut it's certainly relevant that question the way in which black ... would be just an Amish cream court presented himself to catch\nThere is no way that his discussion back and forth about Raul thing is perjury there just is no way that that is lying medicines characterization it could well be true it is not lying and in fact he said there were many jokes about the fact that he would often throughout that just means you can't hold the beer\nThat just means you can't hold anything and it also occurs to among other things but that's not lying about perjury\nAnd I think Susan fundamentally the reason you saw Heidi Heitkamp numbers plumbing\nAnd I don't know if you saw the polio she went from four points behind it ten points behind in one week thing four points at ten points in one week what does that tell you\nWe started out and I think if the court are going to circle back to work right in the middle of a selection my own view is that in the shower America's\nMars and I just kept on which I guess is we'll permanently\nBe competing versions of what's happening here in the country that this might be around rallying parties increasingly distraught and\nUpset a political base it and it would not at all surprised me a ... at that were the case for Heidi Heitkamp in a very solidly red state at the same time obviously he said he factor\nFor many women in British stage who are concerned that the testimony of women is not\nBeing hurt seriously and so I think you could actually ration\nAppears to the country and yet\nMotivate voters different parts of the country are in different parties to come out and I\nI I see that happening already but Mitch McConnell that with my final point I wanted to make you know what he meant to the park changed very clearly playing for the vote that he doesn't have\nYet of shoes and caused a Republican from Maine and essentially trying to find ways to get her and I think in the end was driving a ... Senate ... you know and the Senate and it's not about national polls over their relevant it's about public and Mitch McConnell\nHad the ... you wouldn't be having this guy that station I mean clearly ... a and he's still looking for the urge to pin down cabin on the second half of them you know uh bring to the floor and victory regardless I think I'm a you know what stands for the country in terms of what we don't we don't know\nI think you're right I think he's going to move it forward I think he's going to get Joe mansion id I'd camp any and and I don't know about any other one being undecided except those five senators he'll get Jeff Flake but I Want to go back to one last comment\nA please be open to a third narrative inside the beltway right now it's the two Americas narrative there's a third America which doesn't much care about politics\nBut they are fair and decent people\nAnd this has been in decent to the judge they know that Dianne Feinstein sat on it they know that it was leaked\nThey know that that would ... stories like the rape or on the boat on the road island that Sheldon Whitehouse retail in the media was wrong and has been recanted and will be prosecuted\nThey got a meter that is about fundamental fairness and it's been implanted and since McCarthyism and the new Roy Jones Sheldon Whitehouse and his gang I think Susan that that that we just got to be open inside the beltway to the idea\nNot just reds being redder and blue thing blower but people in the middle of the purple our best\nYou know I don't know but my guess is that uh they already have Congress pretty much say generally has an approval rating in single digits and uh I don't get angry there are aircraft and of course the Republicans you run Congress like\nWe're we're

platform on which to speak like Brett Kavanaugh dead Brett Kavanaugh defended himself and was persuasive\nBut a lot of people like Jack Philips in barrels Stutzman they don't have a place to go they don't have anyone to speak for them that's where alliance defending freedom steps up\nAnd stands in there is a banner over a year you're dot com it's says I'm a I'm a\nI guess I Want to defend religious freedom that's what the banner says\nIf you click it you can contribute to the alliance defending freedom today and because of a generous donor who was so impressed with their record at the

discovered that in fact the light bulbs needed changing and a battery needed replacing\nThose were the epic failures I had ruled out that the lights might have burned out because for them on out simultaneously I thought it had to be a short in the system\nAnd that affects them as as you suggested I changeable but I said no no honey that cap yet to set yeah they all went out the same time that cap yet and one of them controlled from the control didn't go out and so the ... you were allowed to change the light bulb and I said no that's not it sweetheart leave this technical stuff to me\nAnd uh she also bought a new battery which turned out to fix the eye\nOr whatever they call that box so St came in the first thing he said it's all it's just troubled shoe let's just change out the ball to just in case and sure enough the for bombs were burned out\nAnd he's very gracious he said you're trouble shooting skills are in a different domain\nNot a good way to say I'm so glad that Twain
