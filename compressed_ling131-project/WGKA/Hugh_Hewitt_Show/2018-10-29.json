United States Senate and the show me state against Claire McCaskill and the most recent polling I obscene has him ahead by a very solid for points I actually believe it's further ahead than that\nJosh Hawley welcome back to the show my right you're farther ahead in most places in four points\nWe feel uh we feel very good about it you but we also know that we've got eight days ago and we cannot take anything for granted that it's gonna be a tight race going to be tied all the way home and we've got to get out there and a while we you know that I said\nNo I haven't heard a lot of places in Missouri from St Louis we got a big flame thrower there to cross Jefferson City et cetera so tell people in Missouri specifically are they still able to do early voting or is that closed\nWhere we are but just traditional absentee voting in Missouri we don't have a we don't have early voting like other states but the traditional as a voting and\nA look we need folks to start planning to get out on November the ... that makes sure that you set aside time to vote talk to your friends if if they uh I Need help getting to the polls to make sure that you know you're you take a friend with you at the polls and we're going to need every last vote because it's going to be like\nJosh Hawley it seems to me though that the Democrats are basically folding their tent in Missouri in North Dakota to try and saved by boat so there were Claire McCaskill out an awful debate performance she and her ads calling other Democrats crazy Democrats how did that play with her base\nWell you know I I think it does that Rick ethical really has read\nThe desperation phase of her campaign I mean you could see that and in our debate\nLast Thursday very angry very frustrated but your ears of thank you her first race in Israel is not with the with the voters of the state and they have not done with the voters of the they told her to do is not done what he promised them she would do\nAnd they're not happy about it and and that's the problem that has\nA role and Martin who's of course of men in the lab but he's a friend of mine just pointed out\nThe Claire McCaskill not quote one of those crazy Democrats quote ad was one of the dumbest ever recorded in political history she needed a strong energized space in twenty Eighteen her appeal to white rural voters\nWith that ad ticked off black voters if she loses that ad is the reason so you can see right there uh Josh Hawley that she clearly is flailing\nWell I I think there's no doubt about that I mean is it playing at the good word\nI see is a frustrated she's desperate you is you know let's remember what we saw from the Democrats\nAnd the Kavanaugh near the few short weeks ago is that they are willing to stay and do anything in order to regain power and I'm afraid that are McCaskill who was with that mirror every step of the way that is no different than so this is really this election as a referendum\nOn what they want to do to our country on their behavior there is a disgrace that they are carried out with regards to judge Kavanaugh on their entire agenda that with his lectures about\nNow let's talk a little bit about the the judge Kevin on the confirmation now justice cabinet or a successful confirmation\nClaire McCaskill was invisible uh she didn't she she voted against him but she was invisible because she couldn't figure out what to do what in Missouri and think about that because he's obviously a good man well qualified and he was ... what do they think about her hiding from that debate\nOh I think there appalled by it and I had people say that the all the time they just cannot believe\nThe the Kavanaugh was treated they can't believe the way the Senate Democrats the coordinated your campaign your rights that are McCaskill\nUh well she went right along with it you should never raised their voices against it but she lets us forget she was in favor of the Democratic sham investigation she was in favor of delaying his confirmation votes so that the circus could go on I mean she's on record for all of those things so she was part and parcel\nOf the whole smear campaign and now she says it's actually said our debate all I didn't have anything to do with that oh that's just nonsense she was there every step of the way and I think voters are going to remember\nNow let's talk about the tragedy of this weekend a Josh Hawley when you get to the United States Senate you're going to be in a body that's very deeply divided in a country that is profoundly broken but I think part of the

aren't because we are eight days from a crucial election and we are\nOn the other side of a terrible massacre in Pittsburgh and a range to bomber in Florida and the incendiary rhetoric across the

to put a\nWhat the no nothing movement in context is because last night I saw a lot of people on line saying that Donald Trump is leading the modern no nothing's which is simply not historically correct and I knew I could turn to you for similar to a you know ... what the no nothing to work\nAs well so nineteenth century political movement or they didn't they thought that uh Jews and Catholics and and that that they're especially focused on them\nAnd you know I don't know why anybody would be be against Jews but Catholics now that I Would say that we have to have to deprive ourselves of the of our sense of humor in these days but um they they ah you know let Lincoln a lot of them voted for Lincoln or\nLincoln denounce them and what they thought was that that it was a Protestant country of white country and that it would be better if it remains so\nAnd they and that you know they were spread around the country quite widely they never had a huge percentage of the vote and they were important because you know in fact there isn't anybody quite like that important enough to make a difference today that I Know of but they were important because politics for very narrowly drawn for\nFifteen or Twenty years divided on the slavery question but then ancillary matters that could get four or five or two or three percent of the vote could change things a lot so they were important in American politics\nAnd they were ah they were not a passing phase they've never really gone away the idea of nativism into the eye that white Protestants on the country\nBut neither have they ever been very powerful and I do not believe they make up much or even an infant testimony percentage of the Trump coalition I don't believe I asked Secretary Clinton this when she was on the show last year\nDo you believe there's more than a half million white nationalist in the United states and she agreed with me that there isn't and and ... were mixed up two hundred and thirty million people I just don't believe it is that many people do\nOne of them can do a horrific slaughter as was done Saturday in Pittsburgh we ought not to overestimate because by doing so we encourage the over estimation of their hatred\nA trade and ah you know I and not only do I do not believe that they're very many people like that I don't believe they're very many people who believe that there are very many people like that in fact many of the people who say that there are a lot of people like that I don't believe they believe it I think it's a political tool\nYes and explain why by the way I think it's going to burn their hand for picking up this tool ah and specifically I talk this morning\nAbout uh the network to which I contribute MSNBC is running high rise to lower third the little the words at the bottom of the of the screen I Want to read to a couple of them Trump's role in stoking violence among Americans how Trump sets the tone for anti Semite\nYou see they have picked up this this white hot\nSlander and I don't think it ensures the president I think it burns the people who employ it what do you think\nWell so this is a really great Holleman Jenkins car column on the wall Street Journal I read this morning it might have been from last week um and he makes the point that that a\n... you know everybody except for tiny sliver of the population or all of whom are probably watching MSNBC who knows um\nThink that there's just way too much of this stuff right that that this politically correct talk\nOr you know making Kelly him I have never liked by the way but she got fired and if she just left off one expression what she said was entirely on objectionable and somebody at Netflix to write and sell their\nChords that go after but horse how big are the hordes right and as and as you say in a country of three hundred million plus\nHow big are these hordes and the answer is not very big because most people don't think I mean if you just walk about in society and look\nYou will see the evidence of the fact that the society is organized around the principle of human equality and what human equality means of is a person treated like a person treats the same person like a person\nSo you just see in society today and it wasn't always true was black people by the way which is a blight on our history but you but it is true today just look and see and then you know if you think it's always been a racist country goes\nStudied the Eighteen fifty eight election for the Senate\nIn in Illinois where Abraham Lincoln won the popular vote on the claim that the black woman and not be are equal in all respects but in her right to eat the bread that she earns with the sweat ever owned face she is the equal every person on earth\nAnd I want a new audience we've added to affiliates today a documentary on who have not heard you before and therefore will take some getting used to we have to knock them in a news radio fourteen ten WTO being Dover, Delaware and radio news radio fourteen fifty W. I. L. M. in Wilmington, Delaware so they will not\nThere was one of the states that Lincoln had to worry about keeping in the union right donor was was a slave holding state him at the time of the civil war and Lincoln had to work very hard as he said\nI Hope that God on my side but I must have Kentucky he he needed the states and so he acted as a political person with regards to everyone in there but those sorts of politics that sort of new one is lost in cable when\nI mean it just it's all your evil or you're not evil and by the way it's not just on the left it's on the right as well and I think it's destroying politics\nWell I I don't so that I think that's right and and you know there was a lot of extremism in America in the Eighteen fifties goodness sakes you know there were plots to kill Lincoln and let them succeeded finally but\nBut it's also true though that those debates between Lincoln and Douglas or very worth reading and then if you read them fairly in my in my argument if you read them fairly will see that the inspiring man one\nAnd the man who spoke for the meaning of America One and it's just a remarkable event in human history because\nThey would get twenty thousand people\nOut in the sun sitting for four hours to watch those debates and and that that means that in America there is this you know basic way that we get along as Americans and it's the principle that everyone who demeans himself as a good citizen quote George Washington\nHas the rights of a citizen and must all and and that means that the bias is there's a bias the bias is when you encounter somebody on the street treat him like a human being a\nMan who spoke for the meaning of America One I think that is so ... would you explain what that means\nWell the you know and so you know all political history by the way has tragedy in it and there's even an argument it always ends in tragedy but are\nAre tragedy they're very many ... remember that it's the most glorious political story at least in modern times and the tragedy is that for the first time we found it a country according to the principle that all men are created equal\nAnd buy all men they meant women too and and then we had savory among us and been here for a long time here under British Rule and so what do we do about that and in the founding there's a consensus that it's a really bad thing\nSomething's got to be done about that eventually and then more than sixty percent of the union it was quickly abolished ah but then new ideas took this route and this is where the tragedy is in my opinion these new ideas said that no we're evolutionary figures\nAnd we evolved to be different kinds of things and by the way if you look at the thought of modern liberalism radical modern left wing liberal is some you will see lots of thinking just like this fight we talked about genes all the time now\nSo it's like it's like somehow your genes control your behavior which means that humans soldiers not free anyway that gets going\nAnd by Eighteen twenty that's a major force in America and then what are you going to do about it right and then the and what we did about it was we fought our worst war over the question is human being a product\nThat the American heritage and there's no reason to believe that Kevin McCarthy does not does not feel the weight and greatness of that just like everybody who knows this
