Maher calcium watchdog on Wall street Hey Chris morning question for your question are we ready\nWith four thousand people headed towards the U.S Mexican border should we closed the border\nUsing our military yes or no\nOh yes I I totally agree um again I don't know the legal logistics by that I\nCan do it we can do it\nI have talked about this yesterday on my program it's textbook definition of an invasion now got a four thousand people to fly the flag\nFlying the Honduran flight for crying out loud I mean it's\nI mean they're not all Hondurans Chris\nAll over Central America um last time I checked was that the leader of the group was arrested 'em by Mexican authorities and um but that that maybe that might put a stop to us but you know I think it will further you know that this this group was funded by sorrows\nLast yes yes uh\nI mean they were going to start looking at him and then the various things that he was doing with his money here in this country and you know we really want it to you could put us on him and his financial transactions and shut him\nDown I mean all that ... that are no brainer states that's a no brainer Annette needs to be done that definitely needs to be done he's the instigators\n[laughter] and I I Would put a ... you know basically ... the the courage to him to some degree but we just go whatever reason is like a James Bond villain for crying out loud nobody ever what goes after my watch touch him\nYeah yeah yeah I I Know that that's very unfortunate isn't it All right let's talk about Canada for a second because Canada made\nNews this week for all the wrong reasons Canada's become the first major world economy to legalize recreational marijuana they did so the middle of this week and they're now buying to also introduced legislation that will partner citizens who were previously convicted possession comment\nSo I mean listen if you legalize pot I mean I can understand why you're gonna ban you know let people go or you know nailed on the fence prior I think that that makes sense I talked about this a long time yesterday on my program because there's a lot of business implications with this\nAs well because this is going to be a billion dollar business right out without a doubt um they they say twenty percent of the population and can that smokes\nPot I don't know if that's going to increase uh doing I talked about it yesterday at the drug that's not a social drug it's at the motivational\nType a drug but again we can sit and watch 'em you know there's been calls for legalizing marijuana here in the United states if our uh you know are are probably one of our closest cousins in regards to our country is concerned Canada to the north\nOr I Would watch to see how it plays out up there Jay how it works out for those guys and um you know but then we can make our decision and what direction we want to go\nI'm not a fan of the drug at all I'm not but I also understand the hypocrisy and uh what people can say hey you know what alcohol is legal and it's not good for you\nTobacco is legal and it's not good for you caffeine is legal right down to list the various different things that are legal so I understand the ... uh when it comes to this truck I I Do I get it so right now I Would just kind of sit back and watch and see what's gonna happen up there\nYou know what I heard Canada somebody from Canada talking about what Tucker Carlson of the other night I think it was two nights ago um and uh he said he remember he rewrite them off all the different taxes you know that they were going to the revenues are going to bring in and that's why they did it but anyway let's ...\nEven though the with the taxes that they the price of marijuana I was curious about that yesterday the price of marijuana buying it on the government the way that they're set it up now is not much different than the price that would be buying it on the black market so they didn't they were smart enough not to do that where people would go back to the black market\nI I just think that Justin Trudeau was reasoning\nOne of the reasons he says he says it's got to keep it out of the hands of the youth by having the government take control Chinese that that's at the absurd idea I mean if you want to do labor gonna mental element yeah your idea what the deal with the criminal element and get that out of your country I get that but no kids are going to be doing the drugs\nAll right well it seems that every company's got a job for you today because job openings him hit a record high layoffs are already fifty year low the numbers that I'm looking at right now the number of\nAmericans losing their jobs and applying for unemployment benefits uh each week remain near a forty nine year low in mid October suggesting there is no visible deterioration in the U.S labor market\nYeah without a doubt the numbers look absolutely fantastic uh and you know week by week to continue to look stronger um again I just wish people kind of understood the type of position we're in and compare it to the rest of world at how much are with that economy growing like\nA it is um you know what a what a Trump said last night is that Democrats create mobs we create the chops\nYeah yeah yeah and let me just let me just say something\nTo that because I get around I travel a lot I'm assuming if you're traveling quite a bit around in the northeast too but I'm traveling all around of Florida in at least a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty miles us radios and sometimes a little more than that I actually went up to Panama City or over the weekend that's a story for a different day but\nEven up their jobs I mean they're the jobs to clean up to fix up to build up there just everywhere and then they're gonna have to bring in people from outside the state of was told\nAt well again I I ... that explains why we have so many people that are still on unemployment or shouldn't be a there's more than enough\nThat's in that that you're\nOn a more than that and you know the reality is got to get those people off the couch and we've got to get them working we can transfer payments now on average right now I can be upwards of thirty thousand dollars and individual um that's quite and pricing and people still don't want to get off\nThe government assistance and go back to get a job and we have to do everything and anything we can get these people back to work\nI agree because there's nothing better than having a nice job and you know three three three cats and they count as they used to say in the house a roof over your head and everything else well yeah I got I'm looking at my time here you got ten minutes to go on and we'll talk to you on Monday morning so you have yourself a great

disaster I got family all over Panama City my wife does too so every prayer and every continuing good wish to the good people of Florida wherever a bit\nThat that entire damage range may be a but it was a I'm I'm guessing some political damage done there the Tampa Bay area by you and everybody might Gallagher and various other people on the stage seeking to explode the myths\nOf the blue wave I Do have I I I don't just have good news here from Texas a I've got fresh news here from Texas I was hanging out with my buddy Ted Cruz there was a name drop of a lifetime but it's true or just last night we did a Facebook Live\nBroadcast you could probably go I'm just at that that that uh the at Ted Cruz page on Facebook a the the main with us to point one million followers so that was called\nAnd it was kind of a sudden because I'll I'll pull back the curtain a little bit and take kind of what happened 'cause ... had a a had a vanity infomercial on CNN last night and doubled down on Trump impeachment that's always a winner\nIn taxes of\nI'll give you some uh some some view from here on the ground as the saying goes in Texas and by the way that's where I Am and his great to be

a time to look at weekend movies with sunny bunch\nThat means I have seen\nIt means I have an hour and forty minutes to figure out exactly how to massage the first demand issue [laughter] guess what new sunny and I have in common we both love whew what the study and I have in common we think the first man controversy as ridiculous\nAs it I get to get some Chad and some ... and this caravan of of folks coming to the border what do you want to do about it one eight hundred five two oh one two three four one eight hundred five two oh one two three four\nJamal to show he as a human being I care\n... he's one of God's Children he was brutally murdered and chopped up and a little bit it's terrible\nAs an American how much am I supposed to twist off about this exact bleed is a question I'm asking maybe you're asking yourself to let's try to cobble some answers together at one eight hundred five two oh one two three four movies coming out this weekend we'll talk about that with sunny but I just I I've just got to commiserate with my buddy\nOf of all why be sunny I mean I Love it comes right with you about when I went to war with this uh with my Gallagher because\nIt's the knee jerk reaction\nOf of of the decade there is no such thing as far as I'm saying is one time and then but I'll pick it up with sunny if necessary there is no such thing\nAs a human being\nWho has seen first man and thinks the American flag was slighted no such thing I'll just leave it at that it is a magnificent film it drips with American achievement I walked out of it as proud to be an American as I've ever been and so\nJust if you're sitting there thinking you know global is Hollywood pitiful by the way there's plenty of global as Hollywood ... no don't listen if you're looking for ways in which Hollywood dishonor as America he will not have to look far but don't look at us movie 'cause it does not happen is magnificent and there's the stuff on the Oscars for director Damien ...\nAnd Ryan Gosling who is ... and clarify as Mrs Armstrong he is no perfect as Neal\nThat what you're talking about the IRS named drop even bigger than Ted Cruz you're already ten years ago I had a chance to hang with Neil Armstrong I Know how to man up well this is helpful and living in this town is help but we have a wonderful I'm\nJule and the crowd of DFW called the frontiers of flight museum and ten years ago we did a fortieth anniversary of the beginning of the Apollo program because obviously if you do the math that means the fiftieth anniversary is now and you are correct\nAbout that [noise] uh and Apollo seven a crewman won't Cunningham knows a lot of other astronauts and so I'm looking to Neil and buzz and bill Anders one Apollo ... and Alan ... now late Alan Bean walked on the moon Apollo twelve of Fort Worth guy and I\nI I Am seat a panel with all these guys I'm pension myself because believe you me I Am a ... but take cue and his feelings about the Cleveland Browns that is me and and manned spaceflight some time which is probably a horribly clumsy analogy but uh\nThat was me I mean I'm sixty right now so in in my pre adolescent years through my adolescent years we're all the Apollo missions I live with them I Breathe in them and uh it it simply must be a God Singh aware through through a set of circumstances that I scarcely deserve that I was able to meet and hang out and speak\nWith these folks and we'll was very unassuming he was very much the American hero very much uh the the the uh [noise]\nThe enthusiast for his country but he was also very aware that he was ... he was representing humanity and this is the thing that made me probably the most nuts about the whole first men controversy it's like we had to pick sides\nIt's either an American achievement or a human achievement guys it's both\nThey're not mutually exclusive okay enough about that enough enough enough enough enough [noise]\nAll right what's the best thing that I can share with you about Ted Cruz and a ... for months and months and months and months you maybe not so much lately but for many moons are all the stories were pouring out of my state of Texas\nIt's a close race oh Ted Cruz's in trouble to Texas is gonna turn purple and the weight of turning blue oh there's never been a candidate like Mexico Ted Cruz's are\nRunning scared every single one of those stories were crap\nJust to use the vernacular or\nIt was ridiculous it is ridiculous this was never a close race on paper now were there a couple of polls\nThat there was one that had a beta with like a one or two point lead well we know the kind of recent history that polling organizations have had no don't wait but in fairness to that industry\nPolls are a snapshot\nOf enthusiasm of the ... that are taken in the blink of an eye\nIf you go back when was that ... by one or two a month and a half ago company and something like that ... August September [noise] it is possible\nThat exists survey with a sample size of acts might have run into a vein of Democrat enthusiasm because let me tell you a Democrat enthusiasm in my state is higher than it has been in a long time now what does that mean\nWhat does that mean it means that Ted Cruz is not going to beat ... by sixteen points as he did Paul Sadler six years ago to get to the Senate it's not going to be a sixteen point when\nIn fact it could be made as much as ten points closer\nI Believe that the ... and it's kind of a wide range but hey it's an election who knows these days predicting as a very sketchy game I consider the range of possibilities\nFor the Ted Cruz Beto O'Rourke race when we wake up on November seventh or go to bed really late have been Mike is on the sex I Believe the range of possibility is Ted Cruz winning by four to Ted Cruz winning by twelve\nTo eight points but day I die if if he wins by for that means that Cruz voters were lazy it means that Texas Republicans were complacent it means that we sat on our dust and we thought we got this and it and in that\nCapacity I never want to be part of the problem 'cause I'm here I live here my show is here\nAnd I know and I was I was hanging out with my buddies in the Ted Cruz campaign last night to the Facebook Live with that I it's it's still post and the thing is we had a good time is about forty minutes or so talking about stuff pulling back the curtain on a few things to tell them and Ted Cruz Facebook page\nAt that as we get down to election day\nIf it's for points or five or God Forbid free or something like that it will be like beta one and we'll never be rid of these people [laughter] I mean we have Democrats in Texas we just don't let them run the place and uh\nNot everybody does talk shows for a living not everybody analyzes politics for a living some sometimes you just put in your pants on trying to get to work trying to get\nTo school totally get it to the country feel like it's better run now than it was you know three four five six seven eight years ago new our borders feel stronger does our military feel better care for it to our events feel better care for do you have a job\nThere's a reason for that sold the Trump agenda it's working there is no substitute for success and you may you may not be a diamond will you know check all the boxes conservative fine I get it all work on you [laughter] but uh there's [laughter] he just\nYeah let Democrats get a hold of the house you just can't\nThe tax cuts gone [noise]\nImpeachment poisoning our

people who are in dogging President Trump and secretary of state Mike Pompeo to quote unquote do something about the Saudis for killing one guy did not care one flip about hopping into bed with Iran one of those murderous terrorists regimes in history\nSome spare me the hand wringing outrage from some of these people\nBut let's see what happened to the phones one eight hundred five to a one two three four let us role to Pittsburgh rich Mark Davis in for you Happy Friday thanks for calling\nOn it are going on and off the hook or yesterday the state court or a Democrat but I've heard\nYeah and in fact on us at ... or Harriet ... an hour later and running yet at all\nAnd the dust is a great ... ... that are not in that regard and\n... and you are you are right and they have every part of the ballot is important down to your local court house I mean Texas is pretty conservative edited Dallas used to be pretty conservative but in two thousand six\nOut of a flip the court House Democrats not run the judiciary of Dallas and it's been that kind of a nightmare ever since every every line on the ballot matters if you have if you have straight ticket voting wherever you live do it Democrats do it Republicans must learn how to do it as well we're in Columbus Buckeye country Chris hey Mark Davis in for you welcome our you\nSaid you're good morning lark I wanted I wanted to talk to you real quick about health care in your take on something like I work at a big hospital I'm In the Columbus area I Me and my family tend not to go to see doctors because\nWe can't afford the ... the co pays hum wow so my question is I enter like Obama my song PBS how that whole deal with Obamacare was put together it's a sham um how\nHow is it that\nI'm covered just gotten worse for some um it's covering others now I understand that but it didn't address the elephant in the room which is insurance companies exactly\nYou've asked exactly the right question and it's because insurance companies have been bludgeoned by this suddenly of\nPressing obligation first for starters to cover people with preexisting conditions if you and I run an insurance company and all of a sudden when there are millions of people we've suddenly got to cover and they're sick already what do you think we're going to do the premiums they are going to skyrocket that's my free market solutions state run state funded risk pools\nCan help folks like you free market solutions can help bring rates down to bring premiums down can bring co pays down the Affordable CARE Act has been\nAll night for [noise]\nAmerican to you and I left there this\nAll place in New York City than Pittsburgh oh\nMy cameras or to bring has been good news\nTurn cruise versus that radio guy I think it's good news at least take it away my friend\nThanks very much you Eddie is in the good news last night I had a great pleasure of doing a little Facebook Live on Ted Cruz's a\nFacebook page which would make sense you can go to a take a look at that it was filled with a\nWith a boot charm and authenticity [laughter] like when one point the images kind of went sideways we had to mess with that for a little bit but it was a it was always straight shooting from Ted we talked about a\nA number of things going on in the end be cruising O'Rourke raise I give you from taxes my honest take which is unwavering him as the cruise wins and it is not that close cruise wins and it will not be that close now\nDon't messed me up here in Texas\nThat everybody listening I'm a huge would affiliates through the great state of Texas need to make sure that I'm right about this it's not about me but it's about our state it's about our country and that means that if if that is I think the blue wave is already dissipating\nBut is there a Democrat enthusiasm in taxes is there a Democrat enthusiasm all over the country in the first opportunity that Democrats have to interrupt the Trump agenda for the most conservative governance we've had since Reagan you bet there's Democrat energy\nBut the good news is there is Republican energy and it is fresh fully motivated the cabin only hearing absolutely had an effect it made us\nIn Suzie asked about the way we acted I I mean when when all of a sudden conservatives on their list of heroes\nList Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins you know\nEveryone has been made better there has been a conservative spine infusion and Lindsey Graham I I I I Can't knock love the guy\nHe's dead wrong and immigration maybe we should check back maybe got better on that too but on a whole lot of other things especially a war on terror national defense national security he's he's inspiring lay correct and wonderful Lindsey Graham ah\nIs it has been a joy to behold for these last few weeks since that moment of magnificent righteous indignation\nThere in the Senate Judiciary committee what are you just gave it to a Democrat America for what they've done gave it to his Democratic colleagues for what they've done absolutely great and then Susan Collins a wonderful woman\nOr a New England Republican meaning Swiss cheese conservatism unless they we don't we don't do Republicans in New England the way we do Republicans in taxes or\nOr or or Mississippi or Utah right it's a New England Republican we used to have Democrats in Texas were more conservative than some New England Republicans but it was it I'd rather have an are by somebody's name in the state of Maine\nThen somebody in the state of Maine in the Senate with a D by their name so I've never sat at home driven my fingers on the table going oh citizen Valentine never lamented that you take what you can get and all we got from Susan Collins is magnificent clarity I Am here in ... two principal and the vote that got us justice\nBrett Kavanaugh I Will be for ever grateful and meanwhile she better have food tasters and I am not kidding\nI mean they're they're they're mysterious packages being center her home Lindsey Graham is being being spat on everybody's being dogged and screamed at an airport and I know it's a long walk from being screened at an airport to\nBeing shot but today's violent left is something that cannot be ignored the unhinged left exists and I've I've just\nGot to tell you if you are in the Senate and you were a yes vote on Kavanaugh you better but I think our security is a very good idea\nAnd I am not kidding\n[noise] um here's an example of of of of someone who was getting a little I guess this is the Al Smith memorial foundation charity dinner in New York and a ton of money gets raised mostly for children's charities it's absolutely great and it tends to have a\nPolitical keynote speaker engaging in moments that are not so dry and political ... last year it was for example house Speaker Paul Ryan\nAnd this year they secured and keynote speaker who is certainly attracted some attention of life and that would be soon to be former UN ambassador Nikki Haley\nSo think about it okay Nikki Haley is your keynote speaker in the first comment she had last evening was about the selection process that led to her\nSeries about like Paul Ryan ... scout and that's fine but I Love Oregon [noise]\nHere you wanting to buy things again right\nYou want any more than\n... DNA [noise]\n\nE. okay [laughter]\nTime up of a brief worried about Nikki Haley I just love her or she will you know when I make my list of my favorite un ambassadors ever which I guess I'll do if I ever had some time I buy and\nUh you know John Bolton was on that list probably at the top of that list a higher and she's she's just great but as governor of South Carolina great I think one of the things I really like about her especially in this era where we were just poisoned by the\nThe ... of of ... mood and a new annoying book from Ben Sasse and\nYou know and and God Bless Jeff Flake kind of wish anybody ill I I Want everybody to just just go in there if you're going into private life just go do that and go do whatever you want to do\nAnd just just leave me alone with his hand wringing self low achieving navel gazing you know conservatism is bad under drugs drugs the anti Christ just just take that and and walk down appear All right um\nBut Nikki Haley is an example speaking of governors so is my other good friend and former Texas Governor Rick Perry in so many others I can name\n[noise] of people who who not only didn't know what to think about Donald Trump they flat out didn't like it they oppose the mice ally the concept of his presidency the concept of his nomination and you know what they did\nThey came around they came around they open their eyes they open their minds and said wow okay maybe there are some stylistic things that I didn't love about this guy but I sure a lot of the results\nI Love this economy I Love are stronger borders I Love the dismantling of the regulatory state I Love the tax cuts I Love it\nThere there's a ... [noise] so God Bless Nikki Haley now her exit ramp just days before the midterms\nThat's a little weird I wondered about that\nI was talking to Sebastian Gorka on on my local show the other day\nI said you know what what's the deal with the with Nikki Haley there is no derailed markers or well okay wow All right er at ... says it I'm going with it [laughter] he said listen every once in a while you know the the the the rigors of public life\nAs she has the afternoon makes them more money in private life which apparently important got you know two college age kids and so I I totally get it I totally get it I totally get it um\nWe might have wait until after the midterms but it it probably doesn't matter and and all the Trump haters the Trump haters instantly began to elevate there's going to be great she's got a primary Trump and twenty twenty she's in a primary trumping twenty twenty guess what\nNo she's not\nBecause number one I Believe she's woman for word she says I'll be supporting this guy I think she said this one she referred to the president as this one didn't she got a point over and says you are in the opposite no I'm ...

you inside the sole inside the helmet inside the spacecraft is a remarkable movie\nYeah I I I thought it was quite good I mean look and there are reasons to criticize the film I've read a plenty of negative reviews that that had in an intelligent accurate things to say about the film\nBut if you read in your avoiding this movie is because you think uh that it eighth America but you are you're doing it wrong as hard as we as a kid that\nI Know we've got at least one or two new ones but give me thirty seconds is star is born as good as thirty people I Know say it is\nI mean look at it\nAnd

constitution but also about Winston Churchill in Shakespeare and all of our conversations which began in twenty Thirteen about Homer\nAnd it brought us to the constitution itself today are all founded ... failed dot com doctor aren't Good Friday morning to thank you for joining me\nGood to you too All right we're back because of current events\nI have to go backwards in our constitution series to article one section three the United States Senate and the reason I'm doing that is not\nSurprisingly as the Republicans seemed intent upon keeping and indeed expanding their Senate majority we've seen online and on the air arguments that the Senate is non representative and must be changed that it's wrong for North Dakota have two senators et cetera so I thought\nLarry aren't as the founders key author one of his great books on the ... and what they intended and we're\nAnd it's talking about the Senate and what it is supposed to do this morning\nAn article one section three says the center of the United states shall be composed of two senators from each state chosen by the legislature there are for six years in each senator show have one vote now we're choosing part has been changed\nBy the seventeenth and limit which now reads the Senate or the United states should be comprised of two senators from each state elected by the people there um for six years and each ... one boat that was ratified in Nineteen Thirteen\nSo our original document was updated in Nineteen Thirteen wrongly are rightly but we kept Matt Larry aren't we kept that\nTwo senators would you explain the theory and practice their up\nA well the the ... original is slightly different from the\nUh they both have the same central principal the original was a compromise in the ... the biggest compromise in that that made the constitution come together\nAnd that the compromise was shell there'd be two chambers both represent ... just the population of the United states or shall there'd be two chambers one of them represent any of the states and the that compromise was necessary to get the constitution through\nAnd in my opinion also good\nAnd I will tell you that James Madison and Alexander Hamilton who was the initial enemies of the compromise\nThey came around to that way of thinking to justice convention produced a consensus on most of the big things and why well at the the thing is they were looking out already upon a continent and they didn't know how big it was yet they they didn't find that out for almost Twenty years\nUh actually you know almost Twenty years Lewis and Clark yeah Lewis and Clark right so somebody came back you know is big day when Lewis and Clark outback\nTell me and I'm like I said it's a big country [laughter] what what is this thing you know and that but they were\nKeenly interested in the thing right so George Washington's army was called the continental army\nAnd then the question is and they also very much believed and this is in the art arguments of the federalist papers more than the anti federalist but it's in both sets of papers in various places\nThe argument is you're going to have to have a big country and you're gonna have to have a big country for a lot of reasons but one of them that's obvious and simple is national defense\nAnd we don't want to build another Europe here we don't want you know all that you know the borders neighbors wars constant intrigue and so they were interested in extending the fear of the United states has a deeper reasons or in federal is nine\nAnd a there about how you can get better divisions of power and ultimately more excellence in government by having to watch here so they're they're gonna be a big country now the question is how do you represent\nAnd just take the Senate is like\nA massive fact that happened in the same summer is riding constitution in the northwest ordinance they devised a method for the country to grow and the method is not that to the new territory will ever be treated as a colony it would not\nIt would be treated as a territory soon to become a state and then there's one thing that's always a consensus in the ... in the in the founding era and then the constitutional convention and that is most things done by government will be done locally\nAs close to the people as possible so\nNow at the national level you've got to represent continent\nAnd you know huge diverse changes in territory and geography and therefore the way people live\nAnd so you want to represent that too and you want to represent the whole of it because the challenge is to unite a great empire liberty so the Senate is for balancing its for protection of local and it's for uniting the country\nSection by section into a whole\nTo stitch out of many disparate parts one quilt of liberty now Larry our and our framers were awesome on horseback traveling great distances not just during the revolutionary war but before and after and back and forth to the Annapolis convention to the Philadelphia conventions or stay ratifying you mentioned\nAnd they were acquainted with the diversity of this great country and this is not merely though it is partially a slave owning interest versus the abolitionist interest is not merely that\nThey also recognize that there were Merck until the states like New York\nAn agrarian states like Georgia and small states like Ryder Rhode Island and vast states like Virginia which at the time of this was literally unlimited I Believe a because we've got ... all the way extending as far as it could go so what part did that recognition of the of the deep\nDiversity of America play in the car going together of the Senate\n[noise] yeah well they they would not yeah they did the the word diversity occurs in the federalist papers good point [noise] um so yeah and just remember people today people have real attachment to the place where they were born\nAnd grew up in the Michigan you lived there all those unbelievable it's as they used to even Michigan they're attached to yeah yeah but 'cause you know first of all what choice if you got you're going to go to Ohio [laughter]\nSo it's uh so it's a a it's a ... yeah you you know you like the football team from your state and you like a baseball team and all that right and that's just a reflection of something larger you\nKnow yes yes if you grow up\nIn California if you go up in urban California you know where I live a long time and you live a long time then you know God help you\nIt's in some ways very similar to growing up in urban Boston but in other ways really different\nCompletely a hundred percent different because of the freeways and the beach because of the the music and the restaurants because of the ... the fact that you have

[laughter] make across the ocean [laughter]\nYou know and that's just and see just remember we we we forget these days right but we have these bodies and they have to be somewhere and it matters what their surroundings are like and so the idea that you would eliminate that uh would be ultimately to eliminate consent of the government\nI Want to go back to you you said the Hamilton in Madison were originally opposed to the Senate Mary is abroad the argument that the Senate reflects the slave holding interest that is profoundly wrong but it is everywhere\nYeah that that uh the slave holding interest influence the debate but it did not drive the debate and and the way to understand that is a you know there was an assumption and it was very widespread\nThat slavery was going to pass away and that it had\nAnd it did pass in more than half the union and that doesn't mean they weren't exceptions to that they were very few prominent ... exceptions to that\nAnd for the south Carolina delegates are for example a slave holders paint me um you know they they said things in their lives that indicated that they thought that this institution was incompatible with the declaration of independence\nAnd it is so so they're not you know there but protecting their interest is not the same thing as protecting their slaves\nAs one of the big holdout was New York state\nWe're not going to reopen the seventeenth amendment as a practical matter I'm against the convention in those states as a matter as well but when we come back we're going to continue to talk about the glory of the Senate and this current eruption of attacks upon it as an institution not on any particular decision the decision to come from Brett Kavanaugh is a great and good decision\nBut it launched it
