of Stephen Harper I should ... when he wasn't listening you smell listening but I said what he was it I said that he was in effect the Ronald Reagan of Canada\nAnd now I have him on the line to use his book is literally ours have published today or published this week rights here right now and it is his thoughts on what is happening in the world today specifically\nFor dominance of Donald Trump the phenomena and indeed or Stephen Harper the phenomena of other leaders Angie ignoring of a lot of their own citizens\nBut of course I Will let him explain what he's written and just say that it it's an honor to have ... former prime minister of Canada Stephen Harper on the line welcome shirt to show\nHis bank you that and thank you for your very kind words I I Do know that you that it was well it was it off but I appreciate hearing it now at first\nWell I'm Glad you knew it while you were in office that that seems a lot to me [laughter]\nI by the way I just ... just before we START I I

[laughter]\nThere are there are pretty a limited big opportunities\nThere I Would bet yeah [laughter] right and a half [laughter]\n... [laughter] pretty limited to speak you gotta do to do though was your best revealed just they were All right so tell us the thesis of your book\nSo that I wrote the book uh obviously you know from my background that Britain's prime minister but in the context of who rolled by no have I run my own global consulting business in which I one of the things we do it by\nThe clients around the world about political read the book one certainly and how to respond and prepare for that but also I'm chairman of the idea which the global federation of conservative party includes the Republican Party the United states\nAnd a twenty sixteen I had been serving a obviously a theory of\nNew and unorthodox than unexpected electro ... Donald Trump's election boat primary victories in general election victory was the big us but the upset ... Brecht referendum though I was so called populist movements in Europe and elsewhere and so I'm really trying to address what I think is going on\nAnd um and what um how leaders business and political but particularly how conservatives should respond to some of this so that is really the essence of the topic and I get to put my feet that then that show\nWhich some people would find surprising I think the populace I'm as they raised these concerns about market and trade and immigration the globalization that many of their concerns are correct\nAnd that we have to do a better a job in terms of policy we happen to respond to be concerned but the way to respond to them through um you know good a good conservative or spot the concerns answered\nSo let me ask you the the mainstream maybe which of course is almost synonymous with a big oval washed around the world and picked all of these\nAs sort of a nation almost fascism in a hurry and in Poland now Brazil and the United states what is your response to that\n\nAny anybody that that really clearly has no understanding of what fascism\nWas um you know the fascist movement which does exist and some corners and some dark circles or the movement from the Nineteen twenties and I am thirty but at the very different than most of this right wing populism is not to say that in some\nCases there aren't a in some of the extremes there are some similarities but\nUm you know populism uh people you see that on the left I'm liberal media you caught me three me I call it liberal media 'cause that's what it is\nUm [noise] you know they frankly equate anything they disagree with the fact that kind of the standard response\nBut populism has a long political tradition popular but then on the right left and better and popular or people who probably are wrongly are often trying to bring the concern of large math people concerned they believe are being ignored in public they end up with arena and um I think\nThe undeniable whether one at ... for instance with the concerns of are the issues that strict ... rate on trade and immigration the matter is like that there is no doubt that he is speaking for a large mass of the people who are concerned about these policies\nAnd are you familiar I'm sure you are I like just a quick take on hungry and Poland\nYeah look I Try I'm not too I'm a kind of get into talking day to day politics of various member part of the I I'm a I you know I Would say obviously in the case of Hungary\nI'm what I've heard of them support for Mr Bond more than anything has been his ... that's been um to illegal um an irregular migration over his board or something that the population supports them on and that the right to support them one\nWho so tell us a little I I was not familiar with this and then I think it's important for my listeners to know about the idea of the international Democrat union so tell us what one is that\nYeah so it was set up a believe it or not it was actually set up in Nineteen eighty three\nAre under the Reagan Administration um the original vice president George W Bush with the signer of the London back cooperation that established the idea of prime minister about your cats are cold Germany a structure Iraq who I Believe was mayor of Paris at the time but the leader of the\nBetter right in France a day and a number of other leaders I think it was about thirty five at the time came together to form a global federation of conservative party that has\nThat fairly regularly in the decades that followed very active then at some prominent near the end of the Cold War is the leaders obviously coordinated\nTheir policies or you know researching conservatism coordinated their policy that we're all ... very short order and bringing down the Berlin Wall of the Soviet Empire but the organization has continued to spend and by the court is really one way or\nSort of active but and operatives really share best practices on campaigning in on governing so we just had a gathering of a hundred representatives of various eighty parties around the world and and the Los Angeles recently actually\n... so I here here's something I Would love to get your take on\nWhen I think of Canada I I think of a of to Canada as in many ways the same way I think of America is to America as a left in her right is that is that a a valid perception or not so valid um\nI probably would quarrel with it and it doesn't it then there's no doubt um\nThere's no doubt in Canada or of all I Know very many Americans uh conceive of Canada they a very left wing country I'm In fact\nConservative movements very strong candidate you mentioned I upbringing ten years we just had elections recently where and our two largest province of Ontario and Quebec a right of center government came to office so\nWe have a significant um conservatism and considerate movement in our country but our country is far less polarized\nAnd kind of what you would call left right camps than the United states are really a remarkably less polarized than part of the reason I wrote the book\nThe trends like talk about in the book the trend of\nYou know very core economic outcome for a lot of middle and working class people and the political disruption and populist movements we're now seeing they really have not hurting hand at the same degree\nOf my book is not a book and my book really is about it from my perspective why some of the lessons and the practices we followed in Canada helped the boy some of the challenges and how they can help your the conservative movement and I said then I'll flip through\nThe book ladies and gentlemen is right here right now I'm speaking to the former prime minister of Canada for ten years conservative no less\nAnd the book is up at the dentist Prager dot com right here right now and this man is as you could tell was obviously very thoughtful\nAccounting is a very important country in the world and we need to know more about it we need to understand for example the worldwide conservative a resurgence I mean it's happening that's what he's explaining [noise]\nI mean every one of you to do that I spoke to spoke\nAbout the Quebec elections it was astonishing talked about on this on this show [noise]\nAll right every body I'm Dennis ... even for his book is going to spray goes on you know we reserve\nA fairly conservative editorial line unfortunately\nA lot of the day to day reporting and calling this are simply not that bad and in terms of federal federal politics ... which I I Would not today considered the national posed the conservative paper\nIn terms of its day to day coverage in federal politics but its editorial rely line remains relatively concern the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where what an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage\nNowhere to hide it tough yeah you have to ah you have you have\nTo you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists um\nUm and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states will podcast\nUm you know I think there is a big market candidate for that kind of thing to take off what as I said there is a you know thirty percent of Canadians will always vote right of center at least thirty percent bottom it kind of the the the low number\nAnd so that that audiences in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur in the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which for the most part has very little and the way of of outlet servicing them\nWhat about young people or let me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me that the polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada is that ... not to the same degree right\nSo it was but but on the issues they differ ... just as clearly as the left right differ in the United states so is it because the Canadian temperament is just more subdued ... why isn't there that polarization\nI I think the fact that you know I I ... I hate the generalization about our country but it's a fact that\nCanadians have the more civil public discourse than always have\nUm it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be hard core conservative or heart or left liberal\nWould be much smaller and the percentage of the population that would float between party significantly bigger and Canada plots Dana I think the other factor that often forgotten\nWhen people can they can uh when people compare Canadian American politics as we have more than two parties and that really changes the dynamic significantly I always say well you know the strictly two party system you know candidate a hack candidate B. [noise]\nHe can bring candidate B. down in a in a system where he got more than two parties there's always a risk for the candidate a attack Kennedy be effectively the winner becomes Kennedy the who's\nNot all ...

extent possible remains the same stability is a key factor and the happiness of the trial\nBut there is a bigger there that's the overwhelming that's the ... the heavy but there is something the single most important thing you can do is not bad about the other parents have a child\n\nThe number of parents who do bad mouth some cases poison children against the other because they're so angry is very large\n\nUm the most cases I Would consider that evil\nYour anger at the\n... the other parents for divorcing\n\nIs between you and that person the children should be part of it\n[noise]\nThat's a very painful topic about the if there's not a lot because I ... I endured it is a painful topic because I Know how many people have endured it\nWhere kids were act it's cold parental alienation uh syndrome PAAS I Believe\n\nWhere the anger of the Paris so great that they will deprived their child of the other parent because they're so certain about how evil the other parent is going to the fact that the other\nParent divorced them\nSo it's a form of a selfish miss and self centered this that boggles the mind\n\nThat's a very bad thing the children don't want to take sides I haven't been home parents who have every legitimate reason to be ticked off at the other\nWho were aware of tremendous defects in the character and parenting of the of the parents have kept their mouth shut\n\nThey've been say one bad word about that other parents these people of a special place in heaven I'm tempted to say that The Poisoner's of children have a special place in hell\n\nThat's a very big guideline there's another big guideline don't spoil your child because you're guilty but you divorced\n\nThose are my two big guidelines its own poison the child against the other parents\n\nAnd don't spoil the child because you're so guilty I see I see a or you could see this actually could see the way in which a\nParent who doesn't see the children watch the entire time that they are with them so why would you like to do well would you like what can I buy for you they wouldn't have done that if they were still an intact family\nSo here's the overriding\nThat line and this part you are still the children's father and you were still the children's mother that's your all your enough there buddy children can have a hundred buddies but they only get two parents\n[noise] okay when a Prager seven seven six\nEight seven seven to for three triple seven six those are my guidelines very big topic because of the millions and millions tens of billions Schumer divorces but how many in the actual number\nSince I don't know ...

isn't the parents are not happy people\nEvery guard rail has to remain up your ... you still make the bans on your child in terms of behavior is is how you act\nThey're talking about how I can to make

and here you are\nA all these years later I mean so I I have to ask because people always want to know like when when you said you invented a pillow I was joking around with you I guess it would be less here's like as a pillow\nRise to the level of invention it's called I invented a towel or awash claws he really invented the so when you say you can send you invented a pillow what do you mean in

jobs that I was amazed at\nAlbum my producer night when we are voicing our advertisements on this program from my pillow we came up with the with the idea that it's the official pillow or rip van Winkle\nAnd we want you to know that uh we think that's successful so if you want to use that we're not we're not going to ask for much percentage in fact you can have it but I just thought we were joking around that this pillow is so effective there'd be careful because you might not wake up for Twenty years it's so good you might not wake up\nWell into your new ... well it's quality sleep I mean you know the president's got pillows these he worked so hard and do you know when he does sleep and needs to be quality and that you know\nI think he like hibernate the goes way down his his

[laughter]\n... [laughter] pretty limited to speak you got it for two to these I was your best ... they were All right so tell us to see some of your book\n\nSo that I wrote the book uh obviously you know from my background that prime minister but in the context but who ruled by no have I run my own global consulting business in which I one of the things we do it by\nThe clients around the world about political risk and political uncertainty and and how to respond and prepare for that but also I'm chairman of the idea with the global federation of conservative party includes the Republican Party the United states\nAnd a twenty sixteen I had been observing a obviously a theory of new and unorthodox than unexpected electro ... Donald Trump election boat primary victories and general election victory was the big us but the upset ... Brecht referendum though I was so called\nPopulist movements in Europe and elsewhere and so I'm really trying to address what I think is going on\nAnd um and what um how leaders business and political but particularly how conservatives should respond to some of this so that is really the essence of the topic and I get to put my feet to send a nutshell\nWhich some people would find surprising I think the popular with 'em as they raised these concerns of the market and trade and immigration the globalization that many of their concerns are correct\nAnd that we have to do a better\nA job in terms of policy we have the meaningfully respond to be concerned with the way to respond to them is through um you know good a good conservative response to conserve the answers\nSo let me ask you the the mainstream media which of course is almost synonymous with being washed around the world picked all of these\nAs sort of a nation almost fascism in a hurry and in Poland now of Brazil and the United states what is your response to that\n\nBy any anybody who says that really clearly has no understanding of what fascism was\nUm you know the fascist movement which does exist and some corners and some dark circles or the movement from the century Nineteen twenties Nineteen thirties but at the very different beast that most of this right wing populism is not to say that in some\nCases there aren't a than some of the extreme there are some similarities but\nUm you know populism or people you see that on the left I'm liberal media you caught mainstream media I call it liberal media 'cause that's what it is um you know they frankly equate anything they disagree with with that that kind of a standard response\nBut populism has a long political tradition populist but then on the right left them better and popular or people who are wrongly are often trying to bring the concern of large map of the people concerned they believe are being ignored into public they end up with the arena\nAnd um I think it's undeniable whether I Want to read for instance with the concerns of are the issues Mr Trump is raised on trade and immigration that matters like that\nThere is no doubt that he is speaking for a large mass of people who are concerned about these policies\nAnd are you familiar I'm sure you are like just a quick take on Hungary and Poland\n\nYeah look I Try I'm not too I'm a kind of getting Pataki day to day politics of the various members part of the I you know I'm a I you know I Would say obviously in the case of Hungary\nUm what had heard of them support for Mr Bond more than anything that's been his ... that's been um to illegal um an irregular migration over his board or something that the population supports them on the right to support them\nWho show they tell us a little I I was not familiar with this and then I think the report from my listeners to know about the ... the international Democrat union so tell us what one is that\nYeah so it was set up a believe it or not it was actually set up in Nineteen eighty three\nAre under the Reagan Administration um the original vice president George H W. Bush was buying or at the London Declaration that established the idea of prime minister that your chance for coal of Germany or ... Iraq who I Believe was mayor of Arabs at the time but the leader of the\nBetter right in France a day and a number of other leaders think it was about thirty five at the time came together to form a global federation of conservative party that has\n... barely regularly in the decades that followed very active then at some prominent near the end of the Cold War is these leaders obviously coordinated\nTheir policies or you know researching conservatism coordinated their policies that we're all successful and very short order and bringing down the Berlin Wall of the Soviet Empire but the organization has continued to exist spent and my vision board is really one where\nIt's sort of act with it and operatives really share best practices on campaigning in on governing so we just had a gathering of a hundred representatives of various eighty party throughout the world in in Los Angeles recently actually\nSo I here here's something I Would love to get your take on\nWhen I think of Canada I I think of a move to Canada as in many ways the same way I think of America to Americans Elect dinner right is that is that a a valid perception or not so valid um\nI probably would quarrel with it and it's a ... there's no doubt um there's no doubt\nAnd in Canada a oh I Know very many Americans uh conceive of Canada's they have very left wing country I'm In fact\nConservative movement very strong habit you mentioned I cover in ten years we just had elections recently where in our two largest province of Ontario and Quebec or writers that our government came to office so\nWe have a significant um conservatism and considerate movement in our country but our country is far less polarized\nAnd kind of what you would call left right camps than the United states are really a remarkably less polarized then part of the reason I wrote the book\nThe trends I talked about in the book the trend of\nYou know very poor economic outcome for a lot of middle and working class people and the political disruption and populist movements were now think they really have not hurting hand at the same degree so my book is not a book in my book really is about ... from my perspective why some of the lessons and the practices we followed in Canada\nHelped the boy some of these challenges and how\nThey can help your the conservative movement and I said and also with\nThe book ladies and gentlemen is right here right now I'm speaking to the former prime minister of Canada for ten years conservative no less\nAnd the book is up at the dentist Prager dot com right here right now and this man is as you can tell is obviously very thoughtful account\nAnd it's a very important country in the world and we need to know more about it we need to understand for example the worldwide conservative a resurgence I mean it's happening that's what he's explaining [noise]\nYeah yeah the national post um was founded as a Twenty years ago\nAs a more distinctly conservative newspaper and it has maintained\nA fairly conservative editorial line unfortunately\nA lot of the day to day reporting and calling this are simply not that bad and in terms of federal federal politics ... which I I Would not today consider the national posed the conservative paper\nIn terms of its day to day coverage in federal politics but its editorial rely lined remains relatively concern the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where what an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage nowhere\nUh it tough yeah yeah have you know a while you have you have do you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists um\nUm and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states will pod cast\nUm you know I think there is a big market candidate for that kinda thing to take off as they say there is a you know thirty percent of Canadians will always vote right of center at least thirty percent autumn kind of the uh the low number\nAnd so that that audiences in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur and the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which are the most part has very little in the way of of outlet servicing them\nWhat about young people or let me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me that the polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada is that because certainly not the same degree right\nSo it was but but on the issues they differ ... just as clearly as the left wiped differ in the United states so is it because the Canadian temperament is just more subdued ... why isn't there that polarization\nI I think at the fact that you know I I ... I hate the generalization about our country but it's a fact that in eighty and having more civil public discourse than always have\nUm it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be hard core conservative or hurt or left liberal would be much smaller and the percentage of the population that would float between party significantly bigger and Canada\nPlot that I think the other factor that often forgotten when people can they can uh when people compare Canadian American politics as we have more than two party and that really changes the dynamic significantly I go they strictly to party them you know if a\nCandidate a hack candidate B.
