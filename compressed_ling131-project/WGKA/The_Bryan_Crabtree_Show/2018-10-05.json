A. L. A. M. executive editor of National Review\nAnd ooh contributing editor at the Atlantic well very few people get published in both ... salaam welcome to the dentist Prager show\nThank you so much for having me dentist I really appreciate it\nThat's a very enthusiastic response it's usually thank you for having me\n[laughter] so have you done this a long time I appreciate your response so first of all tell us a little about your son of immigrants where did your parents come from\nMy parents come from Bangladesh and they settled in Brooklyn New York in Nineteen Seventy six\nEverybody you know there's probably about ... that's ... that's true [laughter]\nWe're kind of like the welcome mat for\nTheir [laughter] I'm Sorry to interrupt you but it but it was a it was I I just had to because Brooklyn and queens or\nAre the most interspersed populations probably on earth anyway go on so they came from Bangladesh before you were born\nYeah that's right\n... on what what year was that when did they come\nThey came in Nineteen Seventy six and a you know both of my parents they have\nAnd so it was somewhat easier for them to climb the economic ladder that's not to say that that restriction was motivated by purists motives in every case\nBut the upshot is that it gave some breathing room particularly to those working class immigrants so they could enter the American middle class and also their\nKids wind up living in the suburbs they wound up a form of these more integrated communities and embracing an American identity they might steal a you know clean to some aspects of their older ethnic identity but it was more symbolic rather than a lived experience that separated them from other Americans\nI think that that's a big important part of the story\nOf why you wound up having this more unified more cohesive American middle class culture and those years\nThen specifically that there were limitations on immigration in other words that I Want to know if I'm summarizing you're pulling accurately that\nIs much more likely to ensure a melting pot than separation if there are restrictions on immigration is that correct summary\nYes I Do believe that having control having some limits as opposed to having an uncontrolled policy can make a big difference it makes that melting pot more likely to happen\nDoesn't lead on saying we should go back to the policies of the Nineteen twenties but it does mean we need to be mindful of the context in which immigrants arrive in the U. S.\nAlright rents are rising in a in a context of racial division in which your identity politics and identity politics extremism it's going to be a very different\nAll the way back so I was just going to say that's the second part of your title you made the case on the melting pot but your title is melting pot or civil war question mark so the civil war comes when everybody has their own identities\nExactly when you have a situation in which you have people who are fighting over not just class differences but also over ethnic differences the danger is that you might get some kind of group that sees itself as a marginalized excluded underclass\nAnd that the ethnic dimension to that\nAnd then you get demagogue politicians\nWho are claiming that hey wait a second the reason you're in the position is because of the other people with their wealth\nAnd with their power that's why you need to tear down the system that's what I fear is going to happen in the years to come you're going to get this kind of demagoguery today's identity politics will become even more screen he'll get even more\nSocialist politicians will embrace this kind of identity extremely\nLike so I the reason I asked earlier about what language was in your home was I I Do not at all\nPose in fact I'm for immigrants\nTeaching their children the language that they came from I ...

I I I don't want to rely on immigrant parents but go ahead\n[noise] yep I think my parents attitude certainly contributed to it but I honestly think that another big factor with that I was not part of
