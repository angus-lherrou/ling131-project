President Trump's presidency is now almost two years old if you voted against President Trump or you put president personally surprised or argue bitterly disappointed Mr McConnell what percentage of people said that they were ... pleasantly surprised persist bitterly disappointed\nFifty seven percent\n\nActually closer to Seventy percent so that they were ah personally surprised only thirty percent so deeply disappointed about that\nThey're one of their have any projects by what can I have been identified say radio and ... University in this project I Would say but that's really the biggest projects overlook\nBut in terms of sheer work and you know ... there's nothing like this effort to explain to the first five books of the Bible to people who are atheist agnostic believers\nIt's called the rational Bible next volume is probably one of the Bible genesis and it is a [noise]\nIt's really a work but I Hope will I Believe will outlive me and I tend to be here a long time\nThey say that after six book that for every inch that's another three years so that means whatever I Would be six four to twelve years so that puts me over a hundred\nOh but actually that's a very good point or Mr tripled city that a certain point to those ceased to be in effect like seven feet\nSo I have a theory might be your friends that is going to blow your mind okay even the living martyr has not heard of this new theory [noise] it's not entirely\nNew wife made reference to this for decades but\nI have now put it in the context of the current political situation I Believe that we will be seeing more violence from the left and I would like to give you a theory as to why\nI I mean my first theory I wrote up a few weeks ago in a very important column I know it's important because it got just on town hall or should we were twenty two thousand\nBut what is it again why do I forget that we're not forwards or when people pass on some no no no come on guys [noise] shares yes I don't know why it's I think of shares in terms of stocks I think that's the problem\nAnyway I wrote the first reason I Believe that is that the left unlike liberals again the left\nDo not believe that they are obligated to visit to society's rules of of behavior facts Hillary Clinton said that just now did you see that we have we ever saying if we have a clip\nArt or on the way if we do I would like to get it I Want and the Eric Holder ... exactly right when they're down a chicken\n... and they're ... they're down so we take the high road they take the low road and when they're on the low road we kick them\nRight so there there are absolute invitations to violence and of course I mean I ... a a complex term in some ways is it violence to scream with people while they're having dinner at a restaurant\nWho the interesting question if you know the words if you're not touched is there is there all the violence is the only sense that can be involved in violence the sense of touch a it's a it's a question but anyway\nThe second reason this is my new idea the second reason the left will be violent is this I'd like to read to you this actually is is a a\nSomething on site in my Bible commentary in certain ... chapter forty\nSix term is just about out yet coming up sprint anyway so let me tell you where it's from okay\nIt's for three professors Roy ... who's been on my show ranger criminology bread Bush and there'll be peace Campbell in an article called self esteem narcissism and aggression\nDoes violence results from low self esteem or from threaten the ego wisdom\nWhat matters is self esteem ... that's the name of the peace if it was published February two thousand in current directions and psychological science ... it's the journal of the association of psychological science you are you really knew what every couple of years\nYou don't ... you would never let it collapse but it's impressive it is just impressive so why you wouldn't be everybody the the article so these are all professors\nSelf esteem or sisters him and aggression from current directions in psychological science from ... from the year two thousand now I'm going to go to it until you address the simple one\nParagraph conclusion violent men seem to have a strong sense of personal superiority\nYou hear that\nI told you this many times citing boy about my sister\nThat in his study of criminals which is his whole life work he found that that they had violent criminals had fire self esteem than the general population\nI continue favorable self regard is linked to violence in one's fear after another\nMurderers rapists wife leaders violent youth gangs aggressive nations and other categories of violent people\nAre all marked by strongly held views of their own superiority\n\nWhen large groups of people differ in self esteem the group with the higher self esteem is generally the more violent and one\nThat is why the left will be violent and that's exactly right [noise] I uh I'm tying in\nVarious trends that I have brought to your attention throughout my radio career\nAnd his exceedingly important to understand the roots of the self esteem movement they are completely on the left John ... left wing state senator in California I interviewed the man\nI understand where he came from why he pushed for it and California passed that I wrote against it what you could you take a look what that year was California\nDelegated a hundreds of thousands of dollars to the self esteem movement and of course it caught caught on we're even conservative parents started thinking about their kids self esteem as being important\nWhy do you think kids get trophies for losing [laughter] why because of the self esteem movement we don't want our kids to feel bad about himself\nWhy not why not\nYou should always feel proud always really no matter the lack of achievement in your life then what's the point of a treatment\nIf you're gonna feel just as good about yourself if you fail as if you succeed well Bob ... in fact I took those that line straight from the study in the journal of psychological science\n\nThe self esteem movement originates on the left it permeates the left that is the reason normal rules of behavior don't apply you can call the president of the United states a Nazi\nBecause the normal rules of moral this course do not apply to you if you're on the left you are so good you are so rights and rights is\n\nThat you don't need\nTo live by that's by the way that is you don't need to live by ... rule that is the reason remember Amy wax the law professor at the University of Pennsylvania also on our show\nLiterally half of her fellow lawyers wanted her to leave or stop teaching her courses at University of Pennsylvania law school because she wrote that the ... middle class values of self restraint\nThat permeated America from after the war to about Nineteen sixty forty five to six feet were good\nGet married before you have children\nGraduate high school work hard\nTo be a oh this this ... this really drove him crazy respect authority oh my God that drives the left the most crazy you can't tell me what to do police you can't tell me what to do teachers you can't tell me what to do parents the state can tell me what to do but nobody else [noise]\n\nWas as if this is why I predict is this a predicted especially if they lose the congressional elections you're listening to the dentist Prager show one aide Prager seven seven six\nThe different goals naming your child to God and you are part of the family so um I guess we have very high self esteem and I always hot and so someone disagreeing or yelling at me or not agree with me\nIf it's truly something that I blame it doesn't really bother me now I never thought of myself as long as I wrote in any way but I can guarantee you I have a lot of self esteem so I guess\nI wanted a limit on it or you know it's an important subject what do you think of giving trophies to kids who are losing teams\nIt's ridiculous OK so you okay so I have two theories about your notion of self esteem which would be bored with mine one is\nThat there is when you said I Want you to know your child with God I couldn't agree with you more that's not the self esteem that the psychologist to talking about with regards to rapists and murderers and the like\nNot that they they don't walk around thinking I Am a child of God I promise you do okay so I agree with you in that we are all in God's image this gives us a certain ...\nThat is unique to every one of us I I I learned that as a child in my religious school and I believe it\nThe self esteem they're talking about is I Am terrific\nI don't think you told your children you are terrific\nAnd ... you know okay there you are even laughing that so that that proves why point so there's there at the other is you believe I ... I won't put any words in your mouth I'll tell you say I Believe I Believe in er into self esteem I totally believe if you have done well and you have done good\nThen you should think are highly or or well a viewer cheap and that's a very that's a totally healthy thing\nOkay so I think we're on board on that\nThe self esteem movement wanted you to feel good about yourself no matter how you behaved irrespective of religion vest and sell us grew up Catholic got very angry at his Catholic upbringing rejected it this is a secular self esteem yours is religious self\nEsteem I think there's a big difference I don't see a vigil which will Christians going out there\nAnd screaming at the at the legislature tours more pro choice [noise] stopping their dinners they the more likely to ah to pray
