{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "Tell you something initially President Trump talked about terrorists in order for uh for national security member that\nNever mind that we produce most of our steel here and the two other major suppliers Canada and Mexico are friendly countries so the national security stuff was BS and he knows he stopped saying that\nNow if the goal is to reduce tariffs with our trading partners I'm all for in the short run doing something to make them stand out the question is is this going to benefit the American consumer and extra early to tell that\nThe New York times called it a victory for the president and it is but she did as well and it is because the campaign to reevaluate their to renegotiate NAFTA the question is is it going to be positive for the American consumers for example [noise]\nNew York times points out there for the first time the new agreement mandates that an increasing percentage of parts for any tariff free vehicle must come from so called high wage factory\nThe women says oh factory was pay a minimum sixteen dollars an hour in average salaries for production workers that's about triple the average wage in Mexico right now and the assumption is that division will force automakers to ship supplies from Mexico or Canada to this country\n[noise] but there was to that automotive Alice had warned that the provision could have a damaging effect for Americans quote by raising costs for American car buyers and incentivizing automakers to move production to low cost countries outside of the country like China so we we don't we don't know yet\nAnd I want to find out more about it before I determine whether or not the president has done the right thing with NAFTA was popular among the base especially and now that the Bernie Sanders has become a anti free trade and um the Republican Party also anti free trade are both parties now have pretty much the same position on trade\nOne more time this is about consumers and tariffs\nIf they are designed to protect industries that are that are failing all they do is prevent the business people from doing the kinds of things I Need to do in order to make those businesses competitive\nAnd if the idea is to retaliate against or the other countries for so called dumping products on us dumping simply means of other companies are are being subsidized by their government\nThey're not making money but they are being subsidized by government and and if that's stupid why should we will retaliate by doing something equally stupid I still feel exactly the same if however the\nCanned it is to cause our trading partners to reduce their terrorists in our goods\nOpening up their markets for our manufacturers inspires that's good but if ... if result in higher prices to the American consumer explained to me how that's a good idea\nSo it's too early to a a do a victory lap as far as I'm concerned I Want to find out more about it anyway thank you very much for ah for the call appreciate it triple eight nine seven one S.

Ronald Reagan I don't know if you remember he would have drinks with the speaker Tip O'Neill years ago obviously and at night and he said and what you were were ... what's going on in the daytime me so that's the daytime\nWhen he fought him tooth and nail now of course you can't have a drink anymore because that is now disqualifying if you were on the right\nIt has become all out war\nAnything and everything goes\nNow lying is kind of place you know with a Senator Harry Reid and write Romney's taxes someone told them that even pay taxes and later on he said well you know it was effective right that's the issue is it effective not if it's true or the total insanity of the charge\nThat Kavanaugh was part of a group allowing for women to be gang raped or not gang rape the least about what they're doing standing in line they are extreme that supposedly\nSo much so that even the New York times wouldn't print that accusation but all of it is fair game\nAny after ... is to be treated seriously if it is made by someone on the left against someone on the right stuff those are the rules so the salt but Keith Ellison I think he's running for lieutenant governor in Minnesota He may very well have made against his girlfriend\nIs he's running for attorney general it doesn't matter who said she was telling me the attorney general it it doesn't matter do salty did against his girlfriend iffy dish but he's on the left\nAnd maybe even more telling he's a Muslim which you if you didn't know is an exam group these new rules only are for those on the right\nThe ends justify any means we're evil and they are right check that correct they'd never want to be called right but that's all that matters there is no issue of whether they can go to sleep at night but you know ... they care because they know they're doing God's work\nIf they even believe in God and their God is more likely to be the God of left isn't or an anti conservatives are into a Republican is that is their religion and it doesn't matter who they destroy there is no negotiating with these people it is their way or the highway\nI have trouble watching their allies this past week even though you know it's the talk show host to have to watch that circus\nThey didn't really care about that woman not really she was yes senator Booker I Would have said you know she was used as a pawn because because those on your side would have ignored a conservative woman with the same charges against a left this man you were using her\nAnd your accomplices of course in the media would barely cover it\nMade I mentioned Kathleen Willie Paula Jones Anita Broderick the list actually goes on and on\nThose women women sorry weren't on the left so it doesn't matter they're just road kill on the way to power I Sean I learn roadkill in Texas that's that's a phrase they use their Juanita Broderick right right right\nThey actually hypocrisy of people like Cory Booker talking about sexual molestation\nI'm surprised they didn't have another Spartacus moment wasn't that at a sporting his feet like didn't he admits sexual misbehavior or the self righteousness of Kamala Harris or the other ... on the panel they talk about taking the high moral ground\nThese hypocrites have actually reach new lows alone ... moral\nAround every time I can think they go you know but it can be lower than this they break new ground\nTell me that is my first question to you how you were able to contain herself I Won a prayer seven seven six these people's disgust me I Can't watch or listen to them in fact what I did was I was teaching part time and so every time a Democrat got and I knew I had to listen but I kind of work this out a little bit\nI I it's hard to take it's really hard to take\nKavanaugh was not even my first choice by the way to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered if the pope was Trump's nominee and he has left us make no mistake about it they wouldn't have been against him it doesn't matter if Trump appointed him\nBy the way why didn't have to they need the range of future FBI investigations when they know how they're going to vote they already know\nAnswer to suffering people like Jeff Flake\nTalk about being name correctly you know as soon as I heard his name I have some doubts he said if you remember he would vote for Kavanaugh and hysterical woman confront him and he admits that was part of the reasons he was for an additional FBI investigation can you believe that\nJeff Flake is a fool this delay will not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats it will further divide us this is all a show to delay the process so they can get in power\nLindsey Graham hadn't just right\nThis is all about power and I and all of us probably could take it more easily if they just what they felt but they are a bunch of phony hypocrite left us who disgusts me\nTell me what you think I Want to prayer seven seven six but it's worse than that because we now have taken away one of our most basic rights\nThe presumption of innocence you can charge anybody with any crime you want and you don't even need to have corroborating evidence it doesn't matter if they're innocent you can still ruin their lives\nAnd there are no consequences for the accusers because it's very difficult you have to prove that they did it with mouse\nTo remember a Reagan sector of labor I think his name was a sector Donovan when asked\nAfter he was found innocent as some charges I don't remember the charges anymore after he was found innocent they said to me about where would you go next to what are you going to do now and he said something like where do I go to get my reputation back\nExactly where pray tell me does judge Kavanaugh will go to get his reputation back\nIt's gone now at least for a lot of people and the Democrats and the left have ruined his reputation and some like Feinstein had the nerve to question his belligerence and demeanor at the hearings what was he supposed to do Senator Feinstein after you help destroy his life\nAct ever so serene as you ruined his life\nAnd his life of his family and his Dennis has pointed out we're is his bank account for all the good work is done for all these years\nHow did Bill Clinton by the way stay is president after what he did with the complicity of use Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate this was not a good week for American I Want to know what you think that one a prayer seven seven six and I can see the borders are already filled but you know I I go to calls pretty fast\nNow we're going to get close to break but as for Christine Ford do I think she was attacked\nYes she appears credible in that regard of I read something about Dr Thomas old saying you don't confuse the motion with the facts so yeah she was emotional unbelievable but are you know hard maybe getting in a way\nBut the judge Kavanaugh commit that attack I doubt it very much especially since no one can corroborate her story she doesn't know how she got there how she got home when it was exactly by the way one she tells the others at the party\nOr anyone else for decades for that matter\nTo you know did you was you allowing a friend to be may be right by those boys also\nI mean there are a lot of inconsistencies in this stuff or if not inconsistent questions so now we've reached the stage where oh you need or allegations so I think it was this westward and hundreds of people from now on making accusations installing every nomination they don't want and everybody's reputation in the process\nNow now there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accused accused and accuse it's a new democratic strategy that has now worked\nI Want to know what you think when I Prager seven seven six I can see you're just as unhappy as I Love you know I think mark Iceland sitting in\nFor a dentist the dentist predator show from the relief factor paying for you to the [noise]\nNot the right word no but I you know it's\nDifferent than the other thing that I I Want to mention is and I've not heard anyone say there um when they asked her about her friend Leland and if she would cut from there um she she talked about the present well she got some health issues and I'm going to respect your health issues\nI'm thinking about this as a former fourteen year old girl even before cellphones back next we'll end what are called her and said you know she is I think I'm remembering eight miles from home\nWell I should get home one of my friends and\nYou know I didn't she didn't she tell her that she was reading or at least give her a car and say you know what happened after I left or any of those kind of things that they're able to hold her testimony that I Wish someone had jumped on\nJet were you disappointed in the prosecutor also asking those questions I didn't you think like I did this going to reach a climax and\nI and I kept thinking yeah I mean you know when it came to the new drink and then she was done my heart sank because I thought boy oh boy this is called the record they\nGo you know you were done for\nAnd I was so proud of Brett Kavanaugh when he came in guns blazing and anybody that you know make fun of him for crying or for bringing up his daughter pay I guess what are ... ... what would you not do it you were accused of something so horrific\nWell yeah and but you can't prove a negative well of course and you can't win because if he had been calm they would have said well he was accused of all these sort of you to do but not find something and the other St Louis to belligerent to be a justice if she can't win with them that that's the point you did it will thinks Ukraine culture you you can't win with them\nHow could you win was um it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what the truth is\nCan't win with these people's people's people thank you mark six that let's see some other great calls let's go to um well we're going to get that break Amy ah\nThis is just this could be brief in Columbus ohio you're on was mark\nI'm art high anything you need high I just wanted to make the point really crack 'em I just thought the other day I'm not sure whether it happened or not but one thing I think if I was in ...\nI Would be focused on the person that was the opposite of what was going on in\nThe lap pool laughter or whatever she said just go work I was so terrified it's good for the girl that I Would focus for a person that was on top of the\nUm one hundred percent so but the other thing was quick I Can't I Can't remember where I thought\nWell I'll do it for just ... minutes that break you were saying they set up and go find me a cap and I think they did let me know what you think when a predator seven seven six mark I

you're on was mark\nAnd mark Hi\nYeah I'm art I haven't heard anybody on their own doctors hoard statement [noise] she was talking about going to help her with her husband and they were doing to remodel owner all into remodel up like she said yeah\nAnd she had requested a second door [noise] and her husband and wife to hurry so why would we need to do on the front of the al yeah and she clearly my statement that\nShe was afraid that one day that boy that attacked her mafia Supreme Court justice and take out oil when they were making that ... [noise]\nYeah but what's what's your point I thought you had a [noise]\nI mean it's like it's funny that she would put that wall would like to believe that that would be in ... in her statement something back in the gas and oil white carpet when he would have been doing\nWell but he was a as a federal judge you know the circuit court or whatever they call that the the district court he was being considered for that previously so maybe that's why she brought up\n... you know even the whole thing with a ... you know so many years later they're going to come back and attack you show her answer would be let me defend her now that she was so traumatized by this whole incident that that's the result that many years later and I think we need a punishment room for this because it's not a\nThat she describes her current during the last ... for men wearing pop\nSound Grand Turk let's do it on my own in Connecticut very specific Nineteen eighty to catch Kavanaugh so that's another lie letter why was she was flying out your regular freighter why well that's ridiculous she and her husband fly all over the world but that was another line\nAnother language hide the fact that her brother\nHas their relationship what Peter\nI'm it\nPut a little bit below but only three people were low so I think that that needs to be investigated this law yeah no there's an awful lot about the woman that was very emotional\nI think that women really relate and emotional testimony mhm and they find it hard to back away from it but it was not factual well\nDid you hear about actual questions were not done\n... did you hear the code ice kinda paraphrase what Thomas ... said that you can't confuse the motion with facts right she was really good on that emotional level right and and a lot of women especially but others related to that but you just sit\nThere but that has nothing to do necessarily wouldn't it being factual Carol to go go to your job now okay\nI Know what is Sean was just saying to me that people are so affected by this or even if President Trump doesn't seem to be as emotional you guys are said oh no see what happens he's a good man is a fine man\nBut this was really upset him since the OJ Simpson trial maybe were struck tabs on for Larry Elder one day when the the strict testimony happen I mean this is really hitting people hired by the way the response all this is you got to come out and vote you got to come out in such big numbers\nThat it it makes a huge difference is not enough just it's great that you know give me a chance to express your feelings about what we we can't let these people get away with it and since I mentioned Sondra in Florida go ahead sundry you're on was mark\nWhich is not an object describes a radio on\nSo that's a delay me there ... okay I got to chew on hold because it's going to really make you crazy if you listen to the radio a jak in Annapolis, Maryland Jack you're on with mark jak yes\nMark thank you sir a there's a point that seem to be being I'm not talked about and that was at the beginning of the question of Dr Ford she was asked her how she found out about the party and she said that there was a pool boy attendant or a friend that was at the pool and told her about it\nAnd and she ended up or you know going from that information\nShe was asked who that person was\nAnd she said she wanted to keep that person anonymous\nWell I think that's a key point from the fact that there is an individual out there who can tell\nI held the party and we're the party was because that person told Ford weren't was now I understand the anonymity but this is very important point we have someone who she identified who she not willing to say who is who can place her at the party\nAnd back on her ... who held the party\nYeah I I missed that part I was probably teaching at the moment but if that happened I it seems significant to me if you have someone who can ... your story at least place you they're right and in fact maybe he knows what had happened where a lot better than she does right that doesn't make sense everybody seems\nTo be focusing on how she got home but I think we need to focus on how she identified that part who were the party was and who was in the sand to be an individual who told her exactly that information or we should be able to find out who it was then cocaine corroborate the whole thing or cannot [noise]\nYeah it's you know it's really scary Sean\nThese guys are doing a better job with the questioning that Michel ... where are you guys are asking and stuff has been some of it may be a little off there but\nUh I I I thought that was fair game also and the ... one of my friends of tennis at the me something about how to cheat she said she could people couldn't hear it but yet she heard them laughing there's so many things that\nOne could have asked her about it maybe we'll call her in the inconsistencies but it seems like they treated her with kid gloves and they didn't treat cabinet that way um let's try Steve Saunders ready now because we're about to hit the brake against Sondra\n... great you're always Marco\nLock out or get money I recorded and then we watch all that money I Know that\nGuy and hold hold on to 'cause we're we're going to hit that break a let me know what you're saying one a prayer seven seven six mark I still filling in for Dennis\nNews opinion inside am nine twenty see a\nTarget is pretty good here for ... at American federal rare coin and bullying for years I've been recommending precious metal dealers\nBut I wasn't

A. O. L. dot com Dennis will be back tomorrow which may have you've done over the years and I appreciate that very much\nAnd you can also keep in touch with me on Facebook or Twitter at the ... show and you'll find out where else Cy pure besides filling in for Dennis or Larry or whatever\nIn the last star talked about the Supreme Court the Kavanaugh's nomination hearings and how despicable many of the Democrats and the left we're in our in many of you calling in stay there I'll Try to get two and a little bit I just want to for some other ideas out to you\nI Want you first to consider the importance of a quote that my one of my brothers share with me from our second president John Adams here's the quote\nIs more important that innocence be protected and then it is that guilt be punished for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished\nBut if innocence itself is brought to the bar in condemned perhaps to die than the critics will say whether I Do good or whether I Do evil is immaterial for innocence itself is no protection and if such an ideas that\nWere to take cold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever that's partially what's taking place that's uncalled by the way\nThe Democrats I threw out there know what their unleashing do they care they're destroying one of the basic tenants of our republic\nThe presumption of innocence they are asking for trouble they're also asking for trouble if they want to go back to high school and check everybody's teenage years\nWho among us is so proud of those years and where's the bank account of thirty five years if he even committed what he's accused of as a teenager I thought we at least the left I thought they believed in redemption and they get the left\nThat wants people to be forgiven even those who commit capital offenses\nBut now the teenage years are in play and maybe soon part of that the junior high ears and by the way I Believe you confess to some sexual assault ... senator Cory Booker during those years how come you were still in the Senate\nAnd I thought Joe Biden plagiarized while he was in college how come he was vice president\nAnd senator cotton tweeted senator watch this I knew about this but here's the tweet senator Blumenthal lied for years about serving in Vietnam which is all you need to know about his courage and honesty maybe he should reconsider before questioning judge Kavanaugh's credibility\nEven the New York times reported that this is me now Blumenthal has said he served in Vietnam when in fact this is the times when in fact at least five military deferments and eventually landed a spot in the marine reserve where he used was ... was eventually guaranteed not to serve in the conflict itself\nSenator Blumenthal ask Kevin off he was familiar with I mispronounced the Latin false listening you know false us in on the bus which is a legal principle that dictates jurors can rule a witness to be false and everything if he says one thing that is not true [noise]\nExcuse me senator Blumenthal but that does that also apply to you or do you have a six different now for lying\nI watch these hearings and I felt like I was living in an alternate universe\nTell me if you felt the same way if you were on the other side I'll take your shoes and the other side I Want to get calls from people who disagree why it all makes sense do you want to improve your seven seven six now another thing I Want you to considers this\nIn my home state of California I suggested on Facebook\nThat Senator Feinstein deserves consequences for her do publicity and Republicans should vote for her opponent who may be further less than she is like knowledge that my brother another brother suggested this to me because what difference will make whether a leftist is replaced by a far left as\nI remember years ago comedian Mort Saul said that voters are often given a choice between Tweedle dum and Tweedle dum are\nNow it's much less innocent than that and what's the big difference between a choice between left and far less\nOne at least he's telling you where they stand and going for the kill all at once\nAnd the other is a phony torturing you slowly but surely\nThat Senator Feinstein California's going down the tubes anyway so why don't we let them get their quicker I live here so we might be able to pick up the pieces sooner some day or maybe if they as they've tried to do they can succeed and form their own Venezuela here\nRemember Governor Brown thinks global warming is the biggest issue we face and he is the sworn enemy of President Trump\nSo let them go to the left is utopia and let's get the pain over with what do you think of that idea let's get Republicans to vote for senator finds things far left opponent and give her some consequences for her to push city\nTell me what you think of that I did too and when a prayer seven seven six\nIt's time we realize we're in a civil war with the left for the soul of this country\nAnd you can tell me what you think ... up the phone number that I just mentioned to you and just listening if you didn't hear the first hour the\nEmotions the outrage that this was captured or to the American people like nothing else I don't think maybe since the OJ Simpson trial because maybe your people out there starting to realize what we're in that the lie and they'll do anything to destroy somebody\nAlright I promised I go to your calls ah let's go to Tom has been waiting forever Tom England or you're on with mark\nMarket is great to hear you substituting so to her for that is\nLike and talk to you again I really miss your old Saturday Night show a few kilometers down the dial\nWhen you you gotta check face because I Do other

those we arts\nBark when you call Jeff Flake or pool there's only one thing wrong you're insulting fool [laughter] ah I read you know\nThe Democrats have fallen into such an arm ... Gary\n... lead the moral of when you disagree with them you're either no matter what\nThey foster would constantly\nThey just they have the constitution\nWe ate the free market it's personal with them we know that in the socialist state of California\nAnd they are lovers of socialism which is the government crushing people in the most viable way just look at the end of the way law and mark my fear is if we do vote them out as you suggested we must\nThey will get a scramble whoa almost in perpetuity on Supreme Court they will do anything they can to push\nTheir freedom killing socialist agenda and the future of this country is the one great vast you know we set our founding fathers created will be forever gone\nThanks Tom and you said a very well I can I can feel free to say this Bill Clinton's line I can feel the pain out there in the in the obvious and let's go to a I like Josh in San Antonio's question or comment go ahead Josh\nHi Michael sure\nYou know I just wanted to basically say that uh you know in my own reaction any way to the testimony early or testimony which I think a Republican may have gone at it a little bit\nA wrong angle I think maybe that they won't when you come up you can't really question anybody's memory without coming off a little bit ... especially in a I'm a when a victim you're talking about budget they that they should have basically just said hey we understand that you're that you're you've been going through a rough time\nAnd do you and your incredible without questioning that at all I think that what they should have done it that if the if there was a terrible situation where somebody brought you evidence or brought you in a in a legit accusation but no evidence what would you do and then giving her that often you would have no no chance\nOther than to say that what happened is that it requires Robin evidence in order to destroy somebody's life if they could have gone around to that then they're going to be like oh we need your help to bring some evidence that there is any evidence and then from there you wouldn't have been accused of not remembering\n[noise] I I like your style that's that's that would have been a good way to do to Los you may have different or lawyers who knows and they would have had some objections saying she's not here to answer that kind of a question I don't know you never know what but it by like your approach thanks a lot of trash\nAnd I knew you had a good comment there let's go a little ... can you be really ... in some ways even though you know how I feel Jan in Marietta, Georgia you're on was mark\nHey mark thanks for taking my call sure just real quick ... one of the thing there are many things that I I\nThink that I thought for a doctor forward and her testimony but one really important thing with when she picked like after they decided that attack 'em that she saw a judge\nThe friend that was in the room and did not help her and laugh hysterically up out what what's going on\nAnd she said when she saw him he was very uncomfortable when she said hello what in the age girl\nOkay we'll give you a little question of being ... for [noise]\nThe courage is not there there's flake cause someone a costume wherever it was an elevator on the floors in the Senate whatever starts yelling at him he admits that was part of his decision to suggest that we have a another week of the stuff I mean we're where's the courage Democrats would give them credit for one thing they circle the wagons and they fight for their own and they know the battle or in\nThat's been the problem with the Republicans do we really know what we're up against for them this is war this is their religion this is their God for many of them a lot of them probably do believe in God that's not my point\nI'm just trying to say this is everything to them who gets on the Supreme Court because they've been using it to legislate\nAnd I understand why you're so unhappy a someone says something about the less than I Am maybe they dropped off into waiting over an hour but let's go to Trisha in Denver, Colorado Colorado Tricia you're on with mark\nHi there Hi Trisha

himself in trouble with his tweets but he's like the first person to really stick up for what he believes in any you can't push 'em down you know and cut them off\nOr any actually says what he means kept himself in trouble a lot of times but isn't that what makes them so enduring isn't that well we've been crying out for instead of these mushy Republicans and and a little ...
