Chicago I met a lot of great people but um we just started Chicago guns matter here and uh\nOur objective is to educate as many people as we possibly can on their fundamental constitutional right to keep and bear arms but as I started to step out and\nPeople noticed who I Am I started being invited to some other events and and one of those events that I was invited to was a the D.C project mhm\nAnd I was invited by loving at black well and I wanted to thank Diane a mother and look back welfare inviting me it was fifty when they walk them every state went down to watch in D.C to speak with their legislators has gone on us\nAnd it's rare that ... get the opportunity to voice their opinion and a positive manner\nBecause we see so much negative energy about fighting um ownership or someone is always calling for more gun control\nAnd I'm as that project came to a close a little bit later I Want to say about a month ago we have to DC project at the opportunity of being invited to take part in a debate with time magazine\nAnd with time magazine\nYou know it was a a big\nProject it was a gun debate about guns in America\nAnd I want to thank band mother my D.C projects sisters who took part in this time ... lack of same project as representing themselves as gun owners they had the opportunity to tell their personal stories\nThey told they found the hearts they had the ... the passion to go there not knowing if they were going to be well receptive to accept it\nBut nevertheless it was a gland to project they did well they did great and for all the people that went there to represent\nScholarship or the the secular left side of things because how often do you get\nTo tell your personal story what happened in your life and how it happened and have someone to portray it in a moral or land on the front page of time magazine and I think that's used for us that were invited that we're able to go out and partake in this because nationally\nGun ownership in America don't often get to see the positive side of things you know what I'm saying\nSo you ... you know that was that was a huge I'm Glad you brought that up because I'm going to be talking about that time mural cover in the next several with their W. R. Hawkins also but let me point out to listeners what what it is wrong just talked about what she said mural\nThe cover of time it's actually a piece of art done by Jay are the artists and what they did was they pieced together two hundred and fifty four people from all sides\nOf the gun debate all sides everybody from Shannon watch all the way over to to ... and are good for you even get to ask you on this thing and when you hover over\nThe digital version their silhouette pops up and you can click on it and actually listen to their story is quite fascinating now I'm going to have to go through as you know probably go up to two hundred and fifty four of them and I will\nYou know and that is going to be it's going to be quite the project but I thank you for bringing that up now we got about a ...\nYou know I just wanted to get at our air because you know it it was a great thing and it's rare that gun owners or to a support is get the positive energy that they got from this because those women and those men went there and put their heart out you know they told their personal stories\nAnd and they don't get hurt as often so you know big up to that because we and two thousand uh nineteenth D.C project will be back and watched in DC so I'll get to tell you more about that later\nYeah and you know the fun part about the time was a lot of people that you've never heard of before it wasn't everybody that you see or hear like me on radio and everything else it was a lot of regular people out there\nThat are telling the story again from both sides and it is quite vaccinate I'm looking forward to going through the whole thing round with about another we've got about another minute Chicago guns matter the ... the website is great it's Chicago guns matter dot org\nYour pictures up there and it talks a little bit about you so I Want to encourage listeners to make sure to go over and check out Chicago guns matter dot org and you're going to find out a whole bunch about what it is we're talking about here today know round it did you do we I don't want to miss anything did you have anything else you wanted to cover with the next minute before we have to fly\nA\nLittle cross breed ... studio [laughter] or ... you know the right to bear arms because at the last former defense against here and we're making the second amendment by him a very strong supporter of the second amendment\nInforming than ever training responsibly arm citizens from coast to coast here is your host farms American radio bars walls or\nA\nWealth of them who armed\nAmerican radio [noise] this is a this show is flying right along I'll tell you this hour anywhere near like the last hour the segments were just flying by someone should make sure you buckle in okay going to be an awful lot\nAn awful lot of content being covered we're going to move very quickly to that want to read a comment first let me start with this kind of as I opened up the previous our case you missed it I'll start with this I did a\nNational radio program in Great Britain today it's it's not that I Do a lot of those on the BBC and and the international interviews after something like this happens they kind of reach out to me that have been very friendly to him over the number of years so and I certainly don't mind doing I Love talking to the British people most of them feel exactly the way you do\nIt's just their elites mountainous at the top\nThat doesn't they just simply don't understand Americans freedoms and you're not going to convince them otherwise but it's fun to go round and round with especially when you know you're gonna get ambushed\nParticularly because you've been on with this particular host before in the past but uh the article after my appearance on the show is titled it may just press without a new LDC leaving a leading Britain's conversation\n[noise] Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter now see the light of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Kevin McGuire spoke with mark Walters passionate supporter of gun rights and host of armed American radio to get his view on your mark seemed adamant that stricter background checks\nWouldn't help the situation as quoting me a background check looks at the background it doesn't look forward mark pointed out that he could name thirty mass shooters in America\nWho had all past background checks quoting the again if a madman wants to get a hold of a gun you can in America it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very complex issue mark and mark went on to claim that a ban on assault weapons is not realistic and even claimed that he bought his first day our during the Clinton assault weapons ban which is true\nIt's easy to knee jerk reaction and say my God we have to ban this in reality that's not going to work because they can't be banned\nThey are already here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their firearms who have done nothing wrong and that's the vast majority of Americans I said as an American gun owner we hate to see this were the ones that want this to stop you claim\nHowever at this point Kevin seem to lose his patients referring to gun supporters who have recently spoken out in defense of gun laws in the U. S. Kevin responded that the fifth of Americans with schools are intimidating the full this that do not\nKevin ended the discussion by telling mark oh I don't want your thoughts and prayers anymore and he hung up on they didn't say that and then he hung up on the edge of the interview and apparently unbeknownst to me went off behind my back\nWhich is proof positive that you won the argument because these guys can't stay in the kitchen they like to go to the sandbox they they can't play with the big boys so the videos on there if you want to go see it just Google LDC\nKevin McGuire clashes with us gun rights supporter and take a look at it I put it out on my Twitter page if you want to see it at a A R mark at a A R mark what's funnier than anything is to come down below\nFrom Martin Palmer some who says this cabin isn't in Brazil and rude ignorant wonder if that the American was polite courteous and gracious throughout you have to present you got so angry after thoroughly losing the argument that he slammed down the phone and went into a tirade behind his back\nIt made me ashamed to be from the same country I Am disgusted by this present or\nBy the way what on earth does American gun laws have to do with us here in the u._k. shouldn't we just bought out it is it like the u._k. is such a fantastic place crime is through the roof and there were more murders in London last year than in New York so\nI I enjoy reading that because I just thought before we went on air\nAnd I think it makes for great fodder to open up this discussion right now with a W are hawking from Breitbart News who I\nThink will agree with me and some of the things I said you can actually listen to a minute and forty two seconds it was much like your interview but he was thoroughly crushed eight of you are welcome to the show my friend so did I say anything in there that\nUh that you felt was untrue about background checks are assault weapons or bans are confiscation or anything like that\nNow you're right you're basically stated comics his positions and uh just the truth is in a ... they can handle it that's the bottom line they just can't handle it\nThey're not open not only the one individual song about but the whole of all they're not open to the fact that they're wrong\nWith it and it's not just as individual not talking about Brits were talking about every every left you to think the way he does this guy's got classic American leftist socialism disease a truly does\nA and it's it it was fascinating I I've I've clashed with the guy before and I hope to do so again I appreciate them having me on the show it's an awful lot of fun and I like when they get so angry that they can't argue anymore you know they just they get so ... that they have to hang up the phone and and then you know talk about behind your back because they can't win the argument\nOn the ... now let's go to Pittsburgh for a minute or two or three or four or five however many you want to cover a W are\nWhat went through your head when you saw this as someone who covers this every single day and winds awards for doing so what went through your head when you first of all the news on Pittsburgh\nImmediately a like a treat them as we look like it was going free [noise] and uh so it's prime target or you know you get a lotta people congregated\nIn a place where you're at a school workplace church where there is no armed protection and uh the God I'd have to worry about anything I think they said he was in charge of twenty minutes if I'm correct [noise] uh that that you know um [noise]\nWas the first thing that went through my mind and I'd say the next thing would just\nFeel horrible for the fame like\nBut you know the last talks all the time about how they get tired of the stores you get tired it's happening where you need to an ... Alex or they will say I get tired of it happening too\nI get tired of law abiding Americans living their lives in areas where there's there's no there's no good guy with a gun and uh that's what has changed my opinion that's what that's what was on my mind at the end of the day\nAt the end of the day I look back on what Trump said which I covered\nAnd then I thought he did remarkable you know he did it you're going to the eastern wish we had our security there and he said I also want to speed up the death penalty so that when people do these kind of thing they know they're going to die and they're going to die quick and I think I think\nI think those are the two logical approaches to this from this point you don't ... don't send in a place where there's not a good guy with a gun don't be the good guy without a gun on a lake or\n[noise] make sure you're in a place where there's armed protection and due call your senators representatives let's gets lost change so that people do it the the liberty of living on death row for years and years on welfare guilty and they have their appeal that's it kill him there's no reason\nFor taxpayers have to find some art or his life and that's what a life sentence ends up being at\nCalifornia you're listening on a number of cities right now you're listening in Sacramento right there in your state Capitol you're listening in Southern California you're listening in the bay area\nMy gosh ... a death sentence in California is nothing but we're show that just simply window dressing and you're paying for it you're paying for that\nAnd I I don't know that it even bothers people out there anymore I really truly don't but it's interesting because I can use this as a Segway now to your first piece that I wanted to talk with you about today\nPerfect just works just amazing how we're able to do that on this program Chris Murphy mocks Trump for wanting armed security in places of worship Chris Murphy Chris Murphy is a gun hating valid lunatic left this socialist from Connecticut\nMocks ... for wanting armed security in places of worship go ahead and take it away before we have to go to the break\nTold me that it's it you know and they tried to be ominous he said Trump aunts ... he said he won't semi automatic ... a gunman with semi automatic rifles in every school and the restaurant and go to Tom does want any such thing\nNow but he used the phrase semi automatic rifles just be like ooh and make ... scary\nBut guess what if you had had an awkward officer in the sand that go with a semi automatic rifle\nHow grateful would we be right now because we have eleven people here with us that are gone and who would be dead one animal that deserve to die but managed to live through it and that's why the little semi automatic trades doesn't bother me at all in my truck for warning warning on protects you for innocence\nBut that's not going to be a sign will be a winning ... Democrats so I Hope they'll keep pushing it\nI Hope they do too and ... all kind of throw in my little exclamation point on this as we head into this break at W. R. because apparently Senator Chris Murphy\nAnd uh you know again I Am not trying to say that police officer did that but uh this is where we are society you know people use the wrong terminology\nAnd I guess we're all guilty of it from time to time you know I had the interview with the dopey McGuire over there and I can't comment dopey guy you know Houston titled was opinion and we fought on the radio we go back and forth and we don't like each other and that's what makes it fun so but\nYou know I I catch myself to you know it's impossible not going to sit here and try to correct the guy on the phrase out due the terminology when I've got four minutes on a radio interview because then it turns into a Piers Morgan type deal\nAnd it just disintegration I Want people to hear what we're trying to say but you know I Know somebody out there right now is screaming at me ... if it's not an assault rifle make sure you call it that we do we attempt to do that all the time sometimes there are even bigger place that we have to get out without turning the argument away which is what sometimes that would do\nAll right you know let's let's move on from Chris Murphy he's just as a lunatic\nAnd he's a hypocrite and he's also very he's very dishonest man is what he is but we already talked about you have another piece law enforcement synagogue attacker legally owned his guns I think this is important for one reason because doesn't that go\nThat headline alone says it all I W are that's what goes to the heart of why we have a right to defend ourselves because we understand that\nEvil exist evil chooses the time and place to become evil not us but and we have a right to defend ourselves from it because we are powerless to even identify it aren't we\n[laughter] true true\nYou know there's there's something I'm trying to call ... turn as hard as I think what I write\nI I Know what I Do I write news but also on in my heart to educate people [laughter] and and there's a corner I'm prone to turn where I can somehow get people to think about the fact that there is no substitute for freedom I'm not trying to because I Am\nA it's very simple gun control is not a viable substitute for freedom and if you think it is that you didn't pay attention Saturday or you didn't pay attention to Parkland\nOr you didn't pay attention to Santa Fe high school a Cape twenty eight page or you didn't pay attention at the church in Texas November fifth one Seventeen I keep going but a gun control is not a valid substitute for freedom because gun control priest poses that if we limit everybody's freedoms\nAnd certain crimes will go away it does not work that way what happens is we limit my ability to exercise my God given rights you put me in an unnatural position\nOr pet I've been a member of the congregation on Saturday I would've come under fire and the senseless and somehow we have to realize that lesson that we can't do it every time we embrace gun control where we ... we're saying this for good substitute for freedom talks there is no\nGood substitute for freedom there is not one that works and that's where a framer went out of their way to Hitchens second ...\nWell said I'm not even going to ... that is the explanation point about a perfect place to take a break you know I got to say this on another note that when it comes to\nArming like I'll be ...

R. M. U. D. armed ... eight seven to two and again PSA here for you don't do it while you're driving smarter than that that's why you listen to the show a W. R. Hawkins let let's go to\nWhat you wrote about a student's bill of rights\nFor safer communities and I read this in in its entirety I'm gonna go do each one with you this is the stupidest thing I think I've ever seen in my life and what it is is just a bunch of people getting together to put something on paper and feel like they did something I Can't think of any other reason for this can you\nKnow no it's it's you can tell who's written a kid it's ignorant\nEstablishes school safety committee whose meetings are open to the public at every school equally\nCompose the student's parents and faculty so ... safety committee I don't know what that means they don't tell us to provide immediate access to qualified counselors and safe spaces well good lord\nFor students of all demographics at all levels of education off case you didn't realize that this was coming at you from the left you big left hooks all you had to do is look it's safe spaces was that a giveaway to you too\nRight [laughter] yeah well I mean this is laughable it gets worse so that's the worst\nPart it does go here encourage all school personnel to foster positive relationships at all levels of education okay provide professional development around mental health awareness and interventions were students parents in fact we provide professional development around mental health awareness I don't know what that means to you by chance\nNo I don't I don't think they do either\nOkay but it sounded kind of important the way it was written number live require cultural competency require caught and listen to this careful require cultural competency\nAnd ds elation trainings each quarter for law enforcement provided by the local police department in conjunction with equity training organizations and companies a\nBoy you want to tackle that one\nWas just stupid it's more the left shit what the left doing the police the bad guys they're the ones they learn how the ... the escalate no this I rarely do I see a police studio work like that also really messed up normally you see a police video they tell the guy put your hands up\nStay still don't\nGo down moves he stands up puts his hands his pockets screech for something to get shot\nAt just how that works like a ... if you're that ignorant or the you know should just you shouldn't be in a car driving around with you may have a chance to the gate you an officer 'cause you're obviously to ... to to talk to him so yeah this makes police look like they're the calls the problem and that's a clock to classical left his position\nIt certainly is and it was a giveaway with cultural competency that was the give away right therapy for the rest of that or whatever it is [noise] excuse me as I fight the cold I Apologize right now\nIn the ... one of the things they're cultural competency see they don't since they're left is they're not capable or thought a but if they were they'd have to realize that whose culture do you have to be competing in they didn't find that because it does that mean the cultural competence a competency in\nThe culture that we see in Saudi Arabia where I've only hope we can go out is or is it the culture in another Middle East company\nCountry where women have to be completely covered only their eyes could show is that going to be competent in or do we need to be competent in a culture where they they don't love the Lakers but they the Lakers I mean what's culture they talk about the they want it because they want to be multi cultural embrace everybody so who decides which culture camp that's another mess in the states\nIt is and it's a great question to ask and one that they won't have an answer to if you were to ask them that no one asked them that in the meeting where they discussed is nobody brought that up\nThat's why it's there but you know something else I Want to point out about these police officers too that maybe these kids might want to think about and that is sometimes like happened here in the state of Georgia last week sometimes officers simply approach a vehicle and get shot and killed\nAs there are approaching the vehicle sometimes that happens sometimes is Georgia State highway patrol officer pulls a vehicle over on interstate Seventy five and gets shot at\nIn this case had an opportunity to fire back sometimes officers were murdered in the line of duty before

argument doesn't matter but I just shovel Mali that paragraph and they say look I'm only I'm thinking like you and they're just take it you know and I I said while ago\nThat this was written by kids or and I made almost satellite because written back ... I shouldn't have said that some kids are Nick but these kids are the kids who wrote this you can tell that they've been educated about people who just passed one class to another because they don't even know how to use all I watch\nAnd done it in a left wing fashion then fed them left wing ideals\nAre reduced to go back that up the velocity around I I had\nA number eleven you're going to require universal background checks before all gun purchases eliminate loopholes by connecting local state and federal databases of riveted purchaser require a minimum mandatory waiting period of ten days to purchase virus and raise the age to purchase a firearm from Eighteen to Twenty one with exceptions were responsible training like military service\nInforming hand Andrew training responsibly arm citizens from coast to coast here is your host harms American radio bars walls or\nIn\nThe White House welcome back to the show we're going to be talking with John lot in this hour that will be fascinating Sean's reaching out to him right now and a boy I gotta tell you man oh man it\nIf flown right by new that was going to happen today I knew it I told you at the beginning of our one that the show was going to move right along to make sure to buckle and of course great gas with Alan Gottlieb and our one followed by Ronda is out\nOf the itself the Chicago to resolve the Chicago case has really taken it to Romney manual\nAnd fighting on behalf of all law abiding Chicago gun owners gutters around the country\nNo we we get sick and tired of these people slump in their their noses at us when they're defeated in courtrooms in Chicago has been the tourist with that for many many many years of course Rhonda zeal wasn't going to take it\nAnd as a result won both of our cases was great to have her here and also of course a W. R. Hawkins and the second hour where we went through and had a lot of fun with him to going\nThrough all of his writings at Breitbart of course I opened up the ... both programs or excuse me both previous hours with my surprise call I got this morning from\nBritish radio and Kevin McGuire show over on LDC obese I guess that there's an obesity let me just double check and make sure I'm getting the right one a it is a yeah L L L BC\nAnd Kevin of course a very popular journalist and longtime radio guy and journalists and pundits over in Great Britain and he says anti gun as the days long I've gone round and round with them before\nThey called me out of the blue or Fifteen minutes later I found myself on the air with him earlier this morning and as expected you knew he was going to try to copy from lesson that's exactly what he did he can't stand my responses and he he can't argue and of course he did what most liberals who lose arguments do he got mad and\nHung up on me and then attacked me after I was off the air with them apparently and I know that from reading the column that made\nSome news over there to there was a column Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporters do read it\nKevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter and down at the bottom you'll you'll enjoy the column and there's also a link to about a minute and twenty four seconds of my segment with him I played it in the first hour and then at the bottom is a comment about how the host was incredibly rude and ignorant and then after I thoroughly\nDestroyed him in his argument slam down the phone and went into a tirade behind my back and\nOf course the commenter also mentioned that I was in the the American way of course was polite courteous and gracious throughout and you know it's interesting because I've done a lot of British media over the years a lot some of it some of it the attack ambush style stuff from others they genuinely they they're fascinated\nBy our quote unquote what they refer to as our gun culture in America they simply do not understand it and that's understandable from people who have been disarmed and now a generation removed in Great Britain\nAnd this is what they always warn us about gun rights supporters in Britain have always warn me over the years and saying was in Australia which got to realize in Great Britain now there was a new generation who have never known the right to bear arms in Great Britain at all from the time they were born\nAnd those people it's not unusual to have them a little flustered by our culture and many of them are fascinated of course others are just haters they're out there but it was a really fun wild fast moving two hours and I guess Sean were good to go now right we've got John on there so let's go now to Dr John Lott\nAuthor of many books more guns less crime and the rest of them I'll let him tell you and of course a frequent guest on the radio program and someone that you see talking about the numbers and crunching the numbers and talking about the same things we talk about here\nBut in a little bit more methodical and economic way to present these numbers as fact John welcome to the program always a pleasure to have you thank you for joining me today\nGood talking to say I know you've gone round and round with some of the Brits over there and their media including Piers Morgan you ever get frustrated by um\nNo I mean [noise] uh I guess I've just gotten used to it over time I suppose as much pointing getting very frustrated by it but you know it's\nIt's kind of wanted to stay animal people keep on hearing the same things so there's no one really to kind of explained the logical arguments to them over there and uh you know you think academia is bad here probably even worse there\nI have to you tend to tweet up and and you're right about that it's it's fun I've I've done some television and radio over there and no doubt in my mind I'll be hearing from them on Monday or Tuesday or even before this day is over believe it or not because of the time she is I wouldn't be shocked so listener I'll keep you posted you can follow me on Twitter at a our mark and we'll put the lens ... just like we did this one\nJohn you end up on your page I it's very important\nAh CPR see crime prevention Research Center\nLike some of your research how [noise] excuse me how a botched study fooled the world about the U.S share of mass public shootings us rate is lower than global average you try to tell that to somebody else did they tell you your nut cases ... fill us in on that what'd you\nWrite well we had a study that was put out a couple of months ago few months ago now a\n... basically we went through and collected public shootings from around the world are we had to hire people and different countries in order to try to help us out on that and um you know it's\nYou know people get the impression of how the United states stand by let's say the media stories we hear cases like a horrible tragedy that happened yesterday and a Pittsburgh uh but we don't hear about cases that have happened and the rest of the world so just this last week\nA there was a large mass public shootings in the Crimea which is now part of Russia\nVery strict gun control laws there and uh uh they had a school shooting at a college student went and shot up the place a shot to death Twenty one other people and wounded Seventy\nBut my guess is a very few Americans heard about a story I mean that one got more media attention then ... it\nIt sort of ended up look students around the world uh you know or if you have a big school shooting in Germany\nOr you'll be lucky to get a you know one minute brief on the news on that and that will be it and they'll disappear or the Europe it's much more news coverage and mass public shootings in the United states and\nUh we'd get in the ear even gets on other attacks and other countries in Europe [noise]\nAnd uh you know as the big the news coverage has a big impact on people's perceptions of a of you know the rates at which they say their prey so I'm not surprised but that's resulted\nIn our paper in our research we go through and let the cases for all the different countries so people and they list all news sources so people can go and check those things themselves if they go to our website at crime research dot org a click on the button at that\nUpton says research they'll go down and among our various research projects so the uh the the the data and the project that we did on mass public shootings around the world\nYou know CPR she original research I'm On the page by the way listener and I I Want you to go there when you as soon as you get a chance it's real simple crime research dot org crime research dot org and when you click on the research button which aren't that many many times you will see CPR she original research and it is just filled\nWith data that you can use for whatever purpose just for your for just because you want to gain the knowledge maybe you want to answer a question maybe you're preparing for a debate whatever the case may be it's all here for you and you know it's interesting John\n... since we're gonna get ready to take a break your second\nBut when I see these numbers\nAnd I look at this the first thing we get hit with and I have before myself is along the lines of a dozen happiness frequent as it does in America you got the highest homicide rate in the nation it's crazy around the world and that's not true when we come back\nAfter this break coming up maybe you can address that\nAnd I what brought that to my attention was a tweet that you put out earlier today\nShowing with Ninety six percent of the vote counted Brazil's extreme right wing candidate was won the presidency with a large fifty five point five to forty four point five percent margin old Chicago style economics in a country where the homicide rate is five times ours\nHe supports people carrying guns particularly for women for protection John we've got just twenty seconds that shocked a lot of people to hear that there are countries who have a higher homicide rate than ours because they think we have the highest homicide rate in the world but with with just about five seconds that's simply not true is it\nNo I mean well well below the average were below the media and in terms of homicide rates and there's even problems comparing homicide rates across country is going to go\nYou know these guys have such blinders on with regard to this you know as you say it's common sense to me but I was chief economist for the United states sentencing commission I must have read through a thousand trial transcript and I have to tell you\nNo one can read through all those criminal cases and not come away with the view that these criminals trying to pick easy targets\nYou know they may be kooky or dumb or whatever but they're not so stupid that they don't try to pick easier targets in the same thing is trust\nWith these mass shooters\nThey made me crazy in some sense but they're not stupid they want to try to kill us like people as possible so they want to go to a a a venue where they know victims are going to be able to defend themselves because they know the longer it takes\nFor somebody at the same to live with a gun the more people that are going to be able to kill\nSo yeah I guess I Am frustrated but I'm frustrated because\nOn one side they seem to think that they have all the moral authority that they're they call for laws that either no beneficial effect or actually cause harm you know these gun free zones one example of that and yet\nWhen a when these attacks occur they want to posture as all people who are willing to do something while my responses yeah you're willing to do something but let's do something that actually works let's do something that actually matters it wouldn't make people safer\nYou know there's so much meat in what you just said I could take the rest of the hour without ... quickly I'll go to a point out the media when you were talking about the media\nThey won't because it doesn't fit their narrative that's why they leave out that portion of course you know this was some talk to you what you heard John Say about the Kroger shooting we're going to be talking about that on our director radios daily defense tomorrow in fact and probably on Tuesday as well but as John ... when it out on his Twitter page\nAnd you can follow him at John are locked junior on Twitter by the way to get all this information in real time as he puts out it's a great great Twitter page but he points out stuff and I was doing the same thing a B C and they just eliminating the fact\nThat he white concealed carry permit holder and the attack and he goes on to tell you in a tweet and it was comedy weights doing it that he wrote about how the headline could be totally different\nHow it could be white concealed carry permit holders saves black from should I mean it's just that the media narrative your listener is what drives us we've talked about this together for so many years and it is very dangerous the way the game that they are playing and the way the media handles this for a lot of different reasons when we come back\nI Want to ask John's opinion about what the Pittsburgh mayor that and I do want to go back to the homicide rates in where we stand will cover that I promise we'll get there\nWhen we come back with John ... from crime research dot O. R. G. crime research dot org we'll be back with Dr John ... right after this the next half hour is going to be a good one is moving right along buckle in back after this [noise]\n\nThat Philip brought his little brother on our mission into orbit\nNow I Can't believe how easy it was a project for filing for my car insurance for bank how\nMuch down down down I\nBelieve that guy go could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance\n\nMessages that are required by taking the roles were returning to listen to Nick and Vicki story about the quiet\nDuring when Perry loud and ... draining can be next to somebody who you're trying to sleep and we've got that Loughner reverberations\nYou're always hoping she can get to sleep before I come up because I\nStarted getting the point where I was concerned 'cause I knew she wasn't going to get much rather see if I came to ban the same time you know she's been so used to me by on all the others to try and she was kind of scout you'll say oh okay oh there's another year and you're going to even try and I said no I really read up on this and I'm I'm going to make an effort over the summer\nAnd I'm trying to ... to her great for us I'm happier person in the\nAnd I think that carries turn that hand yeah that's the best way to describe the clients and\nSee quite works for both men and women Texas sleep see two four six eight ten or go to get the quiet dot com try and risk free for thirty days were just nine Ninety five Texas sleep to board said they did or go to get ... dot com today\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nProbably been about ten years ago I had quite a few credit card the interest on the cardinal is really high I was making the minimum payments but barely and it was just getting to be too much though I called trinity if you're into\nThen you need help coal trinity up one eight hundred nine nine oh six nine seven six to talk to a certified counselor they met\nWith me and they were able to get all of my credit cards and one lower payments\nSenator he will consolidate your accounts to one easy to manage monthly payment put a stop to late season over limit charges reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nSaid it helped me learn how to manage my money now you know we have a house and we're doing\nA lot better if your dad has your down coal trinity you have one eight hundred nine nine oh six nine seven six\nName is Holly and I am debt free for kids\nOne eight hundred nine nine oh sixty nine Seventy six\nPat Boone here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now Saddam\nTo release factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain quite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to aging exercise\nAnd everyday living and let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking it was nice long walks or\nPlaying golf for tennis you can't really call it and living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor maybe all you need to lower or even eliminate these pain\nWhole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know and the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start and\nThen not only Nineteen Ninety five and go on to order more [noise]\nLet's see if we can get you out a pain to go to relieve factor dot com\n[noise] every body buckle up [noise]\n[noise]\nOf wheat body buckle up [noise]\nA lot goes on in the car but you know we're in control so let me move when you hear the click that says they're buckle they never give up until they buckle up and learn more safer car dot Gov slash kids about Columbus message from the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the council outside\nTrying to answer whether overnight lows around fifty wand with clear skies out there Monday is looking great funny guy heightened you're in sixty nine layer on Monday Night clear float around forty by some of the ... and ...
