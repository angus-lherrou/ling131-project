and the and the big them talk show guy turned it into you personally you just meant that you feel that America hates the migrants are\nAt it and so I'd go to Canada yeah I well you're right about that\nBut here's the interesting thing so it's a fascinating premise if Canada we're right here alongside us similarly susceptible to a Mexican invasion or a Hungarian or whoever south of their border

some of my colleagues if the Salem review\nAnd it continues\nAs I test out airlines on a daily basis here I'll tell you one thing that I Do get a chance to test brought traveling so much is\nIn the market for an SUV for the first time in my life and what I Do is I rent SUVs and it's it's a nice way of testing out SUVs\nAre the real road for a day so that's where my ... that's part of what I have been doing\nSo as the the ...\nThe press is the media or preoccupied with these bombs or these make believe bombs I'm not even sure which are bombs which are make believe bombs which could work which wouldn't work none of them did work\nThank God obviously nobody has a clue who was sent them and yet we have the following\nAs a given from the media when I'm On a plane Mika Brzezinski or for you from MSNBC\nOne point that is just worth making\nI don't know if in a free society I'm In a in a police state you you might have this but in a free society I'm not sure in fact the perceptions of reality among\nThe two halves are between the two halves of the society ideologically has ever been as different\nFor all intents and purposes Mr Brzezinski him I Do not live in the same society we did not live in the same country one of us is spectacularly wrong\nAnd it it it it's really it's a sobering assessments one of us is staggeringly wrong it's not an a new launch thing to listen to what she has to say\nAnd then they'll tell you what I have to say and you will decide or at least conjecture here she is today um MSNBC\nBut as a Democrat I with the team now and say that ... that\nI Want to be outside the highly reactive Atlanta ... about this president and I've shown some of that even this morning\nWe don't have to pack a day but I Do now in my heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that ... that top Democrats in the ... what the target had\n\nWalked watches the what was the inevitable rhetoric that top Democrats would be targeted\nNow I Know what they'll say about media and ... you said that the ... amendment of the people\nNow if I could have maker Brzezinski on the show this is what I Would ask her I Would say\nI'd like to establish where our perceptions of reality begins to defer when they have to start at some point would similarity so where do they fear\nSo for example do do you what your knowledge that\nIn the last two years since this president has nearly two years since he's been elected\nThe fat\nPeople on the right have been far more harassed including politicians than people on the left\n\nThe candidates I've read to you folks were candidates have been pushed or shoved or punched or where they have been screened that curse that\nI I don't know of any parallels with regard\nTo left wing politician right\nIn ... that is a Republican House members were shot at and by sheer great heroism and luck none were killed no democratic congressmen have been shot at in these past two years since he was elected\nPlus ... why is\nThe mainstream media lightening\nOf Donald Trump to Hitler\nWhy is that not a coal to violence I don't I don't\nWhen I say I don't understand most people say when they don't I don't understand they're really saying I disagree I Try to be really precise so when I don't understand I don't understand I don't understand\nWhy your side would not regard like giving the president to Hitler\nAs a coal to violence\nWould not be obligatory on old Laurel people to kill a Mason Hitler\nI I Would think it would be personally I [laughter] if somebody could have assassinate Hitler in the Nineteen thirties the than a\nApproximately fifty million innocence would have been saved\n\nWould have been one of the greatest act to goodness in the history of the world so I I'm not quite understanding how you can call us white supremacists which is a horrible thing it's a it's an it's truly Nazi like\nAnd you are your side some out was capes charge of fomenting hatred\nThis is what this is what is\nPart of what I Believe ... or almost daily is the author or lack of self awareness on the left it is it's an immaturity it's truly a immaturity is a major feature\nHops them complaining in gratitude all the features of a child will be found among leftists\n\nAnd one of them is a lack of self awareness I can scream and rant and rave complain call people every epithet then if there is one answer to me I scream bully bully\nYou are you who who am I oppose are sexist intolerant Xena phobic homophobic Islamic phobic racist bigoted but I in no way for men Tate\nI Can't even be considered as a hate mongering because I'm On the left just as the left teachers that no black can be your race has been including Louis Farrakhan for example\n\nThis is the world in which the Mika Brzezinski is live it's it's it's a fairy tale it's a it's a fairy tales not good because they they are often positive it's to make believe could choose to make believe world and you can't fight people who live and to make believe we're\nRe taxes on the fall Baghdad to fall back on the ball back you name it\nWhy isn't that big coal to\nViolence what are you supposed to do with people who are who are that bad\nWill greet them with hey how you do in the hope here but a good day what are you supposed to do well or why does that count as creating a a an aura\nOf evil around people on the rise I really want to hear I I'm ... I'm so curious 'cause you know if you were on the left there you've differ with me even if you're on the right I Will treat you respectfully\nTell me why does all of that rhetoric white supremacists neo Nazis Nazi like this is the Nineteen thirties I read to you from the new\nYork Review of books from the Yale professor a scholar on the Holocaust\nAll the parallels that he sees to that it was a piece of garbage was intellectual idiocy from a from a Yale Holocaust his story he gave Holocaust but he's a bad name in that piece\nBecause people are young people who don't really know about the Holocaust reading all all that's what the hell out of the Holocaust\nIs the United states or the Weimar Republic is the United states today oh that wasn't that\nTop Democrats in the navy out what they targeted [noise] now that Trump won before the midterm brawl\nBattle of conspiracy theories on hold to act\nLive away forgive me hold on I don't want is that means a battle of conspiracy theories I I I'm a I'm not arguing with her I I don't know what does that mean a battle of his\nConspiracy theories versus left wing conspiracy theories if I talk that clearly I really don't deserve a radio show this is not to insult\nTo if it's the whole left those that they make these massive charges and I I ... I don't know what they're referring to what does that mean a battle\nOf conspiracy theories is it a conspiracy theory a does she think it's a conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in a in the last election\nI'm curious what she acknowledged that that's a conspiracy theory but I Know you haven't heard much about that lately have you\nWonder why\nWhat if it turns out to be essentially nothing\nIs what will happen nothing\nLeft lies dominates the media for a year or two with allies they turn out to be lies and then they move onto the next lie that's the way it works there is no shame one of the joys of being on the left is never having to say you're sorry and they were feeling embarrassed\nThat they have dragged this country through this fraud of Russian collusion\nThe leading the most is dean of the left wing media the New York times the Washington Post ABC CBS NBC NPR PBS\nAnd nothing it turns out to probably have been nothing will they apologize you ... are you kidding you are kidding go on please\n\nThey're asleep areas on hold to accusations violent behavior Democrats\nDown trying to eliminate Republicans from ... ... when that public places like restaurants don't do it [noise] tactic\nExplicitly encouraged by Maxine Waters don't do it don't they do say that hey we can stay several and dealing with Republicans like Hillary Clinton say we should pick Republican the former government\nOfficial said don't do that and that got her with the flow and this rhetoric that's why they want they want and during that Brett Kavanaugh

the more conservative on during government and more conservative what a mall and government not only to placate that and create some harm there but all the time it with the U.S elections on and to create\nA ... and I got older I got a lot of questions here so I I happen to know by by sheer will Bush totally sure chance I like a turtle up to no but I did go down to Honduras at the time with his lawyer a controversy\nOr when she tried to install himself under the constitution and installed himself for another term as president\nAnd the ... the Supreme Court of Honduras and the Congress even his own party said that this is an untenable\nA book the he or she persisted and maybe your friends and then was kidnapped admitted it was it was a remarkable time and then um during history so my first question is what\n... what does the left in a in Latin America half the game would this caravan\nMay be more and I want to be more precise may be the miscalculated it seems to me and I think to a fair number of Democrats this is only helping the Republicans\nAbsolutely\nAnd I think there was a great miscalculation um you know especially if they were trying to affect\nUs election or U.S policy and for example was ally in Honduras and and you get a great explanation of that history with ally and it's basically an ongoing war with the current government and it's basically this continuous battle with the current government\nBut the destabilizing Central America stabilizes our ability it it drives risk in our relationship we saw that they you know the United states government and the Guatemalan government have a very strong relationship but when you have this well a migration\nComing across their border and remember they're much more like the European Union a lot of people in the United states don't interest\nAnd that but Central America allows people to flow freely from Honduras Nicaragua back and forth you know can vary a theory that Central America on it so they can't really judge close the border down if people have their paperwork\nTo let the Guatemalan government was doing while I was there is they had buses ready to go they were claiming to the people that are United States is not going to let you in that the Mexican government that this is a very dangerous journey and their words have children there that they had been lied to\nPlease hit on the bus let us get you back home let it get you back home safely now of course the organizers of the group we're talking against that now we're moving forward we're going forward but Guatemala was able to actually return nearly according to their their calculation\nAround thirty nine hundred to a four thousand people back to Honduras\nThe problem however Dennis with that once the caravan started moving moving through Guatemala moving to Mexico and moving into Mexico more and more people were joining in so now you have it swelled to estimates right now are like fourteen thousand\nCreating a potential problem for the U.S as a move towards the border which is the reason why the department of defense today under a James Mattis is now looking at a point eight hundred troops to the border on to the U.S border in order to stop\nThe penetration of these people from coming into the United states should be some kind of turning it remember catch women and children which of course are going through it very treacherous track\nThrough these countries um and and you know they he at ... and everything else that goes with it ... to their own physical body and the criminality that's contained within the groups I mean I never did that and is Thirteen\nAnd within the group that came in across the Guatemalan border we don't have background on these people that are coming in or if they're from or or
