{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "Uh the glucose monitor back several years ago we broken that barrier technologically wise now we have a system that requires no calibration and\nReally know finger sticks at all so once a patient puts this on this is their glucose management tool and it performs to an accuracy level\nStrong enough to support that what that means for a patient is life changing ... it's so many fewer steps a day for somebody with diabetes it makes a disease much less intrusive much less\nAll consuming because you got all your information right there in front of you all the time and you don't have to go through the painful singer sticks and so that's the first feature a G six the second one that is almost every bit as revolutionary at least at the start as we've redesigned the entire mechanical system a A R G six product and what that means is\nIn the past and they use our system the insertion of the the censor it looked like a big surrenders that was inserting enter into your body and it was a little scary\nI I actually saw that intimidating and it was like well what the heck I mean it was it turned out to be very easy and not painful and so forth but yeah it's a little intimidating at first\nWell what we have now is a system that is one button to push you feel the tape off the bottom of the sensor put it on your body push the button and you're done\nAnd and the patient never sees a needle doesn't feel anything at all uh as that sensors inserted\nThrow the plastic away and you're off to the race is the system is has a lower profile so again a smaller as we look at our new products as we designed products and do things our first to focus has our performance to make sure that it works\nSecond convenience to make sure patients can adhere to the therapy and get the information that they need and then third we try and pull ... out of this thing over time as well\nAnd one of the new system looks very elaborate due to the new insertion device and the\nSwimmer transmitter we have pulled cost out of this\nOvertime in patients will see ah the result of of those engineering and design efforts\nOther features of the sexes labeled the last ten days instead of seven days so patience or a ten days\nWhich again is more convenient for them there's a new alert and that has been introduced into the system called the predicted low alert so in the past our our alerts we're focused mainly on a hard numbers that as you cross a certain threshold that little are you now have an alert that that when you turn on it\nIt will tell you before you get to that low number it's going to give your prediction hey\nYou're going to get down to fifty five and X number of minutes do something now\nAnd then we have and not only is that revolutionary very very intuitive and in and and that's helpful informative\nBut really kinda cool from a technology standpoint I'm thinking well there's kind of a whole new algorithm that allows you guys with your research and development to help lead patients no well ahead of time\nTo prepare if you're going for example low and those with diabetes do exactly what we're talking about those with the family or friends with diabetes also can relate\nAnd it's so much more important to be able to know ahead of time to take action you know maybe a you know go and get that drink you need a soda or something you know have have the meal a little earlier than you might have whatever the case because now it is predictive\nAnd you're able to get that much needed information again without the finger sticks which is revolutionary right there I said you could probably could have stopped their people you talked about the new system and most people would have said I'm In because that will write it right away makes such a difference in people's lives\nWell I think all all these features combine or creating a new experience will enable us to broaden this technology and sort of a larger number of people and and benefit their lives and so we're we're thrilled with similar thrilled with what we've heard from the initial user group\nAh we've done a limited launch which you're obviously part of Dave and then gotten very good feedback and and now it is all systems ago so we are a shipping to a patient says I speak and uh as a patient scalloped there'll be migrating ... five system as they had in the past\nNow do you live as I understand it is a a acceptable for Medicare is it not\nG. five is approved for Medicare and that and you know we gotta Medicare purple back in early two thousand Seventeen and it literally took his eight to nine months to work through the bugs while\nGetting product to our Medicare patients uh the Medicare population is are very well might as technology we have filed gee six foot the appropriate reimbursement authorities and what expect their approval ... six before the end of the year and we'll be able to get Medicare patients on a new system as well\nSo that and that is a great patient population use for this technology\nFor sure well if you've got diabetes you're done using decks gum shame on you you should be but if you are a
