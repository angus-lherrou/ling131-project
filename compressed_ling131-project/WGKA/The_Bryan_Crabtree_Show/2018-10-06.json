last several weeks we've had a number of the lawyers from Elias defending freedom on the program including a lawyer representing jak Philips he's the guy that owns the map to peace picked shop [noise] jak by the way it's now been targeted again he's back in court again\nAs is Atlanta fire chief Calvin Cochrane he's a career firefighter serving in a bunch of position over a long career in both local and federal government agencies his record as fire chief for the city of Atlanta\nOn blemish until get this working on his own time off hours he wrote a man's Bible study big deal right got fired ... definitely turn to alliance defending freedom\nNo American should live in fear of being fired because of what they believe it's unjust\nAnd it is unconstitutional my attorneys some of the alliance defending freedom in that scene ... filed a federal civil rights lawsuit on my behalf to vindicate the God given freedoms every American is guaranteed on the United States Constitution and the federal law\nWelcome indeed every body and there was a cloture vote in the U.S Senate to be in other words a vote to put the vote [noise] um the justice\nUp for vote [noise]\nYou cannot closed debate and cloture it's cold\nAnd you cannot extrapolate necessarily from that vote to how they will vote in actuality\nSo you can vote for cloture and then vote against Brett Kavanaugh so it is not a given at all in my mind that he will\nBe\nNominated by the spot or chosen ratified confirmed by the U.S so there's not a given\nI heard and I have to verify heard that a Republican senator from Montana it will be attending his daughter's wedding he's walking down the aisle some Saturday\nSo that would deprive the Republicans of another vote already Lisa Murkowski she even voted against cloture now it's theoretically possible she would vote for covering all having voted for cloture but it is unlikely\n\nI just my heart breaks for the man and I don't know what else I can tell you\nI have made my case from the beginning that it did not deserve the U.S Senate hearing\nYou cannot make a high school accusation that there's never been made against anyone Republican or Democrat with zero corroboration and have the United States Senate close its functions and an entertainment\nYour charge\nIt just it wouldn't be done with anything else\nYou know we uh we we saw him in gay I saw him engage in an armed robbery and high school\nI think they would have stuff for US Senate for that hearing a fully credible person I saw Brett Kavanaugh engage them armed robbery armed robbery when he was a junior in high school\nAnd guess what I can mainly the people who uh who saw him do it then every one of them says I don't know what the person's talking about including one of them who is\nA best friend of the person making the accusation\nSo why is why does the why does the U.S government shutdown why does the U.S population preoccupied with one charge from one woman from high school thirty five years ago why and we all know why\nBecause we live in the age as stated by a professor Alan Dershowitz\nAt Harvard law school a lifelong liberal Democrat Hillary Clinton supporter we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism that is why\n[noise]\nI I don't and he said it's darker it's darker period than that and this is a liberal Democrat but one of the only honest ones you want to really liberals with courage liberals are not leftist but they are but they are very weak\n... except the case of the rare case of Alan Dershowitz who has told me personally and on film to me you will see it in my movie without 'em ... next year\nThey have said to me that he is far more afraid of the left than of the ...\nWell listen to it and see it was all it took her ... she was like\nThis is the this is sexual McCarthyism right I mean think of it ladies and gentleman I Wonder if somebody had said he committed murder in high school whether that would have been a hearing\nI doubt it you have any corroboration you have a dead body you have witnesses\nNo and no on all counts I'm Sorry murder is the worst thing that a person can engage in nevertheless we can't stop the engines of government of the United states of America because one person makes warm I'm corroborated charge of murder\nTell me where by analogy is by analogy improper\nTotally tell tell me you are listening tell me why this happened on what grounds were the hearings held so this is what I this is what I said from the beginning I was attacked by conservatives\nWashington Post National Review and elsewhere and I maintain that my original position was correct all these conservatives do\nUh is feed the beast yes look at what you can\nDo to ruin a man's reputation man who hundreds of women\nOf all backgrounds and of all political\nPersuasion Z have affirmed it's such a decent man\n\nI I'm not sure that I have witnessed something like this in my lifetime and we've had this before with Clarence Thomas or Clarence Thomas ... who is still used as a poster boy for sexual harassment\nAt worst he is accused of talking\nA mentioning sexual matters in a conversation\nA with a a was a ...\n\nI I have that for the record I happen to think that it's unwise to do I have not done that and I'm not a proponent of it I but I think it needs to be put in perspective I mean this\nIs is it the statement of a woman cannot even here talk about sexual matters\nIt is so it is so devastating it is I don't think is a is a affirmative a female strength\nI don't defend it but I I'm Talking about how how awful is it in the perspective of the awful most of the people are capable of problem is in the United states of America things are so good for so many people\nThat a ... an exaggerated view of sin takes place I don't mean religious and ... secular ship\n\nBut we are this is what we have witnessed though the closing down of the mushy machinery of government they were willing to go to California\nThe entire Senate Judiciary committee are you aware of it that was their argument will come to you when she said she was afraid of flying they made an offer of going to her whole maybe\nGo or representatives of the committee or not the whole company or some very important to have some accuracy on this program but the one who how what ever the number they were willing to go to her and it is because we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism just as Alan Dershowitz put\nThe issue\nBut I I don't think in real McCarthyism in the actual you were in the Nineteen fifties I don't I don't know I simply don't know I I ... if one person had said about a Supreme Court nominee I Know he's he's pro communist\nThat's after all what McCarthyism is charged with unfairly characterizing decent people's communists just like we have on fair charging of of people a sexual predators\nYou know how many left wing sites called him a serial rapists\nDo magic can be I mean the the man the man must wake up and think God how did how did this happen\n\nRenee Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three or triple seven six\n\nWhat if this is my question to you and you should posed this too if if a fantasy Kevin or relatives or even willing to talk the remember they are ...\nPeople on the left I think that they are morally superior and therefore normal rules don't apply but the rules of truth the rules of evidence\nI Believe women is a statement that truce doesn't matter gender matters not evidence\nPeople go to college and graduate school will say I believe women\nReally I don't believe men just for

seven to for three triple seven six is the number if you take this seriously you can have\nHappier life it just it just doesn't work out for everybody to have every major area a happiness producer\nSo your task if you want to be happy as opposed to unhappy and I this is one of the revelations of my life is how many people really don't work on being happy\nAm I to me that's more amazing that people not working on their health but maybe it's maybe it's analogous\nYou know if if people do X Y or Z they would be healthier and they don't do it because I guess it's hard but maybe it's hard to be to work on being happy so\nIt is what it is but if you want to be happy or happy or you have to understand you have to accept the fact that very few people for very few people this life deliver in all arenas\nOf life that's that's key\nBecause otherwise what you do is you fixate on that which isn't good so this person was a a fair marriage that you know nothing to write home about and ... not worthy of divorce\nUnderstands that there are other avenues oh excuse me I Can't believe it I Can't believe it I missed one\nI should send myself the punishment room but I've never I've never done that I've the punishment room is only earned for carelessness not for content but I don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe content should should apply anyway friends\nHow did I forget that one\nFriends hell marriage I said parents I ah\nOf course children I Know but I I'm thinking I it's the one includes parents in the look if you have wonderful parents it's a big bonus in life is all put parents and\nSo parents children friend's health work marriage there you go if you\nGot 'em on all cylinders that I mean that's like having an all wheel drive\nAnd be and I was thinking of a brand name but I don't want to push any particular brand mainly air but you know what I mean in all wheel drive super luxury s._u._v.\nAlright that's it's not most people can't afford it or just don't have a one eight Prager seven seven six I\nLike you to call it obviously you have a question or obviously if you defer you know if you don't have one of those well the truth is if you don't have health\nThat's a toughie I Would say of all of them that may be my might be the toughest but it depends what health means\nIf you if the health is debilitating or not for example Charles crowd hammer the wonderful late commentator and it was paralyzed almost fully from the neck down that's bad health but he he he was a fully functioning\nHighly functioning more functioning that most people who are paralyzed [noise]\nIndividual can love life [noise]\nRight everybody you've got to find happiness where you can and few people have it in all the ... of life that I mentioned [noise] you are listening to the happiness our second hour every Friday on the dentist\nOf credit and looking for happiness\nWonderful question I my my my answer would be that but you do both you you uh [noise] you can't in other words you can't wait until that success\nFor you to be happy you can say oh when I fix this I'll be happy you have to be happy wall fixing so I Want you to fix if you can\nIf one of those areas or two or three of those areas are or not sources of happiness I Would love to pursue those areas but you can't for being happy until those those successfully accomplished\nSo that makes sense that really it's a very good answer I think it [laughter]\nYou're welcome thank you that's the best question\nIt's they're good [noise] ah I liked that\nOne if you do this is from triple ... want to do with the other person in your life fails to realize this can you be happy with someone who doesn't realize as he told me about a a a a love interest you're talking about a friend ...\nWell I Would answer it let's say even a spouse let's say you have a spouse that isn't on board and in these matters that's why I said then you still\nHave the hopefully health friend's children parents or work and remember or not in order\nTo be sources of happiness this is so I wasn't I was kidding about nine point nine four seven six for three to four seven three six to but I'm not kidding about how important this is\nAnd you can't that's why Julie's question was so important you can't pay this is how people live I'm not happy but I Will be happy when I get a raise\nWhen I have a better job when I moved to ah to Baltimore oh well as a bad choice I'm kidding Baltimore I'm kidding I'm totally kidding don't be offended\nWhen I get married ... I have children when my children got to get married when I Lived right right that's good when I lose this weight that's right yes there's always a wedding I'll be happy when you can't do I'll be happy when\n\n[laughter] that\nThat's the boy did all this time until when that happens is wasted\n\nAnd you don't know how much time you'll get anyway you know people die young just for the record you don't you don't we don't have any guarantees you celebrate what you can\nNow yes it's very important\nThe when issue ... people have that up that I have talked about but not as the when the issue I like that as the when issue I really could do another happiness book [noise]\n\nBy\nI sit here and I do believe this is helping people that that gives me a joint [noise]\nYes\nExactly [noise] back in the moment than his prayer\nDennis Prager show live from the relief factor pain free in the\nNews opinion inside am nine twenty ...

know I'm a I Am an emphatic and tourists are of God and religion as you probably know but\nI I have to be intellectually honest no matter that's number one God wants me to uh to worship him in truth so ... so what you're saying is it's not possible for a secular person to be happy\nThat's correct yeah well not really happy yeah will truly happy is an interesting adverb a I I don't know I don't know the answer\nTo that I think look I I Believe that secularism has produced good government and nothing else everything else it's touched has been pretty much a disaster\nActively look the other way and I and I think that we as parents and community leaders\nHave to take our young people to see this is absolutely vital that we show them what is happening nascent American let them know that it's up to you to do something about this that this cannot continue and the fact that it continues as long as it did how many years was was he operating this house of horrors discuss now\nWhat Thirty years I mean basically Thirty years he was he he you know when he's operating within the inner city and we know that several of those years several teen years no one expected the clinic no one of the department of health\nDecided to to to to you know to do that and that's interesting just what you were saying there Eric you know but people need to know what's going on in the country we one of the parts of the film that we you know where most crowd opened up they think is really important that we all we certainly are very\nVery clear we wanted to have it in the screenplay was you know that during the actual trial of credit card bill you know to abortion doctors were brought in because they needed to explain to the jury what a good ... good legal abortion laws so that they could distinguish between bass and murder\n'em and I can tell you I I I've friends of mine who are medical who are in the medical profession that doctors who who comment on that particular section at the movie\nAs educational to them as alert they learn something they didn't know before one dear friend of mine is the next it's a very highly qualified to work all over the United states of America get knocked no\nSo this is why exactly what you're saying young people get to go because they're going to get an education and it's the other side it's just like a law and order episode you have this you know or some doctor on the stand being asked can you describe\nA legal abortion to the to the jury and I remember failed the night at the very beginning of this process that whatever happened\nThat testimony will be in the movie in the movie script 'cause it's very important to us because we believe no one has ever done that before the movie I think it's a complete first and it's important to 'em and you know when to criticize it because it's it's basically stole it from the actual transcript of the trial you know it wasn't you know what would you know rising there\nYou know um and it was so important um to include that because\n... you know we don't have it where where else are you going to get that information it's such an unbiased and on you know on varnish way and I think it's it's it's quite shocking for people who hear it even people who think they know that subject there'll be quite shocked to hear that ...\nOne thing we probably haven't said because we know the subject so well and certainly both of you do but but what God's nailed did that makes them a serial killer or it's not just of course that he's doing very late term abortions which are gruesome but\nUnfortunately quite legal in America but he was also because he made a lot of money off of a killing children ... that were viable obviously and you describe a described that early on but\nBut but these children would often be born alive and he would he would murder them uh and and that is really why he is behind bars is it not\n[noise] yeah yeah I mean is he he he murdered babies born alive he he murdered his own patients by the way a by allowing on registered on qualified stopped to get the ...\nAnd he also operated up go low um you know he he's serving life and just for selling opioids he also did it I mean I mean the the the legal limit for abortion and in Pennsylvania is an incredible twenty four weeks an incredible twenty four weeks like\nYou know six months she was six months pregnant hop in the ocean however as I wasn't good enough for him heated even earlier than that uh during the week and then on the week on Sunday\nHe did abortions sold at that he didn't trust any of the other members of style to a system to him and his wife did what he called the special cases if he was doing twenty four plus during the week what would you do in the weekend you know nine months and months nine months and that's that's what he was on\nAny new nobody would prosecute him he was quite confident that he could get away with this obviously with the with the with the liberal abortion climate in America and especially in Pennsylvania\nAnd he was right with rights because we know and we know where you're right because we know despite multiple complaints I Love to lots of complaints and in fact they all you know get complaints came to light during the grand jury investigation you know I get\nAll of it no matter how bad things got and obviously I mean it doesn't get much worse than to women dying noticing what inspired the department of health and Pennsylvania to inspect the clinic and you know that's a new reason why people each call ... ...\nIf this can happen in Pennsylvania they century done some backwater not and some other century now back in the dark ages because now it's getting ... and now in\nPennsylvania it can hospital where you live in wherever

[noise]\nWorld of literature surrounding private\nWalk them indeed every body and there was a floats your vote in the U.S Senate ... in other words a vote to put the vote [noise] um the justice\nUp for vote [noise]\nYou cannot closed debate and cloture it's cold\nAnd you cannot extrapolate necessarily from that vote to how they will vote in actuality\nSo you can vote for cloture and then vote against Brett Kavanaugh so it is not a given at all in my mind that he will be\nNominated by a spy or chosen ratified ... confirmed by the U.S so there's not a given\nI heard and I have to verify heard that a Republican senator from Montana will be attending his daughter's wedding is walking down the aisle some Saturday\nSo that would deprive the Republicans of another vote already Lisa Murkowski she even voted against cloture now it's theoretically possible she would vote for Kavanaugh having voted for cloture but it is unlikely\n\nI just my heart breaks for the man and uh I don't know what else I can tell you\nI have made my case from the beginning that it did not deserve eat a U.S Senate hearing\nYou cannot make a high school accusation that has never been made against anyone Republican or Democrat with zero corroboration and have the United States Senate close its functions and an entertainment your\nCharge\nIt just it wouldn't be done with anything else\nYou know we uh we we saw him in gay I saw him engage in an armed robbery and high school I think they would have stopped the U.S Senate for that hearing\nA fully credible person I saw Brett Kavanaugh engage them arm robbery armed robbery when he was a junior in high school\nAnd guess what I can mainly the people who uh who saw him do it and then every one of them says I don't know what the person's talking about including one of them who was a best friend of the person making the accusation\nSo why is why did the why does the U.S government shutdown why does the U.S population preoccupied with one charge from one woman from high school thirty five years ago why and we all know why\nBecause we live in the age as stated by a professor Alan Dershowitz at Harvard law school a lifelong liberal Democrat Hillary Clinton supporter we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism that\nIs why [noise]\nI I don't and he said it's darker it's darker periods and that and this is a liberal Democrat but one of the only honest ones you want to be only liberals with courage liberals are not leftist but they are but they are very weak\n... except the case of the rare case of an Alan Dershowitz who has told me personally and on film to me you will see it in my movie without him curled up no safe spaces next year\nAnd said to me that he is far more afraid of the left than of the right\n\nThey well listen to it and see it was all it took her call she was like\nThis is the this is sexual McCarthyism right I mean think of it ladies and gentleman\nI Wonder if somebody had said he committed murder in high school\nWhether they would have been a hearing I doubt it you have any corroboration you have a dead body you have witnesses\nNo and no on all counts I'm Sorry murder is the worst thing that a person can engage in nevertheless we can't stop the engines of government of the United states of America because one person makes warm I'm corroborated charges murder\nTell me where by analogy is by analogy improper\nCoal may tell tell me you are listening tell me why this happened\nOn what grounds were the hearings held say this is what I this is what I said from the beginning I was attacked by conservatives in the Washington Post National Review and elsewhere and I maintain my original position was correct\nAll these conservatives do\nUh is feed the beast yes look at what you can do to ruin a man's reputation man who hundreds of women\nOf all backgrounds in of all political\nPersuasion Z have affirmed subject decent man\nI I'm not sure that I have witnessed something like this in my lifetime and we've had this before with Clarence Thomas or Clarence Thomas ... who is still used as a poster boy for sexual harassment\nAt worst he is accused of talking a mentioning sexual matters in a conversation a with a a was a would be ...\n\nI I happen for the record I happen to think that it's unwise to do I have not done that and I'm not a proponent of it I but I think it needs to be put in perspective\nI mean this is is it the statement of a woman cannot even here talk about sexual matters\nIt is so it is so devastating\nIt is I don't think is a is a affirmative a female strength I don't defend it but I I'm Talking about how how awful is it in the perspective of the awful most of the people are capable of\nProblem is in the United states of America things are so good for so many people in fact a ... an exaggerated view\nOf sin takes place I don't mean religious and secular so\nWhat we are this is what we have witnessed though the closing down of the machine machinery of government they weren't willing to go to California\nThe entire Senate Judiciary committee are you aware of that that was their argument will come to you when she said she was afraid of flying they made an offer of going to her\n... they would go to our representatives of the committee or not the whole could really aren't super important or some accuracy on this program but the one who how what ever the number they were willing to go to her\nAnd it is because we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism just as Alan Dershowitz put\nThe issue\nBut I don't think in real McCarthyism in the actual you were in the Nineteen fifties I don't I don't know I simply don't know if ... if one person had said about a Supreme Court nominee I Know he's he's pro communist\nThat shift ... because he is a is charged with unfairly characterizing decent people's communist just like we have on fair charging of of people a sexual predators\nYou know how many left wing sites called him a serial rapists\nDo magic can be I mean the the men the men must wake up and say God how did this happen\n\nRenee Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three or triple seven six\n\nWhat if this is my question to you and you should posed this too if if if I have talked Kevin or relatives or even willing to talk the remember they are ...\nPeople on the left thinks that they are morally superior and therefore normally rains don't apply like the rules of truth the rules of evidence I Believe women is a statement the truce doesn't matter\nAnd now it's headed to the Senate and that will make the tax cuts permanent or small business and individual because right now they are set to expire and twenty twenty five and we need to get predictability to our small business owner so they can continue doing what they're doing and investing in the economy\nNow folks you can help okay this is a big deal all you need to do than of asking for money they just want you to go to tax cuts work dot com that's touch

the reality is that is um in November that there's going to be a big choice\nAmerican they're going to choose between the continued pro growth job a policy that the administration or they can choose

Arabs are sure which now he was on with Tucker Carlson last night on Fox News and I I really salute them in for his courage very very rare as you know courage is the rarest of the good traits\nWell can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by a liberal president who had been accused Norwood acted similarly I don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker while I can know is just dead wrong this is all about partisanship is the opposite\nWas happening and if it was the Democrats are opening up Kennedy everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is partisanship\nAnd I think the farmers have our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like\nI agree and I hope that the honesty to say so I mean we defended Al Franken on the show I I don't like personally and I hate his politics but I think he got shot to the same reason to yes he defended you wrote a or you want me\n... said that using jazz hands instead of traditional clapping would also optimally be a part of inclusion training\n\nNational union of students women's campaign announced the band at their twenty Fifteen conference after some people complained that the clapping noise was triggering them\nOne Twitter user roast at in us women ... students swim when cam please can we ask people to stop clapping\nBut do feminist jazz hands it's triggering some people's anxiety thank you\nThat's right\nI hear you realize I Wonder if they will start seeing about talk radio it triggers anxiety we should you sign language on\nThe radio show yeah no no of course you got to do away with the applause sound effect none of them are just ...\nThis is the problem this is the problem is I ... I've been saying since I began broadcasting thirty five years ago\nWhen you have massive a massively successful society successful meaning freedom and affluence and people have no\n\nFrom basis no ... and certainly no transcendent basis for their values they make up things and they destroy their own society\nThat is the left the ... of the left magic that\nClapping causes anxiety if clapping causes anxiety what you do is you tell the\nPerson the person who becomes anxious you have to work on it I Know someone who had such anxieties not was clapping but with large groups of people you don't stop large groups of people from meeting you teach the person how to do it\nNo you're allowed to shout down Republicans in restaurants that it it is it your the here's the point you're supposed to do ... anxiety in Republican\nSo it's not a total ban on anxiety producing here is the beginning of the interview with Alan Dershowitz on Fox News with Tucker Carlson\nWho says NATO parties and all the moral moment in our country fall admittedly [noise]\nWhether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial the false and Italy [noise] oh no question the rain [noise] and we should not move on to another candidate\nThat was senator Spartacus in New Jersey and saying as we just heard it doesn't really matter if Brett Kavanaugh is innocent or if he's guilty\nTo my eyes I spent so long attacking him without tangible evidence that really it's his obligation to submit and let his career in application and family be destroyed you know for the good of the country it's a mall question how their shirts as a retired professor the author of the best selling the case against impeaching Trump\nIs a reality check on first principles influence us tonight and dancing professor that that's a fine stand it doesn't matter whether it's in a certain guilty he shouldn't just\nSo bad so it sounds very familiar when I was in college that's what they said about people who are accused of being communist yes as a matter of the yard and the guilty if somebody is accused of being a communist\nAnd you angrily responded and said you're not then hey you don't have the temperament to have the job\nAnd it's just a job interview if you're getting fired for being a professor after forty years and what's the difference if you're innocent or guilty somebody and said you're a communist this was all the way back to the inquisition\nWhen they would call you in first and make you testify and then they present the evidence look once you're accused the most heinous crime imaginable\nIt turns into a trial when you have due process here where the burden of proof is on the other side where the evidence has to be clear and convincing in America we don't allow people to destroy other people's reputations in careers based on an influence of guilt the way the ACLU now says he says we should presumed guilt\nNot presume minutes after a hundred years defending due process it's exactly what they're saying so you are liberal you who have lived her life in a liberal world you're going to Martha's Vineyard liberals to them ever say look I don't agree with Kavanaugh hate tromp\nBut I agree with you that due process is worth preserving other little to feel that way I found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors a signed a letter and asked me to sign it I refused I wrote a dissent

I really am touched thank you for that I Want to talk of people's lives are so much bad stuff that permeates our society Kevin in Columbus ohio Hi\n[noise] hello Dennis our year will fire\nHappy make the world better to have me make\nThe world worse it is a moral obligation to act happy whenever possible guess happiness\nIs a moral virtue and not an emotional state\nThat is something nobody thinks about unless they listen to the ... is our with me\nAnd I was not bragging or any nonsense like that I have zero interest in bragging ... [laughter]\nI just have injuries and telling you the sad truth ... you're not going to be here that outside of this show or my book on happiness that happiness is a moral virtue\nYou know who knew what the founders knew what life liberty and the pursuit of happiness pursuit of happiness is a good thing pursuit of fun is not a good thing\nGet it how we are born here\nToday's topic on a one to ten scale of importance is drum roll play is [noise]\nPoint for four or six new line for three to five\nThat is how important it is my friends we are very precise on this program now you're some the to a gentleman that I work with living martyr and a triple\nG are thinking why does that bring come up with stuff like that is that correct yes all very good yeah you know what that dates you you're very young how do you know that there were slide rules or your father had a slide rule\nI Am living martyr how many are guys under or girls under thirty\nNowhere to slide rule is close to ... that's so interesting how about what else well what was\nThat thing we use where you had the pin on one side and the and the pencil on the other and made a circle\n[noise] what was it ... pro tractor although I have not use that word\nSince before Reagan I Know I pro tractor I Would if you just said you will not eat until you come up with that word I starve to death pro tractor [laughter] do they use that\nYou don't like I was with a bunch of kids the other day kids you know college kids and I asked them how many of you can read and write cursive\n... remember though this was a Colorado Christian university so I think that I got a disproportionately high number who said yeah I could read curses them I said okay how do you write a capital by\n[laughter]\nAnd I can get a very positive response today's subject is indeed extremely important and this was could change your life I'm like I'm not kidding\n[noise]\nVery very very very few people have a good in every area of life\n\nI ... I mean every important area of life let me give you a list right a list of\nAnd if I miss them eight I Would ask the two gentlemen with who I work to come up with something I missed All right now and by the way this is not an order of important it solely an order of their appearance in my brain\nActually my in my mind so for example health\nChildren parents\nSpouse in other words marriage work\n\nAll right how many people can say that in all of those areas of life they have been the recipient of great happiness\nAnswer is very few\nI was with somebody who has a spectacular life spectacular children in great health\n\nAnd a fair marriage a fair marriage ... mother particularly good marriage and this person can even say male or female this person or did I say great career as well that I mentioned that I don't think so children career health\nTerrific marriage fair\nAnd the answer is with the person like a better marriage absolutely is the person basically happy you absolutely\nBecause you have to find happiness where you can that's the lesson of today's happy the shower and very few people find it in all major Remus\n\nAll right that's that's your you don't like your job okay you have a good marriage All right so be happy\n\nTo be the ability to have\nHappiness supplied as it were by every major avenue\nIs a rare warm for most people only Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six is the number if you'd take this seriously you can have a happier life\nIt just it just doesn't work out for everybody to have every major area a happiness producer\nSo your task if you want to be happy as opposed to unhappy and I I this is one of the revelations of my life is how many people really don't work on being happy\nAm I to me that's more amazing that people not working on their health but maybe it's maybe it's that Maliki is\nYou know if people do X Y or Z they would be healthier and they don't do it\nBecause I guess it's hard but maybe it's hard to be to work on being happy so\nIt is what it is but if you want to be happy or happy or you have to understand you have to accept the fact that very few people for very few people those life deliver him all arenas\nOf life that's that's key\nBecause otherwise what you do is you fixate on that which isn't good so this person was a a fair marriage that you know nothing to write home about him no not worthy of divorce\nUnderstands that there are other avenues oh excuse me I Can't believe it I Can't believe I missed one\nI should send myself the punishment room but I've never I've never done that I've the punishment room is only earned for carelessness not for content but I don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe content should should apply anyway friends\nHow did I forget that one\nSo friends hell marriage I said parents I ah\nKnow of course children I Know but I I'm thinking I don't include parents in the look if you have wonderful parents it's a big bonus in life is all put parents and\nSo parents children friend's health work marriage there you go if you got 'em on all cylinders that I mean that's like having an all wheel drive\nAnd be and I was thinking of a brand name but I don't want to push of any particular brand name here but you know what I mean I mean in all wheel drive super luxury s._u._v.\n\nAlright that's it's not most people can't afford it or just don't have one a Prager seven seven six\nOf like you to call it an obviously you have a question or um UC few differ you know if you don't have one of those well the truth is if you don't have health that's a toughie I Would say of all of them that may be my might be the toughest but it depends what health means\nIf you if the health is debilitating or not for example Charles crowd hammer the wonderful late commentator you know it was paralyzed almost fully from the neck down that's bad health but he he he was a fully functioning\nHighly functioning more functioning that most people who aren't power walk [noise]\nIndividual who love life [noise] alright\nEvery body you gotta find happiness where you can and few people have it in all the arenas of life that I mentioned\n[noise] you are listening to the happiness our second hour every Friday on the dentist\nPrager show that Dennis Prager show live from the relief factor pain free entity oh\nSo that makes sense that really it's a very good answer I think it [laughter]\nOh You're welcome thank you that's the best question answer good\nEr I liked that\nOne if you do this is from triple ... what if you do with the other person in your life fails to realize this\nTime you'll be happy with someone who doesn't realize that she told me about a a a a love interest I you're talking about a friend ...\nWell I Would answer it let's say even a spouse let's say you have a spouse that isn't on board and in these matters twice said then you still have the\nHopefully health friend's children parents or work and remember or not in order to be sources of happiness this is so I wasn't I was kidding about nine point nine four seven six for three to four seven three six to but I'm not kidding about how important this is\nAnd you can't that's why Julie's question was so important you can't pay this is how people live I'm not happy but I Will be happy when I get a raise\nWhen I have a better job when I Move to a to Baltimore oh well as a bad choice oh I'm kidding Baltimore I'm kidding I'm totally kidding don't be offended when I get married when I have children when my children got to get married when I leave\nOur eyes that's good when I lose this weight that's right yes there's always a wedding I'll be happy when you can't do I'll be happy when\n[laughter]\nThat that's the boys did all this time until when that happens is wasted\n\nAnd you don't know how much time you'll get anyway you know people die young\nJust for the record you don't you don't we don't have any guarantees you celebrate what you can now\nYes it's very important\nThe when issue ... people have that that I have talked about but not as the women issue and I like that as the wet issue I really could do another happiness book [noise]\n\n\nI sit here and I do believe this is helping people that that gives me a ...
