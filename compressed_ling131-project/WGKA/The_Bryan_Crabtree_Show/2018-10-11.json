no no no other\nSo that's the reason I worry about that that China has abused the world Trade Organization that it is abused intellectual property\nIf I I personally a worry more about China than about Russia\nFor a whole host of reasons I and I think the Chinese nationalism is growing at ... China I Know a fair amount about China because of my involvement with Chinese people\nAnd a ... ... people don't know how corrupt China's that corruption is a way of life in China\nFrom inside I Know for example people often pay for pay for judges they normally pay the judge they pay to get the judge and then get the verdict that they want\nIt's uh it it it it's\nA truly in many ways I mean not all Chinese Chinese come to the United states for example they become spectacularly successful\nBy a surgeon is one is what such example who is considered somewhat of genius\nAnd by by recent or

persecution of Christians in China has increased all of this is to tell you\nThat it is totally understandable that at some point someone some president interested in America is going to have to confront China better sooner than later however I worry because of North Korea\nThat's that's the issue\nNorth Korea can or cannot defend the resolve of Kim Jong than to do nothing with regard to

prophetic words they shake the demons tremble when you speak truth to power and when ... when this president says something like\nA cabinet you are an innocent man in front of the world in front of the whole world\nPeople lose their minds because you have just spoken a powerful truth that everyone says you must not take sides you must not\nAnd so he is the focus I mean most people who like him understand this but I think a lot of people on the fence trying to think of him out and I really thought first of all with all this hour notice in our time the bitter sour left you know\nA ... banging on the Supreme Court door and shrieking or like dabbles and and behaving like children this madness first of all\nWe need to have some humor and to celebrate what is good ... remember of course the

Saturday that isn't that a lot of truth in those burn out that's exactly right so so we created a fables called Donald drained the swamp it's about a caveman name Donald okay all the cave people are angry because they say\nThe king king lives in the middle of a swamp\nAnd he never he's totally out of touch with us he doesn't know about our concerns we can't even talk to him because the swamp people uh protect him he will only talk to people who live in the swamp what do we do so they go to Donald Donald is a kind of a famous caveman he's a builder of caves everybody wants to have built by Donald\nUh and so they go to Donald Donald can you help us\nAre they telling us that the situation is is what tomorrow you know I've got some time I'll go down to the swamp and see what's going on so we take a walk down to the swamp encounters a first swamp creature\nA lobbyist tourists and the lobbyists or says ... you don't understand you can't talk to the king the king doesn't talk to people who live outside the swamp he only live inside some so if you want to live in a smart maybe we can work something out dumped has not interested I'll see you later so he goes back and tells\nThe cave people he says listen it's worse than we thought were gonna have to get drastic and he said they said what do you mean drastic he says we are going to have to drain the swamp and they kind of get scared like you can't say that don't that don't say that the\nHe says I don't know if the only way and if you will how you gonna do you're gonna get a swamp people angry and he goes well you're angry aren't you and they say yes and it's just well maybe it's their turn\nSo the next day he decides I'm going to dig a trench he's a builder he knows how to do this all this tug of war and Mexico is not going to pay for it but he says we're going to build the biggest [noise]\nThe ... trench we've ever dug and so he goes by himself with a shovel down to the swamp now the swamp creatures come out one of them looks\nA little bit like Chuck Schumer one of them might look like Hillary Clinton I'm not being specific about that often do you yeah the artist did it it's like you when you look at it you can figure out who these people are but but they get angry they said we live here you're sticking\nAnd and he says well we'll give you a live where we live you either live or where we live and they say we don't want to live outside the swamp the people that play the swamp are uneducated they're on cultured they're deplorable\nAnd he understands that you know what all he needs to do is dig the trench and ignore these creatures so he starts the trench and as he is taking the trench he sees that the swamp green color the swamp is actually the color of money why\nBecause the whole swamp is money that's why the swamp creatures will not leave the swamp so he starts digging and then the biggest battle swamp creature ball shows up and he's angry the biggest bad a swamp creature of all is called the George Soros\nAnd the Georgia sources really angry has bags under his other than the he looks Hungarian\nAnd he looks like a billionaire but but the Georgia ... is really angry but Donald turns around and all of the cave people are showing up with shovels and they say well not as angry as we are and they help him dig the trench dig the trench during the swamp drained his while the rest of it away okay but want to have to buy it for the incredible credible but but at the end of the book\nThere is a true teaching moment about what is self government what does it mean for people to govern themselves with American style self government Donald rises to the occasion and he refuses to be the new king he says no no no a free people govern themselves\nAnd that is very exciting so they so he says if you look at for president not a King I'm your caveman\nWashington gentleman ladies listeners think about the facts the greatest works of fiction or about reality about truth Shakespeare
