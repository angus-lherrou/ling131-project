I may be [laughter] space from it [laughter] anyway\nMost Tucker Carlson of course of a Fox News\nThe uh the Tucker Carlson Tonight Show or a ... I didn't even know how to name it ... it was just talk her curls anyway he has a book out because he he used thoughtful that's the reason that I'm I'm having your mom with regard to visit me a lot of people in television gripe boats God Bless them\nBut the Tucker Carlson is worth reading a book a shipper fools or there's a great a great title how selfish ruling class you bringing America to the brink of revolution so let's talk about your book the book of folks use up at the dentist Prager dot com so\nWhy does it mean a ruling class who who is in that class\nWell the people that I grew up with um started just can be totally clear I'm not much of a populist and I'm certainly not a representative who coal country I mean I grew up in the ... in Georgetown so it's basically people who have thrive under our current economic system if you want to know with\n... you know if you look around and you and the people you know are richer than they were before the financial crisis of two thousand eight you know you're probably in that group and it's not a slower it's just you know every society is higher higher article because people are higher mean dogs or hierarchical animals are\nSo you're always going to have a relatively small number of people who make a disproportionate number of to take\nThe question is not are you going to have a ruling class the question is are they upped the task of ruling in my argument is that the people currently in charge or not and that's why we got Trump\nOkay so so this vessel is a very heavy stuff there let me let me dissect this for a second ruling class for you is an economic criterion not a political or push these criteria\nWell it is both is both the ... if you look around the country to three hundred and thirty five million there almost an infinite number of decisions he made about how those people live\nWhat they can say what they do for a living in a relatively small number of people make a disproportionate number of those decisions so the economic decisions are made just proportionally in New York on Wall street in Washington by the Federal Reserve the political decisions are made almost exclusively in Washington is ... about what your kids watching TV or see on the Internet\nOr made almost exclusively in California and New York and Los Angeles and so you know the west side of LA has a lot more influence over the country than the west side of we do I mean that and by the way I don't I'm not saying that's bad I'm\nJust saying if you have more influence over how other people live you ought to consider yourself a steward of the country and you ought to make wise decisions not just decision to benefit you in our leadership have and that's\nOkay what what in your mind was there a time when the elite were steering the ship in a good direction\nWell I mean is it you know in a democracy you need to start with her for personal sort of democracy must have it's correct was it for a functioning democracy that you have\nAn independent self supporting growing middle class you have to have a middle class democracy only works the middle class countries that doesn't work and said Venezuela where you have this dramatic wealth divide because if you give every person look vote\nBut not an economic franchise they punish you by electing people like Hugo Chavez her Nichols but there are so you need it you need a middle class\nYou can judge the advocacy and the wisdom of the ruling class by how well the middle class people beneath them arguing\nAnd our middle class is shrinking in absolute terms or life expectancy is in decline and so that's like the most simple measure there is that's all you need to know that our middle class is no longer majority as two thousand Fifteen and the people in charge ought to be worried about that they're not\nAll right so there were or are they identical issues and the decline of the middle class and ethnic and told me this is a fair summary of your view a corrupted elite\nWell I I I think it's probably slightly more complicated and I think there are factors that I don't understand very precisely I mean\nNothing is the results at one cause of course that's always an oversimplification is always the problem with your writing about the stuff so I mean I'm sure there's a lot going on our economy has changed in weight because of automation on the rise of finance or the product of no one person's decision I mean this is not a conspiracy I Would say\nBut it's a it's it's a confluence of a bunch of different factors that have\nConverged to hurt the middle class\nTo devalue labor so that the labor of the individuals were much less than it was in Nineteen Seventy because of automation and technology and all of\nThat has made the average person less powerful less at one and less likely to believe that his kids will do better than you will have which is of course the American dream\nAll of that makes her society more volatile and are ruling class job it is to think about stuff like this and to steer the ship in the right direction has ignored all of it has refused to take responsibility for their decisions refused to admit they're even a ruling class or even in charge\nAnd and and that's why we're seeing about ... I mean one big changes which is so striking to me as someone who's interested in the aggressive movement\nAnd Teddy Roosevelt in in the Arab the robber Baron what the Carnegie Rockefeller Phipps and you know the people who we think of as you know the fat cats\nOf Nineteen Fifteen they understood themselves to be the ruling class they knew they were the richest most privileged people in this society and they understood that came with responsibilities as well as benefit our current ruling class Jeff Bezos than Mark Zuckerberg and the Twitter guys and\nThe you know Travis overt Hooper I mean these are kids who have a billion dollars or several but they drifting T shirts and act as if they're just like you and me they were used to shoulder the responsibilities that come with the power they wield and that's part of the problem\nWhy would they do differently if they were responsible\nFor the first thing you would do if you're an employer\nIf you're running a large corporation is think about the welfare of your own employees\nSo it's always a tell them this is universal on the left when people start talking about abstract\nIdeas rather than concrete solutions in other words if I run Hooper for example I've got one of the largest workforces in the world I think the second largest workforce in the world so before I started lecturing you about climate change or black lives matter\nI with the first thing I Would do is make certain that every one of my employees was treated as well as I could possibly train them I Would I don't know give them health insurance or pay a minimum wage I Would do those things because they're my employees and like my own children I'm responsible for them to some extent I Believe that\nIn earlier generations of leaders believe that they were motivated by in part the guilt they they'll hold their religious convictions they felt they had a duty to other people are currently leaders for example it Hoover don't even claimed them as employees were drivers don't have health insurance they're not super employees they're contractors they're part of the gig economy\nAnd so we're letting the most powerful off the hook\nFor their obligations to their fellow man and at the same time we're allowing them to lecture the rest of us as if there are moral superiors it's a very odd arrangements so Travis from looper is totally confident he was a much better person than you even as one third of Hoover drivers will lose money driving for Uber so how does that work exactly I'm baffled\nI'm speaking with Tucker Carlson of Fox News his book just out just to ship a fool's the subtitle is how selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution [noise]\nThis is not an all the criticism is only an observation and I'm like you to react to your critique is a critique that would would resonate one hundred percent with folks on the left is that fair to say\nNot anymore my critique is one that would have been common among liberals in Nineteen Seventy five when liberals worried about are set they worry about things like concentration of power and free speech and due process\nAnd that these were the liberal obsessions of my childhood because they instinctively sided with the powerless against powerful\nForty years later liberals wheel the power every one of our institutions our biggest institutions academic business political they're all run by cultural liberals all of them and so now the left has power and they identify with the powerful\nThat showed me All right hold on the talk are we going to take a break I Do you all about that across to the Fox news the book is up and Dennis ... ship a fool's is the fourth Forman concise book and we will continue when we return on the Venice\nAnd it's not that they're not smart or they didn't try hard or they didn't have the best intentions they did it the best intentions but they were focused on the wrong thing once he should care about is the way people live the family is the very center it's the Adam in matters the court building block of everything and when that collapses there's no hope\nOf doing anything positive so and they ignored that and I think they know that now\nWhere I ... I feel for me asking you this but I it's it's truly meant out of curiosity 'cause I saw respect you where do you stand on President Trump\nI think that\nUm well I mean just as an overview I agree with you know the the majority the strongest overwhelming majority of what Trump says\nUm I think Tom's genius I think you need to understand from credits at Trump's genius is not in affecting policy change I don't think he\nHas control over the executive branch his portion of government I don't think he understands how it works I don't think he's going to learn I don't think he's good at getting his program through Congress I don't think Congress wants to get his program into law\nSo on that level Trump is a frustrating president to watch I think that Trump's value ingenious is in raising the question that no one else was willing to raise even think about as a kind of clarity very simple clarity so he will say things like well wait a second you know we had\nNATO which was this great force for forty years but it existed in order to keep the Soviets were invading Western Europe Soviet the longer this so why do we still have NATO\nWell I don't know what the answer is that's a totally fair question and one that we all should have been asking the Nineteen Ninety One when the Soviet Union collapsed or why we thought Afghanistan seven teen years later or why are we allowing the south Koreans cheat in this trade deal or why don't we build the wall it what's the answer speak slowly so I can understand\nThat is genius being brave enough and clear enough to raise the core questions that we ought to be debating long after Trump's gone those questions will hang in the air and my hope that someone will answer them and solve those problems but first you need to you need to define what the problems are and I think the Trump has been really good at that\nAll right a final question because I Know I Know your time is limited so you have on guests who I find ah intellectually morally intolerable which is which is fine [laughter]\n\nOkay so I just want to know what you see their name as listed on your program notes this is who will have um do you think oh my God I Can't believe this or I dread this or you know what this is what I Do for a living and what the hell\nWhy put their names on that list so I'm I'm responsible for that and I just like literally minutes

effective marital therapy relationship therapy our and the reasons\nAre I'm pretty honest about tough subjects and I'm not a man fan or a woman than there were a beautiful man and beautiful women men disgusting women and disgusting Batman that's just the way it is I think it's pretty even actually [laughter] okay [laughter]\nI think it just works out that way it's pretty even so this is pretty honest talk sometimes\nThe ... the subjects are less intense than others but very revealing today is a less intense but very revealing subject\nAre you ready here it goes beep your honeymoon correctly predict your marriage\nWon eight ... seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six did you have a great honeymoon and you ended up with we've understandable ups and downs great marriage\nDid you have a lousy honeymoon and\nTurned out to be indeed a lousy marriage or a lousy honeymoon and the great marriage or a great honeymoon lousy marriage\nHow accurate is the honeymoon\nPredicting what happens in a marriage I always ask\nMy model is no such thing as old but I I usually ask couples or individual actually use not usually a couple of cars they're divorced I I often ask individuals were divorced\nWhen do do you know it was bad it was a bad marriage and it is amazing how often I and I hear that if the well then is to sell you the truth or the honeymoon\nI I Am quite close and it's not my my wife but I'm quite close to a woman who that is exactly what happened in her case\nHe was a very romantic Souter of her they got married fairly quickly and on the honeymoon a lot of his awful traits actually appeared and she wondered\nWell I guess I'm a male putting words into her mind I I don't know if she did but I assume she wandered who did I marry and it does this portend\nAccurately or am I Am about to experience in the marriage and incidentally if the honeymoon if on the basis of your responses I don't find a particular\nRelationship between the quality of the honeymoon and Michael in any direction it might be a lousy hunting when the great marriage remember a I'm offering that is just as distinct the possibilities the other way around I have a larger question\nThat is worth it I think exploring how important is a honeymoon I I can see a very good argument for right after the marriage\nJumping into a normal life I can also see a great argument for getting away from every body of just having time for the two I I I'm not an advocate here about having a honeymoon I'm not an advocate for having one\nI think that there are good arguments for for both\nUh or delaying you know for six months or something as some people do 'cause they just can't get away at that time but I I don't know the answer I don't know if the honeymoon has been\nA a generally positive force in bonding people or irrelevant or even counterproductive I don't I don't have an answer to that\nIt would be an interesting study to engage in however but that's not really the question it's it may be the upshot of the hour but it's not the question of the hour the question of the hour is how much\nOr is was your honeymoon as if to the rest of your marriage was it a good predictor all righty\n\nLet's go to our best in Philadelphia Hi Beth thank you for calling\nTo talk to you good um\nMy husband and I had an oval in Bermuda\nAnd um [noise] actually affect the earlier that this summer for the first time after I celebrate ... years and the second time around it was like shocked as amazing as the first time\nUm but that one one funny thing from our I thought oh I never I\nDidn't either um prior to our honeymoon we definitely to each other you know little little habits\nLike for example um you know I I really like my place in like ... and and you know he'd be waiting and waiting for the other way so that we can start our days activities\nUm but that you know the hunting for them they read a wave of everyday life had to learn a little bit about each other um you know in in ... in ways that we hadn't gotten\nSo you know I I Am for from what you said you were not living together prior to marriage\nFor religious reasons yeah\nSo that you you have just given me another topic for a male female our because I Wonder if the honeymoon is not more exciting if you didn't live together\nAnyway I mean how could not be [laughter]\nI mean that was definitely a a big anticipation for the wedding night for sure [laughter]\nI like you are is your husband is happy you are\nA is an incredible man that I Know\nWow you are
