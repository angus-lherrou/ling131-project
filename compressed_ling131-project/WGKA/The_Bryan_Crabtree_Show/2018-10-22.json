R. Hawkins and I've been communicating during the break at the top of this hour he let's just say kids sports an X rays okay something needs to be taken care of\nThat are more important than the program right now and we've just totally W.

is critical for the survival of our country sort\nYou better believe it is but let me since you mentioned that but let me get your opinion on this because you you you've been around you know these things and I know you feel this I I don't have to sit in and look at you I Know this through osmosis of white minds I knew I Know how your thinking here because I Know what you're talking about it I I

going to tell you right now and I'm sticking to my guns house is going to pick up four or five Republican seats set it's going to pick up three to four Republican seat and that whole blue way you're going to have the same boat lick and that was going on after ... after Hillary Clinton or let me remind you\nTen days before the election the New York times and twenty sixteen hundred Ninety two percent chance to eight percent chance that she was going to be elected so don't pay attention to this garbage that you're seeing in the polls is just the media telling you what they want that's just may not where I Want to get your opinion of\nThose people who hate us those socialist who are now openly running as social to destroy this country and tear down its culture that we've grown up with them that I Want to give to my children who hate Donald Trump and what he stands for because God Forbid somebody disagree with\nThem and their ideology they're going to go nuts after the midterms because guess what's going to happen after the midterms Donald Trump is still going to be president\nAnd those next two years I think John you're going to be very very scary in America are you feeling that same steps of buddies\nWell law a sure what will you put that in the ...\nIt ... from from the other side and literally that's what they have\nBecause there was nothing rational about the the ... you know what we have a perfect record of communism socialism destroying countries every\nEvery time it's ever been tried other ... percent ... percent destroys the economy destroys the futures of all you do a lot of blizzards of\nPeople hundred percent you know the communist China has adopted capitalistic qualities and look how success what\nTrump has not been able to take the chains all these just loosened them and look at the progress we've made here in this country just after you've been in and he has a lot to say he's only lose for enterprise was such an incredible system and and these people it you know I don't it was still alive\nLong enough loud enough a big enough black people will believe I'm fortunate\nUnfortunately we have a thanks to the educational system especially being so uh so cause them in so many areas in our country\nLook where we have a snowflake generation I Can't even buy their own those and these people are threatened enough to put the little rascals that got you know they don't take ... and that's both to scare us you know it's what the guns it's us with the comments there will only we tell you what\nBarry import more what you said ... we'll only lose\nIf we ... ourselves blues\nMan you don't do that from your you\nKnow let me stop you there I I got to stop you right there for just a second I'll let you continue because David coterie of very good friend of mine prolific writer and think or he's just he's just a great intellect David ...\nDavid reminded us on this program a number of weeks ago Johnny ... would you just said it was what

have a Second Amendment right to own and keep and bear arms in America there can be no confiscation in America we can only willfully hand them over\nA year that\nThat we were you just said that's what you just set so we in that same sense what they're trying to do is\nEnd run around the constitution Johnny is you know in the courts to do it using ballot measures like they're doing in Washington state her down and talking about it I sixteen thirty nine and others and Arizona is about an issue can stay where you sit very volatile right now we discussed it last week in Arizona\nBoth on the

rolling Johnny about one more segment laugh I'm gonna region email that's okay this is an interesting email\nLet me start this up who set this up where you\nWhile I was in Arizona I was talking when I was at the ... this broadcast the monster broadcast Sunday broadcast last week in Arizona at the Sheraton\nI was talking about how Arizona is widely regarded as the most unfriendly said the country and it is and that's because of the methods that you don't need a permit you go to carry law binding citizen to go to Arizona carrier got simple as that carry your don't take it with you to Arizona feel free however\nBut I made the comment I see more no guns allowed signs in Arizona on one trip that I see in Thirteen Years of living in Georgia\nOkay there's a reason now here's here's an email Matthew Murphy writes that mark tombstone is now Second Amendment city on yesterday's daily defense you mentioned that there were all kinds of signs around to some saying no guns allowed how can I claim to be a Second Amendment city when all the establishment say no guns allowed now let me give you my answer they don't want to turn it over you\nMatthew that's a great question I've heard it before here's why it's Arizona State law it comes from alcohol serving establishment predominantly I don't think I've ever seen a no gun side at a\nOf a stepson or gift shop if you will it only seems to be in\nRestaurants that serve alcohol now both sides in Arizona do carry the weight of law what I mean by that is if you walk into that establishment in violation of it sit at the bar and have a beer or you can be charged with criminal trespass\nImmediately and the signage in Arizona doesn't have to meet a certain standard some owners of those establishment for whatever reason\nAs their owners have decided they don't want you when you can walk away now I have spoken and I won't name two of the popular bars in in Tucson I won't need them by name doesn't matter Johnny [noise] but I've spoken to the owners of them on both occasions and both times I got the same response we would prefer you didn't\nBut if you want to uh let us know and we'll check it for you that one Arizona law for ... if if if a business tells you and has a sign that says no guns allowed they by law in Arizona have to provide you\nA state storage for that firearm while you were there most businesses believe it or not are not in compliance of that but that's why that is that the alcohol serving establishing Johnny you want to take that email from their\n... and you're right Omar pretty much and realized that uh you know we have people from all over the country over the world comes to stall and as some of these folks are or not familiar with guns\nAnd they they want to make a statement and it also you've got somebody will now there are just on the Gulf trouble so so\nWhat that is an insurance policy against someone told me a drink too much and having a fire or maybe not knowing how to handle it again to a visitor someone that might not be familiar with was just how this goes\nAnd and you know post and the the law is that if you you can go if there's not a sign there you can take your gun on a ball places ... your ... your but but you can't drink you've got to say a ... if you got you know drink\nAnd so that's that's how that works\nAnd I got assigned limited not be there to cause I got to throw this disclaimer into Johnny and that is Arizona is a constitutional carry permit let's carry state you do not need a permit in hand to carry a firearm in Arizona however in order to carry into an establishment that serves alcohol\nYou must have a permit constitutional Kerry is brilliant permit was Kerry is prohibited sea so Matthew I what I'm telling you hear is it's the it's really state law that's in play here and not every bar and restaurant has that side\nBut there are a lot to do and and when you're in an area like Scottsdale like on that which is lots of bars and great restaurants you tend to see more of them in Arizona because state law allows for that\nAnd it does carry the weight of law you still have anti people out there even though it's a gun friendly state so I Hope I answered your question Johnny did you want to put a ... that's when they went on it\nI think you did really well and you're right and uh personally uh I just prefer not to freak all the places they'll go well maybe by ... on it how are you still there are simple but I'll go to where I can because again\nThe the bad people ... to ... it was not his only goal of a sudden you know a a isn't it amazing how we see countries that\nThat the war to disarm the suicide in the middle of the people go out there with their little signs that say oh well my freedom mail but you know a size don't work very well just bullets or miles of water real food that amazing\nYeah they also don't work out they don't work well against no food or drink and studio either hold on one second [laughter] [laughter] I was getting a little bit thirsty there are so yeah there you go about ice cold water and you know a lot of these expensive equipment in here Johnny as you well know now there is no\nThere is a W. R. wrote this up on the twenty first which is today and I wanted to get your opinion on this with the last minute that we have\nGun control group urging people to Texas authorities and report armed citizen and the name of the group is guns down America\nLet's see where they're at USA Today quoted guns down America director ... ... say given the troubling political rhetoric we've seen over the

fear of intimidation well you know I just read that for the first time here's what it ought to say\nGiven the troubling political rhetoric from the left that we've seen over the last two years and that done are far too scary for those on the left this campaign will help the majority of ... who don't trust Americans feel a little better my response to that is go to\nWhat's your response to that one\nWell I'll tell you what are we we have a special program Ben is coal adopted go ... if you have a gun out there they're struggling you at home and and you feel like it's a problem because we have families waiting to accept your job is certainly\nYou can head over to Johnny rolling dot com and find the context of what is that well hey Johnny I Can't wait to have you back I have thoroughly

and that is married Dusten ask the pool who was sitting with me to their Mr ... it is a pleasure thank you for being here today\nWell it's an honor to have you here in tombstone to and I appreciate the fact that you've been such a a faithful um I guess you'd call in the history buff on tombstone Arizona\nYeah well I'll tell you it's it's been a long it's been a long time I ... a long story short when the first movie to stone came out\nWithout Kilmer in the guys I so I have to go there I knew it was actually I have to go and I did I went out later that year and I've been coming back to the city every year since then I think about Eighteen months without a stretch and I got to tell you pull into town today you have done an unbelievable job here at the place looks great\nThank you thank you will have to you know it takes a lot of a coordinated effort with all of the merchants and the citizens to make the town look as good as it does today and a dinner on them and I like to talk about the citizens are\nIn a which by the way I don't know if you told your listeners but as of today you become a U.S on or a citizen of tombstone Arizona the town to to to die for a long list salad and over here and I was a pleasure for me to be able to make you fellows both of you are\nOn average citizens of tombstone\nWhile what I'm going to do is I'm going to shake your power right now and thank you because I Want to listen to the original radios theater of the mind we've got a couple of plaques here and I I Can't I Can't tell you almost brought tears to my city of Tucson honorary citizen presented to mark well by the ... and in addition to that you handed both Alan Hi\nAt golden keys to the city of Tucson and I got to tell you that\nTo me is what this is one of the coolest things I've ever gotten in my life thank you very much\nWas it was my honor I Will tell you though a market it doesn't work on the job you can't\nGet out of jail [laughter] I have absolutely no intention of finding out I Do know that they were hopeful over the next two days that were here that will be able to talk with the sheriff was quickly because your time is very valuable I Know you have another meeting used quite the history of tombstone you didn't just get here\nNo I'm actually force the generation native of tombstone or my great grand dad came here and Eighteen Seventy seven it was a a reporter for the San Francisco chronicle doing a story about the boomers southwest and captured drowned them all\nAnd ended up the cap what you could move out to Eighteen miles west of here\nAnd they told him about a fellow man I met ... made a big strike here and he ended up over there become friends with him and it wasn't long after that he'd give him a contract to hold timbers into the end of the new newly found mines and we've been here ever since\nYou know I Know I Know a lot of the history of the town so we and I've told my audience over the years the story of ed shuffling and\nHow he was told how the town got its name that he was told by the guards at Fort which you can now that he would find as you know what are you doing going out there in the middle of the night and Apache cut you off what are you looking for he said he was looking for silver and gold he says they told them and you tell me if it's true that all he was you'll find out there is this tombstone and that's how he named his first strike is that true\nThat's absolutely true we actually to a chef and had a he had a unique way of name and his money claims and his first one called students don't need called a tombstone because that's what the soldiers out their temperature could totally all you're going to find out there it is your tombstone\nAnd uh and and believe it or not the next ah\nSiamese decked out what is called the graveyard\nWith what I think it's fascinating to me is that your grandfather your great grandfather nearing them now after that strike he went back to Illinois was she from Illinois and he raised enough money with his brother to come back out and this is when to sell it exploded from that point forward\n[noise] pretty much yes from that point forward or it wasn't long have you had a a prospectors coming from all over and uh all over the country mostly read from Nevada ah northern Nevada northern Arizona tombstone to stake their claims and that's how it started\nAnd now tombstone became in this made national news and I want to talk with you a bit about it now it became the first America's first second amendment city how how did that tell me about that\nWell you know it's it's only appropriate that a tombstone would recognize the second amendment since uh you know we're famous for a lot of things that are mostly for the gun fights a\nAlso were famous because we've always believed in having firearms to protect ourselves along the Mexican border and we're a\nAnd you know and I'm not talking about that about Mexicans are are Indians books we had to watch out for the Indians too so the second amendment was important back in the Eighteen hundreds just as just as it is today by\nOften say use the phrase that the city not not just the city what state of Arizona real America in general but where we sit down particular was built on the gun is that a true statement\nWell ah I I think that would be a true statement yes or\nNo you're getting ready to again because we have just a couple of minutes and do you have another point but but you're getting ready to celebrate Eldorado day here in tombstone that starts next weekend this coming weekend and it kicks off of course eight October twenty six is the virtue of the one\nThat was the gunfight at the OK Corral\nThe big gunfire ... stone famous um\nA wider the was successful in getting tore out about the gun fight when they moved away from Arizona into California and the ... to it's become very famous down worldwide\nNow is that a good thing for the city of Tucson let it snow for the gunfight at the OK Corral\nWell I you know it it's ... it's a lot of folks think the tombstone as the Old West synonymous with with the tombstone\nAh that doesn't mean that tombstone supports treating people down in the streets [laughter] it just means that we know order history is now we know how important it was to have the guns back in the Eighteen hundreds as well it is today\nOr in the you know wider and his brother actually went to his brother perjure was the was the actual Marshall tombstone\nAnd they actually tried to control the guns by making the guy's either carrier gunner or check it in and they weren't allowed to carry guns in town\nAnd a lot of people don't realize that talked about it a show but this was early form of gun control by ... it was not very successful in town was\nNo it wasn't and actually that law is on the books up until the seventies\nThen somebody challenged it and said you can't do that that's against the state statutes in the Constitution's Second Amendment and to the judge overruled an overturned ordinance and did away with it so that you can carry a firearm anywhere in the city of ...\nIt is absolutely and I am carrying right I Hope that's okay right\nI'm going into stone yoga okay good I'm going to things that you know it's fascinating because that the gunfight at the OK Corral of course was actually fought over gun control emerge or from the boys walked right down the street outside where we are now down Fremont Street made a leftover by flash photography studio\nAnd said we're here for your guns one of them went for it in ... said hold that's not what I Want\nThat over gun control some threats by the by the folks who are actually violating the law right\nThat that's absolutely correct and actually it didn't start just that day they'd been warning that\nThe Klan or that you can\nYour guns into stone we've made the lawn you're gonna live by the law than to that that that day was the more than point where it finally\nBlue overdone and the ... you know I Wonder sometimes as many shots as they shot and there was only a couple of guys here and\nNot what's on your real quickly we've only got a couple of minutes or but it was a if I'm not mistaken about thirty four seconds was the total fight summer didn't last thirty five started to rapid fire shots when often succession and to this day we don't know who fired the shots is that right\nThat's correct the there's no record is there is no way to prove which who shot the first show\nWas your grandfather here in her great grandfather here in town at that time\nShe was\nDo you have any writings are stories I mean this is fascinating Alan Gottlieb is sitting across from me and he's he's grinning from ear to ear with each question with these with each after we've been a long time coming trying to get it going to talk to him shortly but does do you have any family or air loser recollections or anything from that\nWell I won't tell you that uh my grandad or\nAnd my great grand uh uh we're pro Clinton climbers they were ranchers is that right really Clinton had eighty seven dollars in his pocket when he was killed over here in that eighty some dollars had been paid by my great grandfather for breaking some more since foreign so\nWow see I I'm just sitting here\nThat is a fascinating story Mr Mayor were coming to the end of the segment I I can sit here with you on
