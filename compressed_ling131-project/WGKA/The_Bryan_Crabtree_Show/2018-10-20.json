avenue near where I used to live downtown [noise]\nAll sort of see how it played out [noise]\nSo obvious but the man was murdered [noise]\nBased on anything anybody can imagine it's indefensible morally indefensible crime was committed against them and\nThere's a lot about the man that I don't know I don't know wash his views were used portrayed as a liberal in Saudi Arabia against an autocratic regime\nBut they're all the reports about him but no matter what his views that this is obviously not something we can morally accept the question that looms larger than that however is why is there's so much attention being paid here\nDissidents or regime opponents in the middle east or routinely murdered ...\n... it's one of the great puzzles of life but I think I have an answer to this one but it is often a puzzle as to why something dominates the news and something else doesn't\nThe Saudi ... the Saudi regime got rid of someone wanted to get rid of\nAnd now in the year twenty Eighteen this is international\nNews to the extent that it is an ongoing daily story\n\nGiven how many people who who oppose Assad tortured to death\nOr\nIn the Egyptian regime or in other North African regimes other Arab countries or the Muslim countries but how many people have been tortured to death in Iran can be remaining won\nSo why why is this so much of a fixation\nThe question is not whether or not we accept what happened and\nThe question is why is there a fixation on this may well one reason as you wrote columns for the Washington Post so he has a connection to the west and specifically to be murdered states all over is that we have\nPhotographic data\nWith regard to I mean the man walks into a consulate and river walks out pretty bad I mean when we have that on video we have on video or other men and dreams\nAnd we have the information about those men and during turkey and then leaving turkey so everything is obvious why the Saudi regime or elements of the Saudi regime would want to get rid of this man that's a puzzle to me\nDid you ever hear of this guy ah I'm I immersed myself in world affairs and I've ever heard of the guy\nAnd by the way if you read the column that not exactly a cent leaving or revealing or or anything I mean it's the Washington Post walk to the show to ride around a lot of understand that for which they had an Iranian writer\nWho was who was a district but the guy would be a dead on arrival deal way so here's my theory is why there are such preoccupation with this ban\nThere are two reasons in my opinion one is Saudi Arabia's available you'll be invited speech and\nThe\nMedia are far more preoccupied with the bad things that our laws do than the bad things that enemies do yeah you might want to ask why the call I don't know for this is this is bill speculation\n\nThey would I think they would argue we we have influence on allies we don't have influence our enemies\nTherefore on those that we can influence which we should try to have some influence\nThat's the most noble read of the preoccupation with the deprivation of allies as opposed to the death for patients of enemies\nBut there's ... there's nothing I'm the dissidents in Iran and women Iran did in fact have an uprising during the ... during the Obama administration machine\nSo they said nothing and the the that that was defended by the entire liberal slash left media because it was Brock Obama\nSo back to the question why is there such preoccupation because one one is\nIf you have a moral sense and it's a very important thing for a lot of people think well up themselves and we we can feel good about ourselves we are bringing to the world's attention\nSomething terrible that an ally of the United states that the second reason is that he's not only an ally of the Saudi regime is not only in LA the United states in ally of the most hated man in the world most hated man in the world for the left is about Kim Jong un\nAnd it is about the Ayatollah Khamenei me\nA news not the end is not Bashar al Assad is Donald Trump is by far the most hated man in the world's media because of the world's media run by the left and the left hates him more than any\nOf them and if she has a friend the friend is hated\nThose are the two reasons so what are we supposed to do here is the question on the table what are we supposed to do we can't deny and it's because it's it would be a lawyer and you can tell lies can't deny what the Saudi regime that doesn't go up all the way to the crown prince we don't know\nBut it was these are these are pretty well connected man apparently who are engaged in this murder\nSo what are we supposed to do cancel a hundred billion dollars whatever what is this something that they have ordered in in ... five hundred billion right\nThat's a lot of ... that's a lot of jobs so you'll say well as a morale will be more important than jobs which the answer is what is that yes it is yes morality is more important than jobs however there are two big caviar here one is jobs is a moral issue\nIt's not it's not unrelated to morality whether or not we can ... an able tens of thousands of Americans to work\nBut if but murder is burger I I I fully agree I have a hierarchy of moral good and the hierarchy of moral bad it's very big component of my moral thinking\nBut the uh let us say the Saudi regime or toppled because of sanctions by the United states first of all if they didn't have America to buy stuff from they would buy it elsewhere\nThey're not going to stop buying military equipment number two and most important if you really want to talk more old then the greatest moral good right now might be in the world the world scene might be opposing Iran\nIran is the most evil actor on earth the north Korean regime is the most evil regime domestically\nThe Iranian regime is the most evil regime in terms of foreign evil evil outside of its borders\nIt's it's great enemy is Saudi Arabia\nNow you'll say so we are supposed to compromise our values because they're our ally and because the enemy of the ... the enemy is my friend no you don't compromise your moral values you speak out\nYou condemn you try to make that light a more decent place but you don't abandon that ally because there are greater goods the most obvious example being a man of didn't kill one dissident but about twenty five million\nGet that figure because it's not possible for the human mind to wrap itself around it and that is Joseph Stalin and we back Joseph Stalin knowing that he was slaughtering people in the millions because he was on our side against a greater enemy Adolf Hitler\nAnd that is the way the world works for people who are willing to look at the world the way it works knocked the way we imagine we allowed Jimmy Carter allowed the America under Jimmy Carter allowed the shah to step down in Iraq\nBecause of the various things that he did that were bad like his show ...\nThe world a better place because the ayatollah regime took over [noise] the answer is obvious one eighth pray you're Seventy seven six is the number I'm Dennis praying now\nTroubled themselves\nAnd in this case it Saudi Arabia and ironically it's happening when Saudi Arabia is becoming a morally better place that's the irony\nLike\nFeinstein Feinstein wants to reopen Kavanaugh hearings if the Democrats take control of the Senate\nDianne Feinstein has so deteriorated visit moral figure or because of the running against a radical leftist she's just the regular leftist Kevin delay I'm\nSo for her the issue is how do I when\nI was right they will open hearings again on the Supreme Court justice I Want you to understand something about the Democratic party today because it's a left wing liberal party\nEvery institution it doesn't control if wishes to destroy you realize that\nIt doesn't control the electoral college wishes to destroy it\nBecause it wishes to and the electoral college it doesn't control the Supreme Court for the first time in my lifetime and in a lifetime of any of the senators so it calls the court illegitimate that it's a regular phrase\nThe the court there's no longer a Supreme Court is no longer seen as legitimate because it's not left if it's not left it's not legitimate you understand\nIt's a force for chaos left isn't it is a false it just purely a tornado of destruction\nNow ... where was the article about how the Senate protects white voters against black voters and Hispanic voters did you see that\nIt was the Washington Post I think for the bite of been the New York times they hate the Senate because the Senate like the electoral college is state based not population based\nThis is the United states of America the states or to have their own worlds indeed genius I could cry about the genius of the founders of this country\nAnd their genius they wanted competing moral societies as at work ... states to see which one works they didn't they weren't so arrogant just to think they knew exactly what would\nWork really\nThat's why we have ... states\nSo now everything they don't control\nIs illegitimate one eight Prager seven seven six

so ... what what what are the terms of Jackson's presidency or the years to\n... yeah so Li's elected in Eighteen twenty eight so takes office and twenty nine and he's been there for two terms so\nA gun and thirty seven so twenty to thirty seven\nAnd he is when he was he really is it is interesting because he was even early on I mean I Know ... I read it but that\nBut even as a as a boy a he had controversy you were saying that he served as a twelve year old and a Thirteen year old in the revolutionary war which is hard to imagine that a boy right today we don't we just can't imagine such a thing\nAnd that that he was captured by the British as as a as a boy that's right\nAnd and that there was this controversial thing that that he was commanded by a British or a colonel I guess a clean the British officers boots and he refused I mean it's an amazing thing any young boy that's all right would refuse to do something he's a prisoner of war he's a boy what does he Thirteen Years old\nThe ... uh he refuses and the officer slashed at him with a sword\nUh enjoy our scarring him on his head\nIn his hand for life and you think what kind of a human being or would you become if you experienced that as a boy I mean that kind of brutality and then obviously a and the death of his brother and you know it's just another universe is as an excuse or some he did but\nIt's important for us to understand uh you know what life was like a in those days for some people not for all people but certainly for him\nAnd Eric you know I think it's important to note too that he really does come out of that very brutal scotch Irish culture so it's not just that he's on the frontier but his mother who is going to Beijing woman and she died\nCatching a disease helping American sailors and soldiers during the revolution that she gave her life essentially as a nurse but she taught him from day one as scotch Irish children were taught that violence is the way men solve things\nAnd that that was ingrained in Jackson as what so many people have a tendency in Kentucky for ... years it was just very much a part of it\nWell it's just extraordinary I mean I Know that he he lost his mother when he was fourteen a boy and his his brothers and that he blamed the British for that and that's just one of those ... his whole life it shaped\nIran to her for Dave I'm ... yeah it was a guy who held a grudge\nAnd we're we're right ah it it it shapes you a forever\nUm I I Know that we have a photograph of him when he was very very old uh I think it's from Eighteen forty five which is amazing to me to photograph light people you know born uh who who actually served in the revolutionary war doesn't seem possible but so he does kinda span a\nA a these periods a ... it's interesting just to think of somebody who would have been involved in the revolution a who who then lives as long as he does and really comes into another era that area right before the civil war of course\nI knew what a symbol to and you're absolutely right of course he would've had been super young and the revolution\nFor that to happen but it I agree with you there's this guy who is remaining all the way until Eighteen forty five that carries that legacy\nAnd that memory solve one that other generations really watched it the other thing if you don't mind I'll just do this in this play a bit I Love about this generation to what we're talking about adversity John Quincy Adams\nI feel very sorry for them in a lot of ways we we were there the founders the\nFounders were their fathers and you can imagine how can John Quincy Adams ever live up to what his dad did write a letter out great of a guy he was never be John Adams and I think that whole generation clay Webster Calhoun\nBeard desperately trying to prove that they are worthy of the ... and I think it leads to history and a lot of ways but it also I think it energizes them to do crazy things too\nWell it it is interesting I I Know also that he adopted a Native American that's bizarre to me when you think about how he's perceived as somebody who hated the Indians or who was you know a was his policies were catastrophic to Native Americans but that he himself adopted a boy who was a Native American\nYou know his prejudices were funny a funny strange so yes there were certain Indians he just like those certain why she gets like certain Black Sea disliked\nBut in general is rule was you'll never committed an act of violence towards anyone who has a volunteer to be in front of you so if a man wants to do all you that's fine if an Indian by chew that's fine but you never attack women or children ever under any circumstances\nAnd he lives by that rule so he could he was

over again he was a tough a figure it's a really complex I mean I have to say that's why I'm Glad to speak with you about him because\nIt's so easy today and it's so tempting for most people typically people more on the left to demonize people in the past and to compare them to uh where we are today and our standards and that's mostly unfair and it's not just unfair is actually silly because I'm\nEverybody here and you're\nTo continue with the show where we can actually start to show [noise]\nI haven't spoken about to show me the issue [noise]\nAlso to see how it plays out [noise]\nSo obvious but from him was murdered [noise]\nBased on anything anybody can imagine it's indefensible morally indefensible crime was committed against them and\nThere's a lot about the man that I don't know I don't know what his views were used portrayed as a liberal in Saudi Arabia against an autocratic regime\nBut they're all the reports about him but no matter what his views that this is obviously not something we can morally accept the question that looms larger than there however is why is there so much attention being paid here\nDissidents or regime opponents in the middle east are routinely murdered\nOr\n... it's one of the great puzzles of life but I think I have an answer to this one but it is often a puzzle as to why something dominates the news and something else doesn't\nThe Saudi or the Saudi regime got rid of someone wanted to get rid of and now in the year twenty Eighteen this is international news to the extent that it is an ongoing daily story\n\nGiven how many people who who oppose Assad get tortured to death\nOr a\nB ... regime or in other North African regimes other Arab countries of the Muslim countries how many people have been tortured to death in Iran can you mainly one\nSo why why is this so much of a fixation the\nQuestion is not whether or not we accept what happens\nThe question is why is there a fixation on this man well one reason as you wrote columns for the Washington Post so he has a connection to the west and specifically to be mowed studies over is that we have\nPhotographic data\nRegard to I mean a man walks into a consulate and never walk south it's pretty damning where we have that on video we have on video over men and dreams\nAnd we have the information about those men and dream turkey and then leaving turkey so everything is obvious why the Saudi regime or elements of the Saudi regime would want to get rid of this man that's a puzzle to me\nDid you ever hear of this guy ah I'm I immersed myself\nIn world affairs and I've ever heard of the guy and ... and by the way and if you read the columns they're not exactly a\nCent leaving or revealing or or anything I mean it's the Washington Post wanted the Saudi right around a lot of understand that I Wish they had an Iranian writer who was who was a dissident what's a guy would be a dead on arrival the away\nSo here's my theory is why there is such preoccupation with this ban\nAnd there are two reasons in my opinion one is Saudi Arabia's ally of the United states and the the media are far more preoccupied with\nThe bad things that allies do then the bad things that enemies do\nYeah you might want to ask why the call I don't know fully this is this is Dale speculation\n\nThey would I think they would argue we we have influence on allies we don't have influence on enemies\nTherefore on those that we can influence we should try to have some influence\nThat's the most noble read of the preoccupation with the deprivation of allies as opposed to the deprivation of enemies\nRight there's ... there's nothing I'm the dissidents in Iran and when Iran did in fact have an uprising during the\n... during the Obama administration as he essentially said nothing and the the ... that was defended by the entire liberal slash left media because it was ... Obama\nSo back to the question why is there such preoccupation because one one is\nIt you have a moral sense and it's a very important thing for a lot of people to think well of themselves and we we can feel good about ourselves we are bringing to the world's attention\nSomething terrible that an ally of the United states is the second reason\nIs that he's not only an ally of the Saudi regime was not only in LA it'd be six an ally of the most hated man in the world most hated man in the world for the left is about Kim Jong un and it is about the Ayatollah Khamenei me\nA news not the end is not Bashar al Assad is Donald Trump is by far the most hated man in the world's media because of the world's maybe by the left and the left hates him more than one\nAnd if she has a friend the friend is hated\nThose are the two reasons so why are we supposed to do here is the question on the tape what are we supposed to do we can't deny and it's because it's it would be a lawyer and you can tell lies camp that I went to Saudi regime that does does it go up all the way that the crown prince we don't know\nBut it was these are these are pretty well connected man apparently who are engaged in this murder\nSo what are we supposed to do [noise] cancel a hundred billion dollars what what is this something that they ever ordered in in ... five hundred billion right\nSo that's a lot of a that's a lot of jobs so you'll say well listen morale will be more important than jobs which the answer is what is ... ... yes it is yes morality is more important than jobs however there are two big cavity up here one is jobs is a moral issue\nIt's not it's not unrelated to morality whether or not we can ... a ... a a naval tens of thousands of Americans to work but if but murder is murder I I I fully agree I have\nA hierarchy of moral good and the hierarchy of moral bad that's a very big component of ... thinking\nBut the uh let us say the Saudi regime were toppled because of sanctions by the United states first of all if they didn't have America to buy stuff from they would buy it elsewhere\nThey're not going to stop buying military equipment number two and most important if you really want to talk more real than the greatest moral good right now might be in the war on the world scene might be opposing Iran\nIran is the most evil actor on earth\nThe north Korean regime is the most evil regime domestically\nThe Iranian regime is the most evil regime in terms of foreign evil evil outside its borders\nIt it's great enemy is Saudi Arabia\nNow you'll say so we are supposed to compromise our values because they're our ally and because the enemy of the ... the enemy is my friend no you don't compromise your moral values you speak out\nYou condemn you try to make that light a more distant place but you don't abandon that ally because there are greater good the most obvious example being a man of didn't kill one dissident but about twenty five million\nGift that figure 'cause it's not possible for the human mind to wrap itself around it and that is Joseph Stalin and we back Joseph Stalin knowing that he was slaughtering people in the millions because he was on our side against a greater enemy Adolf Hitler\nAnd that is the way the world works for people who are willing to look at the world the way it works knocked the way we imagine we allowed Jimmy Carter allowed the America under Jimmy Carter allowed the shah to step down in Iraq\nWho have their moral compass right and I don't want to say again the murder of cars showcase despicable\nIn life the question is not only correctly labeling bad acts as bad acts it's what do you do about them afterwards\n[laughter]\nThat's that's the way it works on ... in the real world the real world is not pleasant and then the real world you will fight evil with people who are morally\nTroubled themselves\nAnd in this case it Saudi Arabia and ironically it's happening when Saudi Arabia is becoming a morally better place that's the irony\nRight\nFeinstein Feinstein wants to reopen Kavanaugh hearings if the Democrats take control of the sun is\nA lie and Feinstein has so deteriorated visit moral

realize that\nIt doesn't control the electoral college it wishes to destroyed\nBecause in wishes to and the electoral college it doesn't control the Supreme Court for the first time in my lifetime and in the lifetime of any of these senators so it calls the court illegitimate that it's a regular phrase\nThe the court has no longer a Supreme Court is no longer seen as legitimate because it's not left if it's not left it's not legitimate you understand\nIt's a force for chaos left as it is a false it just purely a tornado of destruction\nNow where was the article about how the Senate protects white voters against black voters and Hispanic voters did you see that\nIt was the Washington Post I think but it might have been to New York times they hate the Senate because the Senate like the electoral college is state based not population based\n[noise] this is the United states of America the states or to have their own worlds and be genius I can cry about the genius of the founders of

challenge for the vast majority of people I Would say there's a tiny sliver of people for whom life has been pretty much a walk\nIn the park I knew\nTo such people\nAnd then in the last years were not walk through the park was very it's it's um it's unbelievably rare unbelievably rare\nItself for uh people it's varying degrees of challenge but that's that's the way it is that's the reason I ever happiness hours reason I wrote a book on happy as a result I lecture on it\n'cause if you can bring people to understand certain things than you can increase the happiness and if nothing else at least to have the impact happier because that's a moral obligation not to inflict bad moods upon other people [noise]\nSo today's subject is a as a life change or if you take it seriously\nWe determine how others see us\n\nYeah if you get that people think that some objective reality determines how they are seen by others but the truth is your behavior determines how you were seen by others\n[noise]\nAnd I'll give you an example you you may recall the the show with a remarkable woman\nGaelic Williams who is blind\nAnd who if you meet her\nYou don't think about her blindness you just think about jail\nBecause scale is is charming and Gail is full of life\nAnd death in other words she's not when you when you deal with her you're not thinking the whole time she's blind you're thinking of the whole time she scale\nThere are blind people with whom you would think the whole time that well I'm I'm dealing with a blind person\n\nFear are people who have I'm giving you some pretty dramatic ones and the issue here is not blame or anything like that it is just to tell you the truth about how you are perceived\nAnd I'm going to give you other examples all of them are sensitive by the way everyone was sensitive example another one is the parents who lose a child\n\nThat can become and I'm not blaming or anything else but I'm just describing the reality that can become their identity there so and so she lost her son she lost her daughter he lost the daughter she loved to some\nOr that is part of their by auto biography but it is not the defining element in how they are perceived because that's not what they radiate\nWhen they meet you [noise]\nWhat ever it is you or the one who determines how others see you\n\nBut it's also true we'll give you another example for minorities whenever the minority might be racial\nOr sexual or\nReligious you determine\nBy and large certainly in the United states and the United states you determine how you are perceived if you are a racial minority and you are or your self perception is as a primarily a victim of racism you will be regarded\nAs overwhelmingly a member of that group rather than as job or Susan just take two common American names but probably not that common now frankly\nWant to look up the most common names I should learn what they are and use them now what's the most common birth name of the list are in bed for girls and boys\nThis is this is a big big deal\nYou you are a you are in a religious minority\nYou you are the one who sets the agenda on how the majority will regard you\nKnow people and minorities don't think that way they think that that's how they're perceived the whole time I suspect that there are are we haven't we have the names there the link or the link who need the lingo I mean it was the main but it's okay it's okay you that you\nKnow no no no no no I Know there are a real baby ... dot com and the answer is for\n... minutes okay here we go for I cannot believe that Liam Liam is the number one baby named for boys this past year\n... they don't believe it\nOr why would they make it up [laughter] who is the leader Majid\n[laughter]\nPeople make up the says they are but ... but I don't\nWhy there's a ... it's a it's very sad about number two I Do believe\nFor one\nMinute male female number one is Emma\nI Believe that number two was Olivia\nVery very nice and what is there we go number forty\nIs savannah how many savannah is you know\nAnyway All right so that's what I'll do now for a male okay Liam or ever\nRight go by the way of John even on the list mount\nJak is yeah I Know but I don't know there's no job it's amazing we started to Susan and I'm a list\nThat's got to go to maintain sixty to give to the\nMaple for a wife feel terrific [laughter]\nBen is on the other hand you have to go to the nineteenth century\n[laughter] you\nKnow if it's not there are no young ones died anyway\nYou all the one who sets it you know I I have been since I was in my twenties I have often been in places where I was the only Jew I realized very early on it is up to me to make everybody relaxed\n'cause they ... it was a great it was a great revelation to me\nThat the obligation ironically 'cause I I I Believe Americans have good will and couldn't care less your religious and ethnic racial background doesn't matter you want if you're gay you set the agenda whether do they see you as Liam of\nThat ad or as\nA gay guy you said that agenda\nDo they see you as primarily black or Hispanic or in my case as a Jew or did they see you as Dennis but doesn't\nDeny that you're a Jew doesn't deny if you're a black and doesn't deny if you were gay doesn't deny you if you want every minority group you're rebut doesn't deny it but you don't wear it any more than you where I Am blind or you where I have lost the child\nIs almost impossible for me to overstate the importance of this subject because we have it all back which we think that it's the task of the majority to make the minority person or the person who is different\nFeel great yes to a certain extent but\nWithout their cooperation if they wish to wear their identity that\nMakes them different than they have chosen one aide Prager seven seven six is is big stuff eight seven seven to for three triple seven six we now have a sponsor for the uh for the happiness out
