I'm also going where a political hat for Second Amendment organization where I recently as ... edition of executor a vice president over there\nAnd it makes it a way\nYou got it on the training is that first of all what this guy does he takes a loaded gun he's taken some self eases obviously by excited to be there you know you just you know firearms enthusiast I don't know if he's the owner but he's obviously happy to be there as you do you asked about\nWalks in probably doesn't realize that someone I think his friend that standing there next door has a loaded gun and left it on the counter\nOr in the ... the whole there any indoor ranging reaches down that little counter top cable\nPicks the guy that puts it against his chest points it against what's probably a bullet group well definitely a violation of range etiquette and safety rules as he's probably been briefed on but the ... so it wasn't quite sure what's happening 'cause he's on the other side of the wall jelly starts paying attention this guy takes to sell the if the guy holding the gun in front of his chest\nThen he turns the gun and points it directly into the face of his friend that's all sorts of standing in that cut the whole lane is traditional indoor rink instantly UCD are so come around he reaches up touches him first with his right hand with on the gun in the hand\nPushes it away from the guy's face painted it to the table takes\nHis left hand puts it on the guy's cakes the kind of the guys and pulled them back from the gun to mediate lead a guide for as he says something course we don't have audio\nOr this guy's name is Scott it's at the top gun range and kudos to Scott that he did an amazing job of controlling the gun control in the ocean heat and checks began finds out exploded immediately leaves the gun on the table\nTakes the two gentlemen and starts to escort them immediately from the range from the area of live fire and it was great for met my training at first one of its network at this guy did it amazing job\nAnd I every instructor every hour or so every range facility and by the way every certifying agency out there\nTo ask yourself or your people and argue as individuals if you put yourself in that role prepared to basically control someone in an emergent situation like that far too many aren't\nAnd quite frankly far too many of these uh you know entities that certify instructors actually have a really hard rule they spend more time telling instructors not to touch students without asking permission and eat you know very aware of liability or looking thing awkward or uncomfortable it there's a\nYou know inter gender relationship kind of thing and it's a woman touching a band or and touching a woman there are so worried about the political correctness of it that one of my fears is that they're not reminding instructors interests that you very well may need to go hands on to protect yourself\nAnd to protect others and that's what this are so whose name I only learned off the Internet is David Stott get a great job of\nSo that first for the ... were real quick route route for listeners for your benefit RS always range safety officer Rob go ahead please\nYeah absolutely so you've been there and you took this debt as a as a customer at your range to intervene but you didn't have to go hands on you felt like a verbal you\nKnow hey by the way buddy that's not okay probably at an earlier level or at a lower level of risk of course that's the way to go you know we don't want to touch people we don't need to we don't want physically control people we don't need to but this are so solving need now I'll tell you been on you know I'll be on fifty sixty ranges this year probably been on I don't know if I had to guess\nThree hundred four hundred right around the world in my lifetime he did the right thing\nFrom the political side here's what I saw on the Internet all day long those guys should be banned those guys should be kicked off those guys especially that guy shouldn't have guns\nThat guy should not be allowed back on that range\nI Hope he was banned I Hope that I never see him in another gun video\nAnd I have to ask myself now going to Second Amendment organization putting my political ad on\nIs that the right message let's put think for a minute if the if day the anti ... the other side see that the vast majority of voters leaders are any the guys are going to have a gun\nAre we undermining the credibility of the argument that we should have mandatory training obviously I don't think we should have mandatory training\nDo I think we should encourage change I think we should encourage safe practice is again\nOr choir it in the public space of an indoor or outdoor downright absolutely but what we need to do for a guy like that he died quite frankly that should be banned or rate if he's a behavioral problem that he is either a\nMaturity problem that he has a mental ... intellectual property of understand the ... the part from from guns absolutely but that is strange with but that's an infringement of a second I'm All right\nLet me let me stop you there let me stop you there for a second I'll tell you why because at first I'm thinking\nYou know I I can see the emotional response get those guys the hell out of there there should be banned permanently but what you're saying and what I Want you to understand listeners wait a minute that's not the guy that needs to be bad\nThat's the guy that has a ... he's a he's a lawful gun owner he's got terrible technique in bad faith the habits that the guy that needs to be corrected that's the guy that needs to be on the range taking training\nThat not to be safe gun handling don't take him off the range put him on the range and fix the guy's broken problems\nAt the same time I guess what if you try to but you can't ban in the band from the race but you can't ban it from owning a gun and if you're bad him get ban and promoted a God and he still has a gun you can't go to the rage that we still handling guys like that I'll stop go ahead you got to be\nThat you're spot on you you you channeled the rest of my uh my rent it because I watch the entire day people saying ... this guy off the rain she should have a gun I wouldn't let him in my class\nHey educators a second and then it right at the kids we need we need to grab that guy and and maybe he should be banned from down maybe there's an intellectual or mental issue ... each day yet correct but it's not and I don't think honestly what I've seen I don't think so I think the guy just had no idea what he's doing\nIt and understand the risks probably hadn't been formally trained we need to go back I said we love the fact that you liked yet\nWe love the fact that you're taking selfies with yourself on race you're trying to spread you know ... ... was it it\n... rock pig gives out and credible information real fast working people go to watch that unbelievable video\nOr they might say stuff would you go to Rob a bank is pro Facebook dot com slash Rob Pincus pro I posted it early this morning for consideration and also go to a ...

R. Hawkins things from the word go from the moment Kavanaugh was nominated\nTo right now today\nA W. R. tell us what give us your thoughts on this process\nProcess was horrendous and or the Democrats are shameless what Chuck Schumer spoke yesterday and he said that you know he said Republicans are the ones who came in with an agenda that a short cut this they vilified that they did\nIt he was on the Democrats did all those things that Democrats did everything short of a salt that man and a\n... fine is unbelievable what I think with those things said and I I Can't say anything good about it except a credit to Joe metric for voting for my will say that but\nAh\nYou've got now you have a Supreme Court justice who is show\nThat he will not with the four season that whether under pressure we have a tremendous justice maybe the most conservative justice on the court says Thomas and Thomas is still there or Scalia so it's just like ... that that a vote aspect into that\nWe now at Republican Party that's fired up I mean Lindsey Graham has been better the TV for me and Lindsey Graham\nWhat he did Trump showed the way but he missed it\nAnd then suddenly adult on and get ... and he corrected is air and the way is cheap all people\nCast all the politically correct chains and the moment you do that but left is no power over here they have not\nWhen you cast them off you suddenly realize what these people can do to me they've just been forcing me to cower in my corner and as soon as he cast them all he turned it made a mockery of the very people who used to crazy and so I think we as we have a justice was going to be unconditional\nOr in his love for the second amendment ... poetry party it may have finally learned how to fight it\nIt's true and if we have those things under President Trump then Katy bar the door here but go\nBoy I tell you a whole lot of meat in that let me let me take let me take two things that you that you mentioned that were great and for all of it was and you're a student of this stuff and that's why I wanted to ask you this I Know you study this you read this you watch this you ingest it you inhale it you breathe that I mean I Know this is who you are\nSo let's let's sort or another round of beers here and some more chicken wings make mine hot please\nAnd um another cold glass a W are you just mentioned mansion and you said God Bless him for voting this way let me throw something else that you and I want to get your comments on this\nThe hell with matching mentioned needs to go mansions not a man mentioned couldn't stand up man she'd have to wait to see how Susan Collins voted before he could vote now the reason I say this is because West Virginia you're listening right now\n[noise] why couldn't man should have said that before Collins voted\nBecause magic is playing politics with this vote he had to wait to get political cover so he could still it was okay was humor\nThat he could get away with it because once Collins said I'm a go nothing could hurt mansion at that point in other words I'm telling you mentioned the plane you for a damn bowl tell me if I'm wrong W. R.\nThough you're right on that I Would I Would suggest the other was all that but I'm just saying I Am glad he crossed over the call right\nNow when Kathy Griffin road map on Twitter which she can't quit doing uh she's just angry I think she's angry at how she looks at it wouldn't be I think she's angry at how she sounds like she's angry at our careers dolls\nAnd uh when she does that you can tweet or say you wasn't great that that he was concerned with bipartisan support it they'll never be able to take that away from\nThat right about you're you're right you're absolutely correct about that I had to throw some devil's advocate out there I I got to be honest with you mentioned I think West Virginia it's time for you to wash your clothes you need a conservative in there you don't need somebody that you need somebody that's going to stand up and\nSay you know what I don't vote lock step with Chuck Schumer you know what you need you need to be like Murkowski on your side of the fence about an hour to\nGet right on the west Virginia West Virginia have the votes are more see there's no doubt about it yeah I'm not suggesting otherwise I'm not even just the people should think otherwise I'm just saying what ... did and I agree with your heart that political what did you take a position of\nJelly knew that that position wouldn't hurt him politically but but what he ended up doing is giving us the opportunity to look at you described it and you spray and say hey isn't it great that he was confirmed ... bat or\nOr you're absolutely correct you're you're correct and I wasn't insinuating that you were suggesting otherwise I just wanted to throw that I'll mention 'cause he's so easy to Iraq I'm going to go into him and the next hour when I'm On my own and have some fun with them now\nGraham oh boy you know we talked last week about gram off there and I think that Lindsey Graham has woke use the Urban Dictionary term right I think he's woke what I Want to know from you is what took so long why could you I and others and gun owners are\nReal conservative see this ten years ago and he couldn't or others couldn't or McConnell couldn't or other Republicans why and you got about a minute\nI don't know I have thought on this and part of me think and I'm just this is only my opinion part of me thinks that the influence of McCain work that great on him because he and McCain were that close that really that's really all I can come up with me number I but I Will tell you what\nIt don't matter what it was I Love the Lindsey Graham I'm seeing right now and I made it the guy is awesome\nAnd he you know I Love when he ran for ... when he ran for president under or when but I Love when you said we need the bomb these beliefs I Can't use the word I don't think our regular radio he talked about how bad we needed to bomb a ISIS and the other people and what he was going to do to them there's always been a fireball\nHe's just been too moderate in true true held back and now that he's let go everything woke as you say I Love the guy just loved it\nI I agree I was the last twenty seconds before the break I I'll I'll I guess I'll just kind of put a period on that and say that I Believe that Lindsey Graham always believed or wanted to see the best in the other side and I think it took this and McCain that I I think you're right about that\nTo wake him up and say you know what these people over there and not not France they're not not friends if they would do that to justice Kavanaugh they would do that to me and I think I think he realizes that and that woke him up to the point where I don't believe you're going to see Lindsey Graham play nice nice anymore\nAnd that's the only way I can tell you because we knew\nFor me I just don't like it inside the waste Spain carry highest or a a unless it's extremely small or whatever and ... but then when you realized is with the cross breed\nLots of super tug does everything has a purpose it's not it's not wider than a normal host or because they're sloppy it's not taller than another host or because they're sloppy or didn't plan it out it dissipates the presidents and later that gun and when you put that ... on you will forget you're carrying a gun\nAnd uh you know I don't mean that reckless fashion obviously that's the kind of comfort we're talking about I found that same comfort with ...\nYou know yeah and the outside the waste man it's it's really true I got to take this reminder\nTo tell the story about this about mark I have to because it's a great story I did a commercial for them I ... a TV\nPiece or camera peace with them telling the same story but\nOf market hurt me talking mark credit and founder of cross breed of the many years ago had heard me talking about how I it'd be simply given up on WB inside the waistband Kerry from my full size gun I just couldn't find anything that works I got a number of great manufacturers and a number of great super high quality ... they just were not working for me\nAnd he heard me swear off on that and you heard me say I was lucky I Lived in Georgia and outside the waistband Carey was not going to be a problem and\nHe called me and he said wait don't give up let me send you this holster\nAnd I want you to try this and what you do me if they want you to get up when you get up in the morning at seven thirty more time you get up I Want you to put it on and what you put your gun in it and when she worked for twenty four hours don't take it off and that's exactly what I did I got the whole story on Saturday I went to work and broadcast it on a Sunday put that thing on seven thirty in the morning I wore it\nAll day long broadcast it and it came back and as I Want to do on Sundays after the monster show a W I fell asleep on the couch woke up about seven o'clock the next morning forgot I had it on until I got up went upstairs and take a shower that's how comfortable that holster was but then I told I told that story\nMany many many times and and I know that you you experienced then I thought it was just a cool story to tell I called markets you God thank you he said I Want to participate on your show I said You're welcome to and we've been to cross breed holster studios ever since its just are remarkably design a piece of equipment and we've got thirty seconds did you want to close it out real

way they're put together every day or at least ... is a winner and that's the bottom line what you're inside the waistband or outside the either way you go snaps lied or super taught so winter\nAnd I'll tell you it regardless to of what gun you carry I've I've got a whole slew of guns in my safe and I have a cross breed for virtually every single one of them\nAnd it doesn't matter whether it's

wonderful story rich in American history this is a company that was built and survive on a God is it any shock to anyone that Wells Fargo would continue to do business with us\nWould that shock anybody at all it doesn't shock me at all\nWhy would it shocked you what do you think\nYou know ... ... knots or trigger history which they fear that they are\nI missed Wells Fargo for crying out loud of course they're going to lead the gun industry some money good heavens wants that you you say what what shot and you said\nI bank rhythm you back with them yeah yeah I've got some business interests with them over there a little bit All right let's go back to some age I think I just think that's fascinating stuff and I appreciate your writing about it in the history of it is it's fascinating to me\nAll right we've got the armed customer over there we talked a little bit about him I Know I got to go to a this guy is Seventy four year old Vietnam that\nWho wanted\nThis this guy shot seven ... seven cops\nBut killed one wounded six\nAll right do we know anything about this at this stage of the game\nYou know or you know I I'll probably know in the morning a cabin all just sucked up the air so much\nFriday Saturday it it's it's certainly did go ahead\nBut yeah this uh\nThis is a weird situation they were going to bed house surf or in a very upscale neighborhood the war was not for the Seventy four year old Vietnam that it was four twenty seven year old male and the house or in the war was on suspicion of child molestation or or child sexual assault something like that\nJust so weird to me that\nThe person who was not the target of the search warrant open file a place and uh you know there's there are dogs to be connected here but um [noise] this one of those stories it sound news works it's one of those stories it happened\nUh it just happened to happen the day before the Kevin Oh just suck the era of the room and uh so everything everything Kavanaugh was getting ... so let's just put it that way and so uh I'll Try to do a follow on this law is\nI'd be curious to find out about what some of those dots are it's a very strange story and we've got seven police officers in South Carolina that was shot one killed one of them Thirty years on the job unbelievable I don't want to find out what happened there All right I'm I'm just curious ah Russia collusion Mahler oh where's that then\nI haven't heard any backed\nUp that bring that back up now that Kevin though you know once they get out because I get done staying in in the kitchen or wherever they are and and you whip and themselves with all changed or whatever else they're doing once they're done with that it'll go back to Russia collusion and all the stuff that's not real\nOr just to try to keep it going but you know what I'm going to say mark you remember during Sandy Hook or the you remember I I hate to use the word there was a two year old a part of gun owners that you know there was another one\nWill go to push through gun control but they they overreached as usual and they showed their hand everybody figured out hold on these people are an African involves that'll make a difference there just after more control I think\nThey did the same thing with what they did the Kevin though and I believe that when they circle back for Russia now and when they circle back for all the other things now they're going to have a lot of trouble getting any kind of sympathy especially the can they weren't getting maybe say even six seven weeks ago it's over\nThere and I I think there are good Bailey proven they're they're just a bunch of animals that's all\nAnd I think their credibility I think they've shown that their credibility ... as I talk about it and you know this you do too I Know you talk about it on your podcast and the two of us has spoken about with Curt Schilling on his show we've discussed it here on this program over the last couple of years\nAnd that is that the Democrats and the media in particular has shown that all they're doing is driving and pushing a narrative they they're they're they're they're shaping the news the way they want you to get it then they move away from it they don't cover it any more because they choose not to and then all of a sudden they're going to try to go back and I think what's going to happen is\nThat the rest of America who doesn't have their head in this stuff neck deep like we do every single day is going to look back when they circle back around to it said well wait a minute here\nUm\nWhy is that news again their credibility is in the toilet and I think it'd be very difficult for them to drudge that back up and I'm sure Miller a mother is probably real ticked off about that because his Fifteen minutes for probably about up\nBy ... ears are there's a link\nTo it for those who are paying attention not only really to say it but I'm the say the early ... winter Trump won the election\nTrump got Gorsuch on Trump got Kevin on Trump cut our taxes Trump is build up the military to an ... unbelievable strength levels on and on I like to go use air my mocked him when he tried to use tariffs doesn't understand economics and then what happens\nNow he's got a deal Canada and Mexico and China's coming around but he doesn't understand anything say so Trump is a winter and I think\nThat combined with the fact that the Democrats just show themselves that deal destroy a good human\nInforming hand ever training responsibly our citizens from coast to coast here is your host farms American radio\nBars Walter\nMurphy radios ... our\nThree about Alan's out leave an hour or one of your office an hour or\nTwo they bring it don't say they always do let me tell you something it's gets lost on us a lot I think because we begin as I Know I Do as a human being you probably do as a human being you begin to take certain things for granted Alan Gottlieb and W. R. Hawkins are two of the best of the best at what they do\nAlan Gottlieb is by far the single most important single most important\nLiving breathing fighter on behalf of the right to keep and bear arms then there is anywhere else on planet earth today no one else is more important\nNo one is more important than Allen got even we're proud to have him as a regular contributor it W. R. Hawkins also with Breitbart News award winning\nPutting out the facts counterbalance thing and it's not just say W are there are many many many writers out there for many organizations many outlets and all the good conservative writers out there but I W our\nFocus is unlike the rest strictly and purely on the right to keep and bear arms and we have him here also as a regular political column a political analyst every single week here on armed American radio very proud of that you guys do this on their own time\nAnd they can bring so that they can bring their writings and their words of wisdom and their information to you to help act as a counterweight to all the garbage that we hear so obviously are these two guys meet a lot to me let me tell you a little bit about\nWhat's happening next week and I will be at the Arizona citizens defense league meeting in Phoenix on Saturday and on flying out\nOn friday and just about five or six days\nFive days and that's assuming that the newest tropical storm about looks like it's going to be way past me by friday anyway but nonetheless you never know\nHopefully everything works out okay and I get out of here on time where I'm going with this is I I leave for Phoenix friday mid morning get out the Phoenix late in the morning\nAnd I have some meetings scheduled for friday afternoon radio station in a number of other a number of other things I've got to cover while I'm Out there quickly and then Saturday I Will be attending the Arizona citizens defense league meeting\nIn the morning most of the day anyway it's a lunch in meeting this thing is unbelievable off you're attending this if you're listening now in Arizona in any station that plays in Arizona where you're coming out to that ... that meeting and beautiful Phoenix I look forward to meeting you is the first time\nI've been asked to speak at this meeting I Love it I kind of invite myself I'm a ... I'm a lifelong member or a lifetime member of the studio and I really look forward to this grassroots meeting this is one of the organizations\nOutside Georgia carry maybe the CCD a\nVirginia citizens the the the L Virginia says the ... the deals that caught myself with this\nBut the the the the group at Arizona citizens the fence lake fights a legislative battle expertly unlike any other group I've ever met except for maybe Virginia citizens defensively and Georgia Kerry\nAnd to be honest with you I think all three of these organizations have fed off of themselves now on Saturday when I'm Out there I'm bringing a surprise with me to the meeting that's all I can tell you if you're coming and you're listening to my voice now\nYou don't want to be there and you want to come up and shake my pie I promise you the [laughter] that much I can tell you but here's what's fun\nAbout going to Arizona next week I have an opportunity next week to use some new technology really a task I gave it up I gave it to work out at the gun rights policy conference and was able to get\nGas on the program by taping them live\nAs they were coming off the stage at the gun rights policy conference and then bringing you the interviews the next day on armed American radios monster broadcast I Am going to attempt to do the same thing in Arizona\nWhile I Am there on Saturday there stars there are just some amazing people who otherwise I Would not have an opportunity to bring on this program\nFor lots of different reasons\nThat I Will be able to sit down with face to face and the beauty of it is the new technology I'm referring to provides incredible studio quality audio on site\nUsing simply my laptop and a couple of little very cool gadgets and some of the of course the professional studio microphones to utilize\nBut by ... by a by taping this deal is I don't need to worry about using the studio in and bring got signed by having them contact in the studio were able to do this one on one it it opens up tremendous possibilities\nFor me and the program down the road to bring you a lot of guest appearances that we might not been able to have been able to make to work out for example\nNormally to tape a broadcast which we don't generally like to do if I Want a taping a specific interview to bring to you because maybe somebody can't be at a certain time and can't be on the air with me at a certain time we're able to tape that segment\nThat requires an individual to be in the studio in Dallas that requires me to be available and it requires them to be available at a certain specific time everybody is scheduled to have to expensive and it's time consuming\nWhat we have at our fingertips now you gotta love technology has the ability to eliminate having to utilize that studio and not bring that studio directly to my laptop and enabled me to bring to you studio super high quality\nAudio worthy of a national broadcast on two hundred plus radio station we would do it no other way hence why we haven't done it unless we had the studio available to us we can now do these things so I Am hopeful\nThat really what worked out for CGI our PC we're going to elevate that\nTo the next level out as I'm Out of the Arizona citizens defensively meeting here's the fun part of absolutely no idea\nWho I'm gonna bring to you one person in particular who works that room like a champ\nAnd I hope to bring to you would be of course Allen Corwin I Will be spending some time with Alan Corwin at the Arizona citizens defense leak meaning he's very busy working and stable doing his thing as you can imagine he's very very popular at the studio meetings and they have to gun shows the crossroads of the west coast shows\nBut I Am hopeful to be able to bring Allen Corwin to you among many others while I'm Out there for the Sunday show yeah and that's the fun part I don't even know now start working on that we can progress is\nBut right now I don't even know there are so many amazing voices and I don't even know yet who some of the special guests are\nOut there who are going to be some of the keynote two or three keynote speakers are going to be I'm One of probably thirty people that will be taking the stage out there I'll be given about ten minutes\nBut I'm there to see the keynote just like everybody else has and I don't know who that is going to be yet I'll find out tomorrow when I started doing some more research I haven't had time to really dig into that I'll be looking into that this week but whoever it is\nI'd be I've sat next to you know it was the former state's attorney general out there at those lunch and meetings before who are nationally known that worked in presidential administrations et cetera state senators\nOr you know Congress people are so who knows I have no idea Arizona citizens defense is a powerful organization that makes waves across the country and implicit let me tell you something I could you not what I tell you that they are at the tip of the spear\nIn this fight against Michael Bloomberg\nNew York's obnoxious multi billionaire gun grabber and gun hater who surround himself with private security arm to the teeth\nWhile he decried as your right to harm yourself to defend yourself and your family hypocrite\nIs does the word that doesn't even got satellite radio moment word is\nWhat I Would have to use to define Michael Bloomberg at that point but ABC\nThose are the tip of that's here they have taken some preemptive strikes\nIn our legislation in with legislation\nIn their state legislature over the last couple of years because they know that Bloomberg\nHas Arizona in the cross hairs coming up in twenty eight team through twenty twenty and a lot of it is going to be dependent on what happens in Washington state was sixteen thirty nine the ballot initiative up there because Arizona is also a ballot initiative state as Florida\nYou have got to be paying attention if you are one of the Twenty one states across the country\nThat has a is that is a ballot initiative state you had better be paying attention Arizona knows they're dead center of the crosshairs and they've been working for Bloomberg in advance of what they know it was coming for the previous two years\nSo I'm fascinated to find out more when I get out to Phoenix this coming weekend so it's going to be one heck of a show out there at easy CDL and I'm looking forward to bringing you some voices that don't generally come on this program with this new technologies and I have\nEnables me to bring super high quality high definition audio to you as if they were sitting in a studio with me or calling into the studio in fact it's even better because they're my up with me so it it just is is the top of the line top notch stuff cutting edge and I'm proud to have it at my at my fingertips for you so\nAh next weekend that's what's happening coming up in the next three quarters we're going to next three segments I'm Sorry for the next three quarters of an hour we're going to go over what happened this previous week and talk about just how important it really was but\nI Want to get a little bit personal with you in the next segment because this\nWeekend marks one year an armed American radio ranch when I sat down with you and opened\nAnd here we are one year later giving you some of the greatest news I possibly could and I think each and every one of you individually\nFor your thoughts and your prayers and you're well wishes it meant the world and it's hard to believe it was one year ago this very weekend that we were that we were given that news in just two days well I'll tell you\nI Know you may very well have gone through something like this uh most people do at some point or know someone who has\nIf you have questions if you want to talk with me about if you want to to correspond with me about it\nAnd the things that I went through as a as a husband has a father I more than happy to open up to you reach out to me please market armed American radio dot O. R. G. as many many many of you have and I'll be more than happy to help you in any way that I can you help to me and trust me\nI've got your back on this one I bought my whole family does so\n[noise] hard to believe that was a year ago that we were sitting around this very weekend waiting for the worst news of our lives it was just it was awful\nBut the best possible outcome in in large part because of you to affect you All right\nOh but I did mention in the in the previous segment it was exactly one year ago that I sat and spoke with you it wasn't I I we when we found out what was happening at armed American radio ranch it was about three weeks later when we knew of course of treatment when we knew what we were faced with\nEt cetera is when I sat down with you and I talk with you about it and I'll tell you why I did that I Want to remind you of that again\n\n... was one year ago this weekend we got the news or were awaiting the news got the news on Tuesday it was about three weeks later that I opened up to you to tell you what had happened and here's why\nThat's my wife and I sat in that room at the radiologist\nScared to death knowing something was coming back not knowing what it was\nIt was easy to say this can't be happening is that just cannot be happening this is not happening to us and I had\nTo remind my wife during a conversation when she said this is a quarter she said this is a nightmare it's just can't be happening is that\nIt is happening\nAnd it is happening to you and it is happening to us and if you and us and we as a family are going to defeat this we have to accept what's happening you cannot refuse to accept the situation\nThis is the same exact concept that we speak about on this program together every single day even if we don't have to touch on it as a topic\nYou cannot begin to take your own personal self defense seriously if you do not first except that evil exists you must accept that evil exists an evil takes many forms we've discussed it over and over and over again\nAnd it's easy just\nAs you hear someone say I cannot believe\nThat this happened to me that my house got Rob that I was a victim understand that the first step and defeating evil is accepting its very existence then and only then can you give evil what it needs and that's a good solid\nButt kicking and you can put first you must accept that it can happen to you we found out at the ranch [noise] and that's how we defeated it with a lot of help from the back after this [noise]\nAre you a responsible person to find yourself going deeper and credit
