{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "Uh but but but Trump is a sort of a less ideological a president and maybe they're kind of okay what's the way things are going now let me add one more thing or these not so ideological groups of voters maybe they watched some of the Kavanaugh hearings and their basic sense of fairness\nWas just eat what enormously offended as this fine man had his reputation destroyed\nBy most thread bear of accusations and they did not like the dog and pony show put on by Democrats like Cory Booker Dianne Feinstein Richard Blumenthal and they watched Lindsey Graham rise up and righteous indignation they said you know what Lindsey you're\nRight I'm going to vote for people like you know what I've just described is that maybe a million or two people maybe and if that's the case then\nWhat makes a very good Tuesday night actually\nYeah it it sure well what what I was ... what I'm hoping that that occurs and district a house races 'cause I think that's what's important but thank you so much for ah your opinion on that\nI have is my pleasure thank you thanks and best you know and and go ... go tigers whether it's closer and closer usa to written for their it'd be a whatever portion of South Carolina here at the don't confuse those to\nLearn about that I'm In the house is the battleground we are going to pick up and said you know how the Senate goes Senate has a hundred people six year terms so every two years about a third of the Senate goes up for grabs\nNow just so happens the way the maps drawn this time it's a bunch of states that Trump won\nA bunch of states that Trump won the Democratic senators to for the moment like your West Virginia yet ... Indiana you're North Dakota Montana you're Missouri well every single one of those Democrats senators said just may not be long for this world electorally speaking\nAnd there maybe Republicans were going to take over those seats and maybe even more maybe John James in\nMichigan it's easier to beat Debbie Stabenow if you guys have your act together he will so building that don't make that happen is Menendez going to lose in New Jersey he will if we have our act together so go do that don't make that happen make history in the Garden State go do that\nNo matter what you live off of in Jersey do do that return Bob Menendez a private life it can happen that\nWill we get seven or eight brand new a Republican senators or or more like four or something in between I dunno but it'll be something that will be a more Republican Senate than it is now and over in the house\nOver in the house listen let's let's go ahead and take a look at the at the numbers on this\nIn these midterms what you've got is obviously a house of representatives that contains four hundred and thirty five people write\nThe margin right now is Republicans to thirty six Democrats one Ninety three and they're sick vacancies right to thirty six one Ninety three to when you got to have to Eighteen\nAnd it just so happens right now is that about two hundred are solid Democrat or lean Democrat\nMaybe a little more than ... her about two hundred are solidly Republican or lean Republican maybe a little less than two hundred maybe two oh five one Ninety five so in the middle there are about thirty some that are toss ups\nThirty some that are toss ups and it's let's say it really is two hundred two hundred that leaves thirty five and all we need is Eighteen of those thirty five now all we need I Know yeah [laughter]\nCan we do it you that we can if the kind of mood is the kind of outrage but we saw from non ideological people to to things I'll tell you to things that will help make\nTuesday night a magnificent night for conservatism a magnificent night for liberty a magnificent night for the constitution great night for Trump of course and that's lovely to but I Want a great night for you\nAnd for me and for people who believe in strong borders and lower taxes and and a constitutional list Supreme Court justices and who don't believe in impeachment dog and pony shows that making Nancy Pelosi speaker again and\nPutting Maxine Waters and a powerful position given Jerry Nablus and House Judiciary weaken annoy us with impeachment a drama for two years no we Must Rise up and say no to that\nTwo things will help it happen really ... really motivated\nIdeological voters real conservatives getting off the couch and striking a blow for conservatism X number one and number two\nIs folks who might not even be that ideological they don't spend all day maybe listening to shows like this are watching Fox News or watching anything and they're they're just they just look at the country and they say you know what the country seems to be doing better and maybe that means that Trump's doing a great job and maybe that means I Need to vote for people to St party is him\nIt's basic logic they'll do that and we'll have a Big Mac in eight and eight days Mark Davis in from Iraq I listen to\n\nHere here's the key eighty percent of the people who try the release factor quick start by again\nTake David from Pennsylvania because what he said\nI tried relief factor for hip pain and I was surprised but it also help relieve my shoulder and foot discomfort\nNow after taking it for a month I stopped and sure enough the pain returned my foot discomfort came back to where I started taking relief factor again and within a week the pain was relieved I now understand it I get it I'm now taking relief factor daily [noise]\nNow your body is already fighting inflammation also known as the silent killer a hundred million Americans suffer from the information to try and do something about it tried to three week quick start Nineteen dollars in Ninety five cent Ninety five cents a day less than a cup of coffee a day for pain relief\nJust go to relieve factor dot com relief factor

to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to manage share where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared\nAll our bells and it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without

AOL dot com M. A. R. K.\nI. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com which many of you've done over the years and I really appreciate that fact have you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis prayer or Larry Elder\nAs I did last friday but what a privilege to be able to fill in for both the gentleman although I must admit I intentionally used Facebook and Twitter much less now I don't think I ever barely touched Twitter anymore you know how far left\nAnd biased they are that Facebook has its own thing with you know you get in touch with people you have known for years or seen for years or heard from but I don't know I mean it's so clear what side of the spectrum there on and that makes a difference [noise] but in the news you add to have heard about their risk murders at a Pittsburgh synagogue\nIt's hard to imagine that you go pray and be with your God and your fellow worshippers and you were emerge purely because of your face and it's it's just incredible not unlike when you go to your church and you were murdered purely because of your skin color\nOr you were threatened or attempted murder is committed because of your political persuasion\nThey all have one thing in common\nThey make no sense except when you understand there's evil in the world committed by evil and deranged people [noise]\nThat people are not born good and this is seems to be a battle with those who are I don't know religious from those of us who are secular\nAnd if people are left to their own devices ... horrible crimes\nAs genocide or slavery so from the very beginning you write we teach our children that you know not every toys their talking I always love it when you go to a party and um it's your kids or someone else's birth to part of the kid goes and do your kids watch every toy\nThat the birthday kid has because they haven't been taught right they grow up selfish everything is about them when they're babies everybody's a doting on them and Tony over them so that's a key difference certainly between\nI think not only the religious and secular but the left and the right to people are not basically good\nDid you hear all the time with the left that oh you know you got to be understanding of the murder or you got to be understanding of their background and stuff well yeah the there's a real issue about whether the people would be good if left to their own devices and what is Dennis always called something about the Germans tribes I think in Eighteen century\nOr they were so powerful and committed such evil and that the answer was because they could\n[noise] so it's important to have guardrail were good behaviors are defined and bad behaviors are outlawed\nOutlawed or even more importantly\nProhibited by by God's will have to answer to that that that is so crucial because if you don't think there is something or somebody that we have to answer to win this is all over it than anything goes right into your own moral compass that counts and\nYeah there are a lot of good people that have good morality and then you know they would never hurt anybody but I don't trust that I that otherwise you would never get slavery otherwise you would never get genocide\nYou can't leave people to their own devices so that's why we have laws but even more importantly if you think there is a good job that you're going to answer to win this is all over I think that produces ... much better but I think it's obvious\nUh so that's why I say born could behaviors or to find them bad behaviors are outlawed or prohibited by a God that you have to answer to [noise] so what do we have we had fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers and sons and daughters they did not come home Saturday\nYou know you you are you ... talk and you think you have some sanctuary to use that phrase and that and what was his two brothers I mean you I Can't even watch or listen to the details 'cause it's too depressing\nAnd a lot of them older right it is just that you know they go about their business they don't bother anybody else and purely because of their religion\nThey are murdered by an evil guy who made it very clear right he's anti Semitic you know all Jews should be killed I guess is what he's you know I'm paraphrasing what was going on purely because\nI think he was upset because they were uh you know part of the group that was helping immigrants come into this country even illegal immigrants and you'll hear my position I'm sure during the day about illegal immigration one could\nBe outraged about politics and not do what antifa does not do what the pipe bomb or does whatever side he wants to being on it it looks like he was on the you know the other side but who knows\nIt doesn't matter evil is evil matter what you want to say\nBut it's hard to imagine the pain of it all\nBut ... I Will you know the difference Dennis ... leave religious discussion for him when he when he gets back\nNo one is better than Dennis on that in my opinion but I sure hope\nThat there is good God waiting for them and that family members can find some solace that way\nI Want to know your thoughts at one aide Prager seven seven six but worst part is probably not the worst part worst part is what happened to these people but I mean and I don't mind issue here is what the media and others have tried to do to blame Donald Trump\nThat he's a he's the atmosphere that he\nHas not only accepted but uh you know in some way encourage\nHas led to evil as if it's first of all is if it's only on our side right they conveniently forgot Steve's beliefs and and that the guy there were it was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nAs I remember and he he committed total mayhem right if not for the Capitol police that happened to be there when some of the congressmen he would have wiped them all let alone Steve's police who you know almost succumb to his injuries but to do and I saw it all over the place there was a a\nFormer Obama official interviewed on Fox News let alone or the guy didn't even challenge from the news hosts on the weekend didn't even challenged him when he said oh you know comes from the top down and the kinds of things he says and it kind of things he encourages his supporters to do that's why we have this kind of violence\nWhen it's been going on for ever not to mention that and and you certainly uh you can't just blame the president for any particular supporter of his that commits man whether it's a pipe bomber or in fact this guy I think once of being anti Trump my right he's ... he's on the other side it doesn't matter\nThere have to get the president at every turn whenever he does is got to be bad and it's part of the you know he he's the worst president never should have been elected uh he's evil he's a bumbling fools all those characterizations they hate him with a passion\nSo everything that happens in this country that is bad is President Trump's fault and everything that happens that is good that's further bombs credit to his credit if you don't believe that just asking they'll tell you that\nSo this is what we have going on and you can't avoid politics even in something so awful here and even some of the rabbis there was a march\nIn my neck of the woods in the San Fernando valley and you could just hear at all which is the spirit of the country and it's the encourage meant the kind of thing from the even if they didn't say his name you know who they were talking about and\nI Know what happened I bet you all of you out there and knew that it would happen that one way or another they were going to blame him for anything that happened including people who are against him none of it matters and we'll get into this later I I think in this first I Want to talk about the media and the press\nOh what they've done to this present butter relates here relates here to these family members um that will never come home again because\nOf anti Semitism um look this is the greatest country in the history of the world but there are going to be evil people in it they're all going to be crazy people there are going to be this is what I say a two blacks who say that as a you know hatred and bigotry against them and\nUh the racism in this country yeah you you can't outlawed you can't get rid of it totally they're always going to be people like that\nAnd there's nothing you can do you just ... and here's the other thing in this horrible incident ... luck plays a a a lot in life that if the you know I think some there's always someone who doesn't go for some reason and then they have to think the rest of their lives why wasn't of my time [noise]\nSo it it it's very difficult as I said and you you can't imagine what these family members of going through um ... it and it's not just them is the remember the black church\nWhere the guy comes in whatever his name was any they just kills people because they're black which is meaningless being black tells you nothing about someone\nOr being Jewish tells you nothing about their values and who they are being Christian right Christians are under attack in this country that's the one group that it seems to be okay you can attack them you can get away with it right 'cause it's okay in this country\nIs it's very depressing and that leaves me back to politics that's why the President Trump so much because he's willing to stand up for a stand up for our values\nUm say things the way they are which is what we've been waiting for forever for Republicans to have some church so of course the left the liberals the media it's all the same thing to me of course there outrage within an Scorsese responsible for everything bad there's nothing you can do that's good because he's just label it don't you always feel you're\nAnd we've now found out through the corruption of the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for her actions and the price to lock her up represent the Irish people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people wanted him to go to jail no he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that this one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so lot corrupt is not by any means and incitement to violence the other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially annoyed with the charge that they are the enemy that people\nThere'd be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and they're beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate the press not infrequently comes out with stores that are not true the latest example here this one NBC was hiding spoke tore evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's it's a cute one it's a good way it seems NBC knew that you didn't even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engage in gang rape you didn't hear that John\nI think I got something on Johnny didn't hear that bit of news yeah this so called serious offense is not outraged if you examine it from President Trump's respect for many of his supporters\nThe media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so if they're no longer objective reporters and are partisans of the left which they have become\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy to the detriment of the truth so for example well talk about and the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother\nNever mentioned the fact that none of this would happen if the mothers didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that\nOr the more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone who's guilty of a crime cash this their children are also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother or father [noise]\nHow come that hardly ever reported by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener so the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she was on Fox News even though he's more picked on them\nAnd saw at all it's all they lacked the proper documents to come to this country or your house or take your bank account they just don't have the right documents\nSo of course many people never hear the other side of issues if the press barely reports then so in that sense they're an enemy of the people because they're denying all the facts to the people and not allowing them to make their own decisions let me know what you think I think this is a big part of the issue these right he's not even\nLet me know what you're saying one a ... mark

radio network in the last hour we certainly talking about risk the shootings at the temple and and then it's kind of evolved into a\nPeople blaming is certainly the media and of course the Democrats left it's all the same thing these days blaming President Trump for the pipe bomb or bomber blaming President Trump for the shootings at the temple\nIt never ceases to amaze me that everything that goes on that's bad it's his fault and um even in the most serious charges against and the one I think the most offended up being the press is that the people\nNow that the ... the enemy of the people which I think they are because they don't report the news objectively and that was basic to our founding that they'd be a free press are reporting the facts and not giving into government figures that they agreed with\nAnd make it easier like they did on President Obama and by the way speaking President Obama he said some awful things to that could incite people like me normally column met her people like my son we have that clip let's play\nIt shouldn't be democratic\nYou don't punish political opponents of putting the freedom of press just because you don't like what they say you're right\n\nHow to save him a radical Republican [laughter]\nWe don't target people based on how\nHow [noise] some\n[noise] I Love you know but I'm not going to run [noise] you know what\nThat there are a compassionate conservative\nThink that there is nothing compared to about\nImmigrant children from their mother\n[noise] and those\nSo why isn't bad inciting people to violence you see how he says so passionately and ... is the anger in his voice as that and see if people on my side let alone President Trump that were against people based on how they look or how they pray daily\nWhen did that first happened I didn't I must have missed that or when he was looking for the compassionate Republicans right he really needs to Republicans that don't stand up for themselves but I Love the last one because I was going to talk about illegal immigration in this hour\nRipping immigrant children not no it's not illegal immigrants but ripping immigrant children and talking about from the cold cells running them\nOut of the arms the mothers or fathers and and you know however you put a I'm paraphrasing and they wind up in a in a coal sell how isn't that incitement on his side for some ... yeah you do that to children away from their parents we better do something about how come when he knows that it's OK\nHow come when he he actually is lying about opposition worst President Trump lie I Want you to\nPoint that out in terms of politics I think that there is nothing compared to\nImmigrant children from their mother\nLeaving them in a cold sell cars that makes me pretty angry how come it's not on their side\nThat that that's OK when they do but it's only President Trump you see the visceral hatred for this president\nAnd as I mentioned on Larry show friday you know the reason for\nIt because we finally have a Republican who standing up to the other side who doesn't let them get away with anything look\nLike you I'm I'm not thrilled with everything he says is Dennis as you get the total package with everybody but\nThe fact is they hate him to hate him with a passion because finally someone standing up to them that's what I think someone is really not letting them get away with it remember John McCain to do anything about president bombing he didn't want people to even mention the fact\nThat he may have been you know the way he talked about the America should I Apologize and you know the issue about where he was born I get that one but you can't say anything about President Obama that was sacked religious so to speak\nBut it's okay you can do anything you want to say about President Trump is okay and the press is complicit with this\nSo yeah on my side you can't say anything but on the other side you could do what you want and\nIt was very hard I got

that's what you're doing that's what's creating madman\nWell let me tell ya if I was a little over the edge what President Obama did good maybe if I was a crazy evil person may be pushed me over the edge\nHow can you compare that mark how did you say that a President Obama's just as great guy right like she never lied he never set up straw dummies like you said immigrant children it's not immigrant children and how come it's not mentioned that when people go to jail their kids are taken away from them because people don't want you to know that\nThat you don't want to have that kind of

you threaten to overwhelm the country and like I Know I've heard you know President Obama you know if you want your doctor you can keep your doctor I mean he sounds great but the fact is we got
