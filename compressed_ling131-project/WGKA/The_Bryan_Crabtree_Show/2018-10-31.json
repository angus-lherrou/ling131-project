ah\nThere's so much to tell you by friends we are living through one of the greatest law you periods of American media it in the history of the American media is drenched in why\nIt'd be ... to it and why it was swimming and why it breathes wise it exhale is why the President Trump in some way led to the murders of Pittsburgh Jews\nAs a Jew as an American as a human who loves truce these people are despicable Jew and\nNon Jews lying about this using that gets to choose because they hate Trump they hate Trump more than they love the debt that is my belief\nBecause if they didn't they wouldn't use the deaths of Jews to crap on the president\nBut that is their greatest motivating force of these people the hatred of this man is greater than obviously greater the love of truth\nTo compromise of the ... of the Anti Defamation league of various Jewish agencies of ... all of the less the entire west it's lying lying lying place\nI said my whole life the truth is not a left wing value this proceeds Donald Trump this procedure this it is merely the greatest manifestation of it we are living through another left wing lying hysteria your on diluted ally\nDemand hated Donald Trump as it happens because Donald Trump had to have was surrounded by Jews according to this man and a half of course had Jewish or relatives whose daughter among others ... this is the man who leads to anti Semitism\n\nIt is I always watch CNN because it's important to hear what the the or the other side says but it's now become emotionally impossible\nBecause it's just so filled with lies I miss that'd

about truth never did never ever ever ever did it is now its values are per per progressive its values are equality\nBut saying they were actually in ... gauge it but those are their values if truth is compromised truth is is done it's by Donald Trump led to the Pittsburgh burgers sickening use of dead Jews sickening sickening uses a\nJew when an American I Am disgusted by the left and by the ... the media the low life media\nFor their their conscience list they are conscience free because they are so filled with self righteousness in opposing Donald Trump that that's all they need to know in

Trump presidency that renders me good\nI kept ally and lie and lie and use that Jews to lie to undo this presidency\nBecause I'm doing this presidency is the Jewish thing to do it the Christian thing to do it the American thing to do and and it's of course it's the progressive thing to do that's how they justify their light\nThey lied in the beginning of the Trump presidency when they said that the calls the Jewish community centers were induced by the Trump election turned out it was a a a deranged American Jewish kid in his ... in Israel who is making Ninety percent of these bomb threat

I don't trust it but go ahead go ahead I'm not arguing with you and my only saving I ... the ... do you think that the New York times is mainstream reporting or left wing reporting\nI figured the New York times you're liberal organization\nNow okay so do you think the only liberal organization\nI think the ACL event or an uncle or one of the ... main stream of your ... as anyone could fi\nOK okay we differ on that go ahead please\nOkay so what they recorded in Trump's first year of his presidency there was a ... or ... percent increase and the second year seven percent increase and again I don't want to get caught up in a work but in anti Semitic activity to crack\nActual activity et cetera\nAnd more important relating to Trump in Pittsburgh is the right wants to limit is nothing more than an anti Semitic act however\nThere were very specific thing about these you\nBet enraged killer certainly anti Semitic 'cause that was the prime of it but you can refer like this because they favor and this is a work directly from the ... the president in theater coming up from the board [noise]\nOkay I'm a little I'm a little confused here who said who said that these Jews favored invaders\nWhere the man with the gun who killed eleven that was\nGoing okay fine okay All right fine I I Believe you I haven't heard it I Believe you you also know that he said he said he can't stand the president because the president has too many Jews around him are you aware of that you\nSaid that he said that the one thing he doesn't like about him\nBut he also through agreed with now and these are his exact words\nThat the invaders or coming to the water and he wasn't talking about Jews he was talking about migrants which was one of his favorite topic means you\nWrite in Pittsburgh have a group called ... or a big participants in a group called higher fever immigrant who provide more be over and get mainstream group in the world they started off helping Jewish refugees refuse then the other countries this gentleman\nRelax with better phrase or moment this killer\nWas enraged at ... for that reason using that\nWord President Trump right\nWhy didn't the Christians who were well All right so lumped orange let me ask why didn't he killed Jews accuse me Christians who opposed the uh the caravan and a vast numbers of immigrants coming in illegally\nWell I have great that you're working you're at work and we would certainly agree element that narrow it down there and and this certainly that was the thing that got killed ghost you okay you can write your Carter\nSo if so if the president also if the ... okay if the president were uh were said I think it's great of caravans of about tens of thousands of people come in ... she would not have killed the Jews in Pittsburgh\nI okay so obviously you're trying to say that there is the correct wander one correlation [noise] you\nKnow I'm not I'm I'm just days on what you think Leno that by ... or ... what am I trying to tell me what I'm trying to say because ... I mean I Know you may know better than I Wonder what am I trying to say\nI don't know ... why don't we get paid what Trump did ... and ... and his supporters\nWriter okay so much yes so let me ask you a question what would be how would you characterize fourteen thousand that's two ... worth of people a\nA R B you would you call them guests would you call them refugee all and they would actually be have that right ... yeah okay go on are you are oh okay okay are you for accepting them into the country\nI'm for expecting them under the appropriate or an hour or ... that go through every who wouldn't be any American Kid right\nWhat what they are not what they are not what Trump and your reporters repeatedly you've been on what you called recreate mainstream media with by looking at that time that they they're carrying electric the smallpox radically here almost ... years ago it could be forty years ago they\nBut I I think okay I under your right by the way ... ... well let me let me see okay so let me say there is there is overheated rhetoric but I Am completely opposed to letting their man\nAnd I believe that the greater threat to America frankly I think it's up to the best of my knowledge anyone who says that they're bringing of smallpox is making stupid argument okay I agree with you I never heard it but I Believe you that it's being set I'm sure a lot of ... things are being said I Am ready to ... okay\nAll right you're right fine Okay Michael I I'm agreeing with you\nYou said you don't have to debate me any more if if that is one of the stupidest arguments against is the only arguments against this is not smallpox the only argument against this is does the does America have a border or not that it can control the left essentially believes and open borders because it finds nationalism to beat the testable\nBesides at the festival in ... in the United states\nThat ... you know it and you know\nWait it's wet where nationalism is not having that nationalism is happening nationalism is having borders borders is part of the nation\nMark Martin Oregon that and you know there\nWas one is much more that's where we may differ I don't think it's more than that I don't think that\nYour your your height for protection other quarter thing that not only do we protect the border with people who want to cross that border are ... they carry your other alien\nOkay are we going back to that OK single right word I'm okay I'm a native from their credit that's now\nOkay that's a luxury we talk to you when he called animals who was MS Thirteen Thirteen our animals if you don't believe the Amish Thirteen could be characterized as animals I don't know who would be\nOkay I think the ... so the debate is about the debate is not over ... below verbiage matters I agree the debate is over whether the United states of America like any country can have a have a a a border\nI can protect its borders the way Michael protects his home in San Francisco and the way I protect my home in Los Angeles\nFor America is our home we have a right to say who can come in that's pretty elementary that's what this debate is about if the president's had only use the most congenial language and by the way I Do I have said a thousand times at least\nI Would do exactly what any of these people from Guatemala or Honduras or Mexico do I would leave the corrupt countries of Latin America and try to come to this wonderful garden of Eden\nBut it's all depicted as homophobia that's what I mean this is what I mean by by the lying media and\nUh with regards to violence yes there are individual ... there are individuals but so called right wing agenda some committed acts act of violence there there they are outliers worth despicable ... usually sick but nevertheless they are what they are\nBut with regard to the daily attacks of of screaming at people uh at shutting down ... ... let me let me give you one example which I think I've\nHuge the entire issue universities I have a picture I'm going\nTo put it up on the I'm going to put it up on\nOn our Facebook page will put it up a trigger you page will put it up but that is pretty good dot com took a picture last night of the guys do with the guys who guarded me at Colorado State university pisa these two are policemen are who are in essentially a army gone they they look like they're they're going to fight the Taliban\n\nIs any left wing speaker in the in the country meet such guards at a at a university why do only conservative speakers need armed guards at universities why would that be your face just as much violence from the writers from the left why why is that how can the most radical left wing speaker meets no guards at a university\nWhy did what Ben Shapiro went to Berkeley they spent six hundred thousand dollars for a yarmulke wearing Orthodox Jew to show up at Berkeley\nSo stuck with your lives please there's no comparison there's no comparison yes their individual despicable acts of violence by right wing or ...
