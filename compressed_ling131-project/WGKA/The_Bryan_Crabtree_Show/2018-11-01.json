a good man you should be at least as concerned with that as you are with career success\nThat's why I ask well by the way the phone number is one eighth Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six that's why I asked young women when I meet them so often a waitress or even somebody sitting next to on the airplane\nAnywhere wherever the opportunity arises I have no difficulty in fact they love speak to strangers so relevant to me so I'll say I could I ask you how old are you this is a a twenty five votes have perfect so here's my question\nAnd some of you've heard of this all ready and the question is if you could ... be guaranteed one of two things which guarantee would you take I always tell them is no right answer I'm just I Want to know how you think\nAnd I also tell them that even though one is guaranteed that doesn't mean the other camp happened it just means only one is guaranteed so if you could be guaranteed a great career or great marriage which guarantee well would you choose a that's the way I put\nSo\nThat's my question one eighth Prager seven seven six so they're really two\nOr one is what if you're a woman what message did you get and what did you follow in this regard to what do you think the message should be too young women 'cause I Know what the messages societal message is pursue\nPursue a vocation pursue a career\nAnd you know for a white man comes along well that's just great that's by the way that's often how they put it to me I'll say well the the you you're you're you're looking forward to getting married or do you you know some books that you know the right man comes along that'll be fine\nIt's not either\nThey're not telling me the whole truth and they really would like to get married or they really think that it's not that important\nAnd I think that society I look I'll tell you where I'm coming from I think you know but I'll just say it anyway I think that society has played a terrible trick or you know women and has since I was a young man this is not new with all\nThis this is part of the transformation of society that took place in the late sixties and then the seventies\nIt it was the the dream of most American girls\nWas about their wedding\nThis was mocked out of existence\nFor a young ... for a ... a high school girls to say today you know I I periodically just badge and my wedding and it's very exciting to me well aware and who will be there and who the man will be\nAnd what it will be like that ... a girl I wouldn't say that today she wouldn't say to her ...\n\nIt's been it's been so to speak it's been embarrassed out of existence\nNo ... I saw at an airport\nWould've been somebody airports the last week and a half so I don't remember which city was but different airport every day there was a big a big billboard you know they have these ads up an airport some airports\nSo there was one and it was something I Wish I took a picture of it some some better memorizing these things so showed a young woman interestingly the young woman was wearing a sort of ice\nThink I'm a Muslim type a scarf over her head\nAnd she was not white she was not black\nSo I think I think it would have been a a Middle Eastern origin attractive woman young woman with a scarf over ... but that's not critical and just describing it to you and the message was something to the effect\nYou should both read history and make history something about ...\n... I was thinking at the very well what if we put up we being Prager you what if we put up a bill I don't even tell this to anybody Prager you 'cause they would\nThink I was out of my mind but this is while I was thinking how about a one in ... in almost the same configuration of a young woman\nAnd something like something to the effect I don't have the words yet but something to the effect\nIf you find a good man\nMarry him\nSat will ultimately bring you more joy than career\n\nAnd I have no I have no problem with women in careers we we have a woman of CEO of a preview who is indispensable so [laughter]\nWell aware of the contribution\nThat a woman could make but for the most part I Would still make this by the way she would agree she's she's married and she has what three kids three kids the message\nNo I Would say yes right so the ... the truth is the reason you're not married isn't financial it's because he has an asked yet\nYeah okay [laughter] that was followed [laughter] she truly [laughter] that was sort of detective work [laughter] uh Taylor thank you for the call\nYeah that's the way it usually is people that's a very hard thing for any of us are just for me is as believe\nAs much as anyone to see reality for what it is not always\nEasy thing\nBut I've never I never understood what men call and say the same thing I've never understood this without financially ready I don't I don't quite understand that if you're not financially\nReady simply why is that different from us actually ready merrily when Meryl you'll share expenses you won't have to pay to rent\nIsn't every if you're not financially solvent isn't it isn't marriage a better financial I've you\nKnow take a\nMix to mix mixed mixed and see in Denver the famous man see of Denver Hi\nHi Dan I I'm going to get some invite a young man um I was a woman at the seventies I got my masters and we're looking to go out and be liberating to be educated and I really did enjoy the work that I did in my seven in the seventies gotten a lot and then I got married\nIn the early eighties and got the board um and we needed to go to war to support my child and I felt so um I got my job and it was intellectually stimulating and emotional and you're letting it started in the late eighties\nAnd I climbed a ladder\nAt work and I really got involved with my work I needed to do it as like that emotionally and intellectually\nI didn't focus on finding another man for myself I thought that my son and I work with my son with my ... sixty five years old in it there's no man in my life and I'm currently okay with that\nUm that my son has grown he's married he stopped doing his life\nI'm Alone and my health is not good now I had the foresight to get a long term care policy so I'm somewhere that I had people that can help take care of me\nThat I'm I'm tired I don't have a really big income because the field that I was an didn't provide me any\nUh of what I like that pension and I don't have a man and I in this world women do need ... ...\nUm I look back on decisions I made that with my decision I had many men who wanted to go out only men who all approached me and wanted to date very late but I was focused on the career than the career and the child and I made in the book in terms of my decision\nBut no I got to let you go but I ...
