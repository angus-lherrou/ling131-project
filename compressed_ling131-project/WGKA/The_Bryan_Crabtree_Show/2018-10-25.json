renders men mass killing in the eyes of women or at least that was the case for all of history and I am perfectly prepared to acknowledge that perhaps for young women today it is not the case\nI Would love to get your input on that particular issue incidentally but\nBy and large one of the most appealing traits if I may say ... ... there's a man sexy is one of the things to a woman is ambition\nKnocked crazed ambitious miss narcissism no ambition I Want to get ahead I Want to be successful and ambition\nFor all of western recorded history\nWas largely I Wish to succeed at work and I wish to provide for a wife and children I Wish to provide for a family\nFishes white male ambition this is when I was certainly when I was a kid this was what was assumed it was so so much of a given it wasn't even articulate it because it was just assumed\nWill you grow up and be able to take care of a family that was male ambition\nAnd uh my sense is that that has been a killed for many young men because it has been killed in this society\nThe notion of raising men boys to be men first of all is it believe it or not is almost considered\nArchaic today a be a man that is so sexist be a man or that is so patriarchal or some others unbelievably destructive adjective useful\nThing for a boy to aspire to be a man was a man a man takes care of the family that is the primary so the only thing that constitutes a man obviously but it is for most males that has been the defining element\nCan't well I take care in all senses of the word would like to take care of a family\nSo my assumption today is that this ambition has been shot first of all a lot of men for my generation to today even more so today oh we're taught that\nHey you don't have to take care of a family in fact you don't even have to have a family there's no real compelling reason for you to get married and if you do of the female\nWill pull her weight as they say she will row her or just as much as you will roll your or you were all a boat with two\nOr has been and so the notion that that I as a male will need to take care of a family is is considered again patriarchal an archaic do you agree that's my question do you think that the the man of ambition\nI I Wish to get ahead I Wish to succeed uh I Wish to take care of a family that this is endangered species I obviously acknowledge that they exist they existed even in significant numbers but I'm the question is proportion so if you especially\nIf you are a woman or if you have a daughter who is dating\nOr do you have a sense that this is taking place\nThat what I have described is in fact what is taking place or a this is an alarm that is not worthy of being sounded because it's not a big deal one eighth Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nThese are the numbers to talk to me if you are dating if you have a son you might have a son for example who is not particularly ambitious who was a more than happy to stay at home and uh you know make a living but not not not really aspire to more I had the sense as I told you\nHours I mentioned I didn't tell you I admit I mean it I mean lanes but it's my column this week is about\nMy wife and my experience is test driving vehicles last week at five different dealers in the Los Angeles area\nAnd my sense and they were all wonderful people are there was this news no knock on them but my sense was that\nThese were not guys who were particularly ambitious particularly passionate about their work and you could say well maybe they're not passionate about selling cars yeah but it doesn't matter you still have to be passionate about your work even if you don't care about the particulars\nBecause the the more that you were passionate about your work the more successful you'll be and the more you will rise in life\nMy father wanted to be a doctor\nYou couldn't afford medical school so became an accountant he became extremely passionate about accounting which is about is far from being a doctor is you can get but he he just decided to his great credit I'm going to become passionate about my work ... do well at it\nSo the question on the table is ... young males and ambition now overly ambitious is not good overly anything if it's good to exercise it's not good to be addicted to marathons I mean there's no end in life to the to the\nFact that any good thing can be over done so I understand you can have too much ambition\nSince then it's not ambition to take care of a family in an ambition to do good it's ambition to be to be super rich or to be super famous or to be super powerful and that's not a that is not admirable that's not what I'm Talking about\nBut the absence of ambition in men is in a mask you're leading characteristic\nThey major part of masculinity is indeed ambition I Want to succeed and wants to take care of I Want to take care of and I want to take care of\nThat's a good thing and it\nAnd and in the past it has rendered men desirable to a woman\nBut I I Believe that society has played a terrible trick on both young men and young women have told them that they are at the same was told young women that they are sexually the same as men they could enjoy any number of hookups just as much as men can we do a motion will price paid\nAnd now why do you think why do you think that this if you see a rape culture charge if colleges exists why do you think it exists it exist because so many young women have had sex that they later regretted so rather than saying you know why did I get into it they prefer to use the term break culture\nThat's that's the genesis of the a phony charges of rape culture and it's by the way this proves that it's phony the proof is the parents and their daughters to college\nNow no parent in the world would send the daughter to were raped culture I mean what are we always joking and we wonder where where are we living in the New York times\n\nAnd they told me at the same thing you know you know you know women women don't carry half their way than in any in any deal and not by the way guys you don't have to get married you know what's what's\nIn it for you divorce is a fortune anyway there's nothing in it for you you know women are available\nAnd I talk to her and I said\nAnd I don't know if you realize what it says two boys and the boys around the corner of Manhattan and your ... to ban that they are less than a than God\nRight so are we got that one of the teachers say\nOK says so I gave her the example of\nThe owner was a female teacher it was a female teacher it was that the male female to go on go on why don't you say\nSo I gave her the right I gave her the samples and things\nShe stopped for a minute and she said oh my gosh near why she said my heart than feel this way when the certain shows any changes the channel and she took that poster down on\nAnd on and you know well that is that is an exceptional teacher and part of the reason I Am convinced is it South Carolina and it is not LA New York Chicago et cetera [noise]\nThat's a powerful story I wrote it down and I think you and Michelle San Diego California tennis Prager Hi\nHi how are you at a wealth thanks\nWhere am I correct so hero ally great for taking my call when you go I think that today I really hope\nI think there is nothing more important than raising children I was a woman steady liner and hot and college that men and women are very excited when I got married and had kids and that's at children know that that's not true and uh I think that it because it\nCould it have a baby so hey stay home and take care of the baby family will go make money and money maker isn't really motivated to which is harder now to make money than it used to be
