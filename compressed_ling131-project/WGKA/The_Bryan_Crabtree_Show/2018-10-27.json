to Ken Ken you're on with mark\n[laughter] um yes I voted for President Trump simply because you said he was going to drain the swamp it didn't mean if you were a Democrat or Republican you were bad it was ... and you're you're out and make America great again\nAnd it didn't matter what side you're on but if you were bad and all these people that are against him\nAre wondering like little dogs which are dealing with three or like\nThat man I think the Democrats overplay their hand let's go to Joe in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania you're on was mark\nHey mark I just don't understand I Can't get this through my head why Hillary Clinton isn't being held accountable when she opened recalled for civil unrest last week um\nUntil the Democrats are back in power when you do that and you have a national or international audience don't wackos or want to come out of the woodwork and she should be held accountable for making that statement\nYeah but Joe she's on the other side chicken say anything she wants [laughter]\nRight [laughter] I\nYou know what it it made the other day as far as that ... concern out how to eliminate all media coverage or say hey we're going to let them in but they have to register Republican and\nThey have to learn about [laughter] you not hear anything about the cabin anymore yeah you're\nThat's a great point in fact a you know I I agree with you if there was any thought\nThat illegal immigrants who are voting for Republicans in huge numbers certainly even in a majority why do I have a strong feeling that the Democrats would be against illegal immigration like they were four years right there are a lot of clips from buying into um Clinton uh\nTo Hillary Clinton all of them were against illegal immigration but now that it's convenient and they need the vote by the way\nIf they lose a minority votes in the proportions that Trump seems capable of doing the words they Democrats are always get what Ninety Ninety five percent of voting Obama's case\nIf it ever starts to go the other way they are in huge trouble because that's what they count on that count as I mentioned the store with ... that they cannot just wrote here's what we do we vote for the Democrats they care about the poor the fact that they haven't helped to pour the fact that\nIf you looked at the school system I teach part time and see what it's like in the inner cities none of that seems to matter their immune to that\nBecause what they have on their side they have to press they have the media they have the schools certainly have the colleges they have so many things going for them\nThat it's no wonder that the Democrats get so many votes from minorities because they don't know\nThey don't know that a lot of the stuff they've been hearing and listening to all these years has done them no good\nThey told over and over again Republicans are evil they hate you there for big business yeah we didn't even get the big business well last time most of the rich people in this country voted for Obama and certainly it wasn't a Trump fault and for Hillary Clinton\nSo this idea that Republicans were for of our big business and the Democrats and the poor and the people who and we had a caller challenge me on that are for the poor and and the disenfranchised each not true\nAnd that's what President Trump appeals to so many people because one of the things that gets them in trouble like everything in life there's a balance theory also helps and they know he says what he's thinking there is none of this being and all the stuff the politicians usually do\nWhat'd you say one thing and then live another way to do with a different way\nThis guy is different he surprised me he said some things on Twitter in do you know to eat some things you wish you wouldn't\nBut the American people are thrilled that they finally got a president that standing up for the United states of America finally got a president that understands that free enterprise is the thing that builds everybody\nThat this is what makes America special it was an exceptional experiment in the course of human history and Paul Donald Trump in his own way gets that let me know what

I I Wish every left wing or the country could have seen what what how we talk\nJust amongst ourselves and the civility of it and the lack of be treated it would be fascinating to contrast that with a similar evening of people on the left to an audience on the left but\nI don't know how I Would do it but I Would like to talk to about a little moral leader 'cause I Want to talk a little bit about the last question was asked but in the meantime they have found a suspect\n\nOr they have arrested a suspect me in these uh\nI don't even know what to call them with the real bombs whatever they were sent to all these people on the left avid so far it looks like it looks like a man is a a\nA coup on the right\nAnd ah he has a they have his van dam is\nPlastered with Donald Trump stickers and the like so we will ah let's see we have even more information just coming in mail use in his fifties\nAnd let's see what else we can say a rush made in connection with male explosive devices white van outside plantation auto zone appears to be focused\nSilver investigators and if you get the pictures of it uh\nYou conceive of the the pro Donald Trump\nStickers and people look if it's conceivable the guys on the left wants to make believe use all the right but I I suspect that this is the real deal he's simply a he was already it's interesting he's already been arrested in the past is a record for making terror threats\nWhy people who make terrorists threats are not in jail is one of my ... but I don't understand why they have to actually acted out\nYou can't threaten death terror and the like and that would be sufficient to place you improve I I don't know I've a question that imposing\nSo on is going to happen and it's already happening you see we told you it's the Trump rhetoric that caused the Trump rhetoric that caused the truck prior to Donald Trump to the left and the right got along great the left was not calling a ... all of us all of us all of us racists\nAnd all I I'm not ... there were not calling up police a racist\nAnd even on occasion pigs this none of this was happening guy who pay portrays the ... polices pigs on his socks in a in a a football game in a is a chosen by Nike to be spokesman ... this is all this as well because of Trump's presumably\nA wedding that Charles Murray uh one of the most thoughtful of people in the country or he goes to speak of

disappeared from the news that when you get updates on Steve ... is going to be used as a condition and that would be it\n\nBut now this thing a ripe ripe it before the elections I mean this guy aside from just being ... evil in his ...\nAm sick is stupid stupid and be if if\nIf the left could have invented the guy they would have invented the guy if he turns out to be the right wing or is added that apparently he he is I say apparently\nBecause of the of the ban but as soon as I heard ... and then in ... in the beginning I thought this could this could well be a guy on the left because it's so often these hoaxes to take place but\nThat is more information came in and I thought about it more in real life to the targets worked hard for me to imagine these these were the ideal targets of somebody who does have people on the left I don't know if the people on the left would have picked the same targets if they were trying to blame the right\nWe'll find out more and I will let you know any more information as it is revealed to the public of the United states of America so I have a very interesting thing for you here very\nInteresting today uh let's see David Brooks in the New York times who ... the New York times has three\nColumnist author of about twenty that are not on the left\nAnd David Brooks is one of them I've never known that are on the right there are not less ... which is fine but they're they're not really on the right eye number words I don't\nI don't believe I Know for a fact there was not a single pro Trump columnist or twenty twenty five Columbus of the New York times not one\nHalf the country is pro Trump and not a single Columbus they could not find the human being\nScored I take that back reports they could find the human being they would not publish a human being who was pro Trump on the opinion page\nThe um the New York times of the New York times so but David Brooks is not a is not on the left he was just ... I Would say just centrist is quite anti Trump\nBut he wrote a piece in which he spoke about how beautiful nationalism is that he is a nationalist he's not a global list\nWhich in the New York times that gutsy thing to do of course he spoke about how Donald Trump\nOr is not a good nationalist either 'cause otherwise you would be unacceptable to the New York Times' readership defeated also attack\nDonald Trump I'm not saying about sincere that I'm fairly telling you to pets what happened but the article the column was a pro nationalism pieces I remember I spent some time on that is very important to president said he's a nationalist any attack the global lists\nAnd he was laughed at CNN andme I played the laughter I mean they actually laughed at it\nSo now I what I find even more interesting than the columns\nOr the comments by readers so I Want to read you some of the comments of New York times readers to New York times column\n... the virtues of nationalism\nIn which he says I Love my nation you know and it's a good thing to love your nation and ... you know I I feel more for my nation than I Do for another nation just like feel more for my family and the number of family\n\nAnd I want other nations to love their nation right all of which I have said very often myself so listen to some of the uh some of the letters that are written and again I'll give you updates are with regard to uh anything in Florida here with the suspect of the bombing\nSo here's number one ... the\nTimes picks a half times picks there were three uh\nThree a list that's the word three lists of comments the New York times pick list the readers pick list\nAnd all\nSo this is the times pick that sounds like patriotism to me and there's a difference nationalism is historically been used to know the superiority of the nation to the detriment of other nations in the world community nationalism as arrogance and false pride\nSo I Am about this this has nothing to do with the bobber I Want to ask a question about Megan Kelly so I keep reading how she's a racist and she's a racist and she's a racist she may be raised I I I don't know her I I don't particularly care for her but I Do have a great care for troops\nSo the ah one of the big example biggest constant examples is that she said that Santa Claus is white\n\nNow let me say for the record that I Love seeing black Santa clauses and Asian Santa Claus is I Love it I think it I think that is truly the spirit of Christmas\nTo see a the idea of that Santa Claus can only be white that would be that would be racist I think\nBut eve Santa Claus the ... the legend of Santa Claus coming from Europe\nAnd coming and and the you know for kids another disease from the north pole the people in the north well I guess really north I guess you might be a more of a nobody think of it am Eskimo\nBut anyway it's an ... it's an audit charge that if if if you hang your hat on she said Santa Claus is white\nUh\n[laughter] it doesn't strike me that that is evidence that the person thinks that blacks should be mistreated\nOr is it they are inherently inferior in some way I but tell me I'm very I really am curious 'cause I I'm not I'm not up on my triggers here\nThat that's an interesting thing just to me by Sean so this is joy bay are dressed as a a beautiful\nAfrican woman for Halloween this is from twenty sixteen\nBut look I I don't know the the rules are very complex I got to tell you as you know\nThe University of California has a big list of micro aggressions things that you can things you can say is that reveal that you're a racist I mean you are racist if you say you you don't you the only race you think exist as the human race that actually\nActually matter one or the ...

theory M you've probably heard\nMe say ... thousand or so times 'cause I have a lot of\nTheories about life ... theory that identities are important to happiness\n\nWith me and I'm thinking of three and there may be more and if you have more or if you defer certainly if you defer one aide Prager seven seven six but first hear what the identities are\nAnd they are and know a new order from Port stress three identities that I think are\nThey are necessary or they are major additives to one's happiness but they are not sufficient if this is this a loan doesn't make you happy but they are great\nAdditives supplements contribute towards that is the word they're great contribute tours to one's happiness or sexual identity male or female a national identity and a religious identity\n[noise] I think in my lifetime I have seen that these things are real contributors now the reason I warn you at the outset the trigger is that there are those and I won't even identify them 'cause it's a happy this hour on everybody to listen and everybody to be as comfortable as possible\nBut there are those who are working to\nIdentify those identities and say that they they really are not real and they are not even good\nBut that and therefore I truly truly believe they are contributing to unhappiness in the population\nBy knocking these identities won a prank or Seventy seven six so that I Believe that the more comfortable you are with being a woman or being a man being a boy or being a girl\nAnd that is that is a serious part of your identity sir I Will be totally over by a graphic here I have always been very lucky I admit it always been comfortable with being mail\nI've never wanted to be a female I've never thought of myself as female I Am truly comfortable and I I celebrate ... to ... to whatever extent that celebrate a ball I Am I my male identity and I want females to do the exact same thing with being female\nI think I mean I I don't know how you can debate that that is a contributor to happiness nobody would argue even the most I Would think\nOf the most ardent defender of the transgendered and I'm not even attacking the trenches it on the contrary is not an attack at all but I I Would say that nobody would argue that having gender this for you thinking that you are the other sex\nThen your biological given sex is not an it's not a source of happiness it may be something that you you you have to deal with and of course it's something you have to deal with\nAnd you should try to filter maximize your opportunities for happiness in life but it's you gotta really deny reality to argue that that is\nA a not an obstacle at the very least to one's happiness we're one is not comfortable being a male or being a female\nSo that's one identity\nI identities in fact almost been given a bad Maine\nOh here's an identity ooh that's not that's not good next is a national identity I think it contributes to one's happiness to feel part of something larger\nAnd it and I think uh I think it's terrific I feel very American it has been a major contribution contributor to my happiness and I uh I celebrate it\nDoesn't mean I think America can do no wrong with some sort of absurdity it's like saying I don't think men can do any wrong celebrating the fact that I Am a man\nOr or comfortable with the fact that I'm a man but having an identity more the more I identify as this is my thesis of this happiness our the more you identify with\nThe the greater your chance for happiness and third as a religious identity that is played a major role in my life in my case Judaism being Jewish\nAnd it is for Christians obviously the majority great majority of you listening obviously you're not Jewish but it doesn't matter or whatever it might be if you're more men if you're if you're Catholic if your Protestant if you're evangelical\nOr whatever it might be what every ... if it can contribute to your happiness sometimes it contributes to misery all of them can all of them can also contribute to your misery\n... nothing is a guarantee in life\nYou can be a you can be at war with your with your religious identity some people are\n\nWhen I first started radio I was the moderator of a program on ABC in Los Angeles very very very popular show I inherited a very popular show ...\nI was the moderator there's a priest a rabbi minister each week different ones each week and then they were members of fourth religions\nAnd I would get calls people would call it and I remember how many people called it and it was amazing to me so much so that one time there were so many people who identify themselves as hey Hi Venice so I just want to say to the priest I'm an ex Catholic or I'm a recovering Catholic and I I\nI I was amazed I was amazed at how many people still identify themselves that nobody called the say you know I'm an ex Protestant I'm an ex Jew [laughter] so ... we had this this I these people were obviously at war with their identity one guy called that he was Ninety\nAnd he was still angry at the nuns who would do is apparently wrapped his knuckles with a ruler when he was when he was twelve I told\nThem you know I Am and I'm not Catholic but it seems to me after Seventy eight years you might want to give that up\nAnyway I I Know that in my life those three identities religious national and sexual have been major contributors [noise] and I know that there is a sort of a war against those identities today and I think all that will do is decrease human happiness\nHow many of them out of your children feel\nWell I have a one boy and he's actually the thing and they found out and he's he's good [laughter] he he's also\n... who do you have who do you have these conflicts with\nA more of a trend more like friends in foreign like find your extended family\nLook I I hear you I don't want to talk too much politics on the happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality or what but she says is true\nSusan wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it I mean while there are many ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find kindred spirits over was you'd be a very low\nWhen he can be\nBut if it's a challenge to find kindred spirits to that in New York City isn't that interesting I of course I don't know Susan but as soon as she said she celebrates being a woman being an American and being a Jew I just assumed they knew her politics\nBut interesting\nIt's a very interesting defining element in the ideological rift in America thank you Susan I appreciate that uh in in Chicago hello and Dennis Prager\n... thank you so much for taking my call long time listener\nI Am driving with my son who is Eighteen years old who is away at college and it's\nDriving in the car in the boat to your TV shows and radio shows on your ah your ... to ... university and with regard to identity his name is ... and you want to talk a little bit about his identity issues that he's in college in California\nYeah that pretty much I I I grew up in uh LA cargo and then I uh I just moved to California I don't know\nHow they're pretty much when I'm In the classroom like I talk about whatever led by a ... like like like questions like that like\nIf I if I buy on like I get back what like\nWhat is the best way to do yet I'm In my area by a lot of like it

you\nLook this is again this transcends specifically the happiness issue but my general approach is to clarify where we differ it comes across as extremely non aggressive totally non defensive\nBoth so you're not defending you and you're not in attacking them just say listen we're you know we're both here to study and we're both students and you know we're good guy and so on and so what I like to do just what I like to do is I like to figure out where it is I I might differ with somebody\nSo then you just you you can I ask a if a few questions or\nAnd one of them might be you know I

that you do\nI'm I'm thirty six years old on married um I struggle with bipolar disorder and mental illness and addiction but I tell you what one of the greatest identities that has grounded me the reality is it's family well especially my wife I mean she came to my life than as and\nExistential battle for the soul of this country we need to vote\nWe need to take action this is it's not okay that people are having to defend themselves against this kind of violence this this should have been thrown out I mean nobody should have to take this seriously but right now jak Philips and others have to take this seriously and the lights defending freedom has to defend them I'm Matt this is a really crazy cases it not\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with when the civil rights commission\nThat had just lost at the Supreme Court mused jacks\nCase against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case to find probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this commission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his\nBeliefs this isn't about letting him continue to operate as business and serve every body but give him the freedom to decline certain cakes this is saying\nWe hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that uh your average American really would rather ignore this kind of stuff that I'm telling you folks ah one we're fighting a civil war when we were finding the revolution there always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight\nA and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is a battle for everybody this is not us against them God Forbid or the people on the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior toward their fellow Americans is it's just not right and but we have to stand up so the least we can do I as I said his vote a please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't uh\nDon't as so many people have such excuses please or if you don't vote don't ever complain again a and I want to say uh if you can give to the alliance defending freedom I don't know anybody that is doing this kind\nWork right now so I Want to say go to Texas talked dot com you'll see the banner every penny you give will be doubled up please give what you can visit folks this is why God gives us money\nAn energy is is to use them for his purposes and right now I'm this is something that's about all we need to fight it it's tremendous because they will come for you eventually you know of everybody just looks the other way uh eventually\nThey're going to come for you and you're going to ask you to do something that violates your values you can say or where do I turn well uh I like to think you could turn to\nIt's offending freedom so the number in case you don't have a\nA website you can go to my taxes talk dot com it that's difficult or you can call one eight hundred\nFive five six twenty seven Seventy one eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy one eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy a mat sharp uh what else are we looking at what other cases are out there right now because this seems to be never ending\nThat's right I think one of the other big issues we've been working on dealing with a adoption and foster care providers\nSo we have a a crisis in our country with a four hundred thousand kids in the adoption foster care system about a hundred thousand kids\nAre eligible for adoption and we need organizations out there recruiting families trained them\nHelping to connect kids with forever homes but the same uh effort to\nPunish faith based organizations just to the same hostility we solve towards the jak we're now seeing towards these agencies and so in Philadelphia in Massachusetts in Illinois and other places faith based agencies have been shut down run out of business simply because they want to operate consistent with their view about the best environment\nTo raise a kid that every child deserves a mother and father and so at the same time for example in Philadelphia that the city was saying we desperately need more foster care parents are just a few days later they were shutting down by Catholic social services because\nThey didn't like Catholic social services views about marriage and this again shows this ongoing hostility and the impact it's having on kids that they're being denied of organizations out there working to find them homes they're being denied of these families that\nWould have been recruited all because this effort to push an ideology and for the government to punish those that don't like that they don't like their beliefs\nI have to say if this doesn't make you mad folks if this doesn't make you mad I I just assume\nYou're not listening because this is horrendous and the only good news and that's why I'm here folks I'm not here to complain\nIs to say you can do something about it one of the things you can do and I hope you will do is give to the alliance defending freedom it doesn't matter what you give give something we've got to help them do what they do or you can go to the

Morsi of the local station and the ... say I'm told baby the Patriot one of my favorite and Larry Elder and Michael ... there was really ah\nI I Wish there was an evening that I I I Wish every left wing or in the country could have seen how what what how we talk\nJust amongst ourselves and the civility of it and the lack of be treated it would be fascinating to contrast that with a similar evening of people on the left to an audience on the left but\nI don't know how I Would do it but I Would like to talk to about a little moral leader 'cause I Want to talk a little bit about the last question was asked but in the meantime they have found a suspect\nOr they have arrested a suspect in me and they use a I don't even know what to call them with the real bombs whatever they were sent to all these people on the left avid so far it looks like it looks like a man is a a\nA ... on the right\nAnd he has a a they have his vantage band is\nPlastered with Donald Trump stickers and the like so we will ah let's see we have even more information just coming in now he's in his fifties\nAnd let's see what else we can say a rush made in connection with male explosive devices white van outside plantation auto zone appears to be focused even vest the gators\nAnd if you get the pictures of it or\nYou can see the the the pro Donald Trump\nStickers and giving people look it's conceivable the guys on the left or you want to make believe use all the right but I I suspect that this is the real deal he's simply a he was already it's interesting he had already been arrested in the past is a record for making terror threats\nWhy people who make terror threats are not in jail is want to buy a boat rentals I don't understand why they have to actually acted out\nYou can't threaten death terror and the like and that would be sufficient to place you\nAre in prison I I don't know I'm I'm just a question that by posing\nSomeone is going to happen and it's already happening is you see we told you it's a Trump rhetoric that caused the Trump rhetoric that caused the truck prior to Donald Trump to the left and the right got along great the left was not calling a ... or all of us all of us all of us racists\nAnd all I I'm not ... they were not calling up police a racist\nAnd even on occasion pigs this none of this was happening guy who pay portrays the police's pigs on his socks in a in a a football game and a is a chosen by Nike to be at spokesman ... this is all this is all because of Trump's presumably\nUh when I met Charles Murray uh one of the most votes for people in the country or he goes to speak at Middlebury College and or is it physically attacked in ... and a woman ... professor with him is injured out by a left wing students now that's all Trump\nShe ... this is the amazing thing\nOnly only the rights views hate is is the lie the one of the grand lies I should make a list they have to do that for myself the grandest of the laws\nThe greatest of the lodges that America is racist the or the other number one is that we ... I don't know word Nazis right I mean come on\n... and ... you remember how fast the steam Scalia and the the shooting at at the Republican congressmen playing a baseball game mouth fast that disappeared from the news I mean you get updates on Steve's squeezes a condition and that would be it\n\nBut now this thing uh right right it's before the elections I mean this guy aside from just being ... evil\nIn his ... in sick is stupid stupid envy if if\nIf the what could have invented the guy they would have invented the guy if he turns out to be the right wing or is that it that apparently he he is I say apparently because of the of the van but as soon as I heard ... and then in ... in the beginning I thought this could this could well be a guy on the left\nBecause it's so often these hoaxes do take place but that's more information came in and my phone about more than I realized who the targets where it's hard for me to imagine these these were the ideal targets or somebody who does have people on the left on and off the people on the left would have picked the same targets if they were trying to blame the right\nWill find out more than I Will let you know any more information as it is revealed to the public of the United states of America so I have a very interesting thing for you here very interesting\nToday uh let's see David Brooks in the New York times who ... the New York times has three columnist author of about twenty that are knocked on the left\nAnd David Brooks is one of them\nI there were none that are on the right there are not less ... which is fine but they're they're not really\nOn the right eye number words I don't I don't believe I Know for a fact there was not a single pro Trump Columbus the twenty twenty five Columbus of the New York times not walk\nHalf the country is pro Trump and not a single columnist they could not find a human being\nThe ... I take that back of course they could find a human being they would not publish a human being who was pro Trump on the opinion page\nOf the New York times of the New York times so but David Brooks is not is not over what you just do a couple of Jesus centrist is quite anti Trump\nBut he wrote a piece in which she spoke about how beautiful nationalism is that he is a nationalist he's not a global is\nWhich in the New York times the gutsy thing to do of course he spoke about how Donald Trump\nIs probably a good nationalist either because of all why she would be kind of acceptable to the New York Times' readership defeated also attack\nDonald Trump I'm not saying you've got some serious unfairly telling you that that's what happened but the article the column was a pro nationalism pieces remember I spent some time on that it's very important to president ... any attack the global lists and he was last data CNN on my plate glass\nThere I mean they actually laughed at it\nSo now I what I find even more interesting than the columns or the comments by readers so I Want to retain some of the comments of New York times readers to New York times\nColumn ... the virtues of nationalism in which he says I Love my nation you know and it's a good thing to love your nation and my you know I I feel more for my nation than I Do for another nation just like feel more for my family been another family\n\nAnd I want other nations to love their nation right all of which I have said very often myself so listen to some of the ah some of the letters that are written and we get I'll give you updates are with regard to uh anything in Florida here with the suspect of the bombing\nSo here number one ... this is the time she picks may have times picks there were three uh\nThree a list that's the word three lists of comments that New York times pick list the readers picked list and all so this ... times pick\nThat sounds like patriotism to me and there's a difference nationalism is historically been used to to know the superiority of the nation to the detriment of other nations in the world community nationalism as arrogance and falls pride\nNationalism can blind citizen to the need for critical thinking and it says he wants country's policy\nSo you see this is this is a big issue this is really really big [noise]\nSo I Am about this this has nothing to do with the bomber I Want to ask a question about Megan Kelly so I keep reading how she's a racist and she's a racist and she's a racist she may be right either I don't know her I I don't particularly care for her but I Do have a great care for troops\nSo the ah one of the big examples biggest constant examples is that she said that Santa Claus is white\nNow\nLet me say for the record that I Love seeing black Santa clauses and Asian Santa Claus is I Love it I think it's I think that is truly the spirit of Christmas\nTo see a the idea of at\nSanta Claus can only be wiped out would be that would be racist I think [noise] but is Santa Claus the ... the legend of Santa Claus coming from Europe\nAnd coming and and the you know for kids another disease from the north pole the people of north well I guess really north I guess you might be a more of a nobody think of it am Eskimo\nBut anyway it's an it's an odd charge that if if if you hang your hat on she said Santa Claus is white\nUh\n[laughter] it doesn't strike me that that is evidence that the person thinks that blacks should be mistreated\nOr is it they are inherently inferior in some way I but tell me I'm very I really am curious 'cause I I'm not I'm not up on my triggers here\nThat that's an interesting thing just to me by Sean so this is joy bay are dressed as a beautiful\nAfrican woman for Halloween this is from twenty sixteen but\nI I don't know the rules are very complex I got to tell you as you know the University of California has a big list of micro aggressions things that you could things you can say\nThat reveal that you're a

correct we should put that picture up actually I spoke to penguins in the Antarctic um\nThe two subjects happiness and ethical monotheism\nAnd they ah they were equally interested in both there was one paying when the hundred or so looking at me the others most of the others had their nose under the butt of their partner\nWhat a strange why does that make me strange because the beak [noise]\nHave noses okay they beaks ... penguins have beaks and I guess you write about their ... their birds they're ... birds I guess why every body and this is the happiness our today's subject\nI admit at the outset so here is a trigger warning we need you know what we need a musical or some sound effect [noise]\n\nThere's not a dog whistle it's a trigger no there's not a dog was all this is a trigger for the sensitive\nSo but they will know that they may be challenged or even a God Forbid really God Forbid offended\nThat knows that works\nSo here it is everybody and knowing\nThe what made me think of this topic was actually the last hour the previous hour talking about nationalism so I have a theory and you've probably heard me say that no\nOne thousand or so\nTimes 'cause I have a lot of theories about life ... theory that identities are important to happiness\n\nWith me and I'm thinking of three and there may be more and if you have more or if you defer certainly if you defer one aide Prager seven seven six but first hear what the identities are\nAnd they are in no uh in order reports just three identities that I think are\nThey are necessary or they are major additives to one's happiness but they are not sufficient if this is this a low doesn't make you happy but they are great\nAdditives supplements contribute towards that is the word they're great contribute towards towards happiness or sexual identity male or female a national identity and the religious identity\nI think in my lifetime I have seen that these things are real contributors\nNow the reason I warn you at the outset the trigger is that there are those am I won't even identify them 'cause it's a happiness our want everybody to listen and everybody to be as comfortable as possible but there are those who are working to\nIdentify those identities and say that they they really are not real and they are not even good\nBook that and therefore I truly truly believe they are contributing to unhappiness in the population\nBy knocking these identities\nWon a Prager seven seven six so that I Believe that the more comfortable you are with being a woman or being a man being a boy or being a girl\nAnd that is that is a serious part of your identity sir I Will be totally all by a graphic here I have always been very lucky I admit it always been comfortable with being mail\nI've never wants to be a female I've never thought of myself as female I Am truly comfortable and ah I celebrate ... to ... to whatever extent that his celebrate a ball I Am I my male identity and I want females to do the exact same thing with being female\nI think I mean I I don't know how you can debate that that is a contributor to happiness nobody would argue even the most I Would think\nOf the most ardent defender of the transgender and I'm not even attacking the trench is on the contrary he was not an attack at all but I I Would say that nobody would argue that having gender this for you thinking that you are the other sex\nOr bend your biological given sex is not an it's not a source of happiness it may be something that you you you have to deal with and of course it's something you have to deal with\nAnd you should try to filter maximize your opportunities for happiness in life but\nIf you've got a really did my reality to argue that that is a a not an obstacle at the very least to one's happiness where one is not comfortable being a male or being a female\nSo that's one identity I identity is in fact almost been given a bad name\nOh he has an identity ooh that's not that's not good next is a national identity I think it contributes to one's happiness to feel part of something larger\nAnd ... and I think uh I think it's terrific I feel very American it has been a major contribution contributor to my happiness and I uh I celebrate it\nDoesn't mean I think America can do no wrong with some sort of serenity it's like saying I don't think men can do any wrong celebrating the fact that I'm a man or or comfortable with the fact that I'm a man but having an identity more the more\nI identify as this is my thesis of this happiness our the more you identify with the the greater your chance for happiness and third is a religious identity that is played a major role in my life in my case Judaism being Jewish\nAnd it is for Christians obviously the majority great majority that you're listening obviously you're not Jewish but it doesn't matter or whatever it might be if you're a Mormon if you're if you're Catholic if you were Protestant if you're evangelical\nOr whatever it might be what every it it could it can contribute to your happiness sometimes it contributes to misery all of them can all of them can also contribute to your misery\n... nothing is a guarantee of life you can be a you\nCan be at war with your with your religious identity some people are\n\nWhen I first started radio I was the moderator of a program on ABC in Los Angeles very very very popular show I inherited a very popular show ...\n\nI was the moderator and there's a priest a rabbi minister each week different ones each week and then there were members of force religions\nAnd I\nWould get calls people would call him and I remember how many people called and it was amazing to me so much so that one time there were so many people who identify themselves as hey how's it going to say I just want to say that the priest almost ... Catholic or I'm a recovering Catholic and I I\nI I was amazed I was amazed at how many people still identify themselves that nobody called up to say you know I'm an ex Protestant I'm an ex Jew [laughter]\nSo ... we had this this I these people were obviously at war with their identity one guy called that he was Ninety\nAnd he was still angry at the nuns would do is apparently raptors ... through the roof or when he was when he was twelve I told them you know I Am and\nI'm not Catholic but it seems to me after Seventy eight years you might want to give that up [noise]\nAnyway I I Know that in my life those three identities religious national and sexual have been major contributors [noise] semi mills if there is a sort of a war against those identities today and I think all that will do is decrease human happiness\nAn I Try to I think that face it you know try to keep shuttling bike and also with my friends peace in the household peace in the world but it's becoming increasingly difficult because\nI think they can move toward feeling slightly isolated especially in the demographic where I live I live in New York I'm living in New York santhara then and there you have it so I feel what I feel badly about the environment\nHow many of them out of your children feel well\nI have a one boy and he's actually the thing and then found out and he's he's good [laughter] he he's also\n... who do you have who do you have these conflicts with\nA more of a trend more like friends and family find you um extended family\nWell look uh I I hear you I don't want to talk too much politics happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality or what\nWhat she says is true Susan wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it I mean while there are many ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find kindred spirits over was you'd be very lonely it would be\nBut if it's a challenge to find kindred spirits to that in New York City isn't that interesting I of course I don't know Susan but as soon as she said she celebrates being a woman being an American and being a Jew I just assumed they knew her politics\nBut interesting\nIt's a very interesting defining element in the ideological rift in America thank you Susan I appreciate that uh ed in Chicago hello and Dennis Prager\n... thank you so much for taking my call a long time

son listening to the show in the car I have a very sweet image of of the two of you thank you\nLook this is again this transcends specifically the happiness issue but my general approach is to clarify

study and we're both students and you know we're good guys and so on I'm so what I like to do just what I like to do is I like to figure out where it is I I might differ with somebody so then you just
