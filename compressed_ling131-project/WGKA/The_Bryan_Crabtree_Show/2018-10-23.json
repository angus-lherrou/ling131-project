be so what is it now seven thousand or have you seen pictures of the caravan coming in from largely from Honduras\n\nLike to talk to somebody about how the how did they get through the Mexican border Mexicans just don't care\nI keep remain conflicting reports of it's not clear to me they only let six hundred forty and then there are seven thousand so it was a six hundred forty years at seven thousand\nAnd it's it looks like seven thousand to me it's a mile long and again the question is how how did they just have such a large group trip through Mexico about that I think Mexico chairs a\nSubstantial part of their population lives in the United states and phones Mexico they send back billions of dollars\nWe take the unemployed off Mexico's hands I mean we're essentially were a ... government of Mexico me and my state\nAnd the left thinks that it's a terrific thing even though all of those is in ... the Mexicans to avoid confronting their own issues\nIf every country could send all those who are not employed or all those who are unhappy to another country why should you deal with any of your problems but hey that's you know\nThat that pales that question pales in significance compared to the possibility of more Democrats\nBecause if you can't make enough Democrats in your own population you need to import Democrats so that you can win more elections so that's what they do the import Democrats\nThat an amazing thing done anywhere else in the world and the democracy we import millions of people in order to have you will look good that's what it's about\n\nAnd it's a it's a big question we should have some folks um because it's a big question here how are they going to be stopped see this is me my fear is that\nThey will obviously they will have to be physical stoppage of people but ... come to the border they'll say please turn around okay we'll go ... miles or Seventeen hundred miles out of I don't know what the distances back to Honduras\nBy the way I just want to add I feel for every one of these people like totally feel for them\nTo live in Latin America is largely to live in a corrupt society\nSeats are fascinating thing we're supposed to we're supposed to acknowledge that they should come into the United states because things are so terrible for them but if you say why things are so terrible for them then the left

there's no difference between American culture Latin American culture no none whatsoever American culture was not superior and the moral weight to Latin American culture\nBut everybody wants to fleet
