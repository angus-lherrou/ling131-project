this weekend Sunday ten fourteen you know were taping this to bring all these wonderful people to you that we could never ever ever get in one room except the gun rights policy conference so\nWe're kind of back to back there but we've got a whole different crop in for a whole different reason actually believe it or not so let's get going here on segment for from the cross breed holster studios to knock out this hour of armed American radios monster broadcast from Phoenix sitting to my left the only individual\nWho I've named the segment after over all these years you know him as the Allen Corwin experience it as a pleasure and an honor to be here with how are you good to actually see your face mark what a pleasure almost no it's a pleasure it's okay to have that too and that's okay I found a rock out in front of my hotel last night\nAnd I know there's a lot of rocks in Arizona and it looked like a lever right you know what you do with a lever I yes as a matter of fact I Do but tell me you throw it over your shoulder and you'll leave or right here 'cause it's worthless yeah that's right I'm a rock collect on when he's ... years ago and I know\nI Know that was but as a geologist here in a very highly miner allies state\nWe go rock collecting with kids and we teach them about nature and they learned about geology and the planet and it's really wonderful and some of the rocks you find or leave or right leave or right there we went around and others are very valuable for a collection teach you a lot about science geology chemistry physics things you don't get in school\nAnd the fun part is you teach kids\nThere's lots of other things you can teach kids about two and we just had a a a veteran a mark Boston was on from Vietnam better which wonderful ...\nWho's out there trying to teach kids in high school about some of the things that you and I worked together on for many many years that's right now you're going to talk today and I love listening to you speak as you're you're a huge hit ear your band plays here this is a wonderful meeting and I'm proud to say\nThis time when I speak to switch third time I'm not a life member of a ... graduate oh it's really fun to be here this is family to me and you know how much I Love coming here\nNow I Know and this is the sixth year in a row the guns enamel magazine named Arizona as the number one little white\nFor gun ownership and gun used where constitutional carry a term that came from Arizona and all sorts of laws to protect your rights like nowhere else just a pleasure or a gun here is like a book\nWritten by it and sell it among your friends you can carry it without much concern there is some prohibited places but they make sense give or take\nWell you know but there's crime that comes with that Allen and I'm surprised that Arizona right is their crime that\nCome into the no more no more than anywhere else you have criminals they operate in their criminal ... some ... and then there's the rest of us and\nWe found out who she will carry Arizona would still be the quote unquote wild west of course I'm being sarcastic\nNo but criminals operate on the constitutional carry anyway says simply carry guns and it's illegal and sometimes it gets stop sometimes they don't they used to be an honest person carried a gun and got stopped oh my God this is bad and it ruins your life but it's just possession of personal property and you bring up a very important point\nOne of the laws were going to start going for a nationwide\nIs discrimination against civil rights based on firearms the banks are trying to close down companies try to deal with firearms that's discrimination it's discrimination based on the civil rights he can't do that\nAnd the hotels to any argument is well the hotels are private place so we can do that you can't see this is private I don't Lenin blacks I I don't let engaged fat people women Jews that civil rights and civil rights are and in the constitution if you've noticed\nBut firearms is right there it's an explicit express right\nAnd banning it is illegal and this is a civil rights battles that we have to start operating on that way\nAnd something tells me that you personally are going to be at the tip of the spear that fight here in Arizona\nI'm drafting the bill on with the infringement law infringement is banned if you try and take a firearm from somebody who legally owns it that's infringement by definition the people who do it should be held accountable and your firearm should be immune from confiscation now\nAre we going to get something like this is Alan Gottlieb behind the previous segment we're talking about Arizona being ground zero and it is on two fronts All right\nIn the Senate of course wrestling for control the Senate I never would have thought we'd see red Arizona wrestling for control the Senate wants the state Senate or the federal federal ... okay this is a big fight as we know McCain has passed away flake is out of here big fight going on right now the polls are showing this neck and neck give or take one percentage point a Democrat could win here\nAnd I can't imagine a Democrat from Arizona voting against anything pro gun doesn't known him for anything growing for anything or anti God ... that doesn't seem to make sense in the\nFrom the blood of the state um Atlanta's at Arizona is going through some change Californians are abandoning that state because of the California policies and they're coming to Arizona where the property is better and the rights are better taxes are lower almost everything is better here except for the beach front we have a lot of beach no water\nAnd so they come here can't see it\nYeah it's all the way it will only over there right and right after the earthquake will have about a beach front I'm ... so they come here and they bring their California ways and it is affecting the voting body and it has the potential to change the legislature\nBut Arizona is about as hard core pro America as there is in America\nTold me about the state level and I'm gonna move kind of quick as we got about three and a half four minutes sure state legislature here versus federal state legislatures pretty solid is it not\nIt's solid but it's not great some of the Republicans are kinda rhino and they're running as Republicans and they're not strong on our issues we managed to get most of the bill through in fact I saw a list of bills that went through this year pro gun bills it's about Fifteen of them\nAre Eighteen I had no idea I just checked the legislative website and ... the guys at this conference here this is an open carry banquet with over five hundred people carrying openly safest room and tells the safest hotel and feel though I'll tell you this I'm going to open with this one I Do my little ... feel up there [noise]\nListen guys oppose fight breaks out\nDon't shoot there'll be so many guns going on just ducking like duck and cover you don't want to shoot in the room liked is everybody's got a\nCannon you know I'm Carrying a glock and in in a cross breed holster outside the waist down and I love it\nAnd they don't shoot yourself there no your mood or what have you got what other sport goats or I've got to say you're carrying crossroads where I Am it's a little easier on my back and you know one on and you can do it and it actually may we we we may not be just a kind of make statements over here as well to write so everybody's got it I should say their best posters on everybody's\nWearing their best leather and they don't have a gun and there's a hogs leg in there and what's wrong with that nothing of course not absolutely nothing ... hotel discriminate against people based on the property they own\nThat's bad see this to me if you're wearing I'm wearing a sport coach this is an unnatural motion reaching for fire on with your right arm if you carry strong side this cross draws a much more natural motion\nBut it's up to the individual [noise] and I don't expect to have to draw in this room I don't think\nYou're going to have you if you have to we had a bigger problem on our hands and we're thinking of right now so tell me with with the remaining time that we have this is an organization that's award winning ... this is the uh of course Allen was reminding us grassroots organization of the year again yeah that the gun rights policy conference\nYou guys are at the tip of the spear your right at the tip of the ... what's your involvement in easy CDL in the legislation that you're talking about writing you've been working with disorganization Jews were preservation of firearm ownership for many many years\nWith the second front we have here is not just the Senate but the second front here there's also Bloomberg money the battleground Iran with and I know it's aggravating but I got asked the question\nNow here from the state where Bloomberg's wanting to dump money because you got the ballot initiative Arizona's a ballot initiative state the man sitting to your left is fighting vehemently in Washington yeah he's got to stop that ballot initiative and they know when we know when you know that if they're successful they're they're coming here what are we doing preemptively ...\nBar called her\nRadio foster fast powers who we are rolling\nRight along as you know well maybe you don't if you're just\nJoining us I Am I have moved the cross breed holster studios out west to my favorite part of the country that's Phoenix, Arizona the value of the sun\nWhere we are broadcasting from the Arizona citizens defense league annual meeting and I'll tell you what this was an award winning organization grassroots for a reason that I Am proud to be this year third time I've spoken here and been just been treated water if we all family to me\nBut now I speak here as a life member and sitting to my left is the president of the Arizona citizens defensively they've caught Dave it's a pleasure\nTo be here is you know every single year it's always a pleasure to see you at venues around the country we just spoke and met again at gun rights policy concerts here we are in your neck of the woods\nBrother you got a lot going on here ... ... where you've got everything I was speaking with Alan Gottlieb in the previous segment our previous hour about what you got going on in the Senate\nMcCain of course out flake out\nYou've got to fight a battle royale going on over here with about a one point shift I've seen there's a potential\nFor US Senate seat here to flip blew that blows my mind and Arizona then you've got the state issue here with Bloomberg you personally if it out front of this I've listened to what you guys have been doing here legislatively I say we because I'm a member also and boy I'll tell you what it's it's an uphill climb is that a safe way to describe it\nOh yeah well you know where you've been known as ... it's always in ... [noise] the fight never stops that never ever stop so we go on in yeah because you know no go ahead go ahead and\nWe go on and and this just keeps going guys like Bloomberg keep pouring money into everything ... pouring millions and millions and millions of dollars into the legislative elections now a federal and state\nWell he's pledged because I Love being able to sit here with you can have a natural conversation and I don't have to worry about a delay on the phone the millions and millions and millions are talking about is over one hundred million pledged he just added as you know\nAnother hundred million I'm Talking about every town for gun safety and the rest of those little he's added another hundred million to the fight for control of Congress right so this man is a quarter of a billion dollars is not more into this fight is that is that right\nWell and you know the only way we counter that because we don't have that kind of money and none of us\nHave volunteered to be the billionaire that funded up still every if everybody wants to get to go find me page I Want to be the billionaire that funds are five so have you can help me make that work please let me to do it again to find anything but but we don't have that kinda money we just we never will how do we compete with it you guys have got dumped so magic out here are the only\nWay we do is to show up and you know you've been a member for a while you know how it works we get our email us to W. W. W. dot ABC deal dot org getting our email us join up\nWe send you alert anytime there's anything moving Arizona Legislature that you need to be aware of or whether it's a committee hearings or whether it's legislation of war as those going to the governor or whatever it is good or bad will tell you about if you send your emails\nWhy why do I care as a Georgia residents about what happens here in Arizona why do I need to be why do I need to be concerned was I live here man it doesn't matter to me\nI don't get up in Arizona put my boots on in the morning I mean I Do in my heart every day but in ... but it matters doesn't it of course the dominoes all fall a this is ground zero there's this ... this is the center target for the anti gun establishment the professional gun prohibition and then we'll talk about it but they know you know I Know this isn't this entire organization those\nAnd the man so you're left Mr Gottlieb knows that if they can get Arizona fall guess what happens next with gunshot state Florida fall we've already got difficulty in Florida right now we have a lot happening down there I never thought we'd see and the quote unquote gunshots they were ... so when you add all of this up\nThe dominos do fall and what happens here boy I'll tell you what is going to be a model Nevada to bordering state another tough battle another tough fight\nIf they can bring and you've won now six years done some ammo has got this state from last male are now in court and just told us don't do them all ranks ranks Arizona number one say what six years running up to ... so so again\nEffectively tell listeners in Kansas listeners in Minnesota Michigan Ohio I Want you to pay attention to Pennsylvania they're working on anti gun laws in Pennsylvania in our day to make it a felony to carry a gun loaded and your vehicle they just never stop\nBut from the big time here they can they can nail Arizona Bloomberg wants to ... oh yeah yeah okay\nAnd you know and you are my daughter's your PC one of the big things they've got going now is the gun violence restraining order and they're pushing that real hard to get Republicans on their side pushing it and it's just another step another another brick wall like the song says\nAnd if they get that then\nWhat else can they get well they've you know you're right and that's a great way to ...\nTo get if they can because here let me ask you this rhetorical sarcastic nonetheless but I still want to ask even though I Know the answer his question and so you\nIs it ever enough for them no absolutely not so when it was if we give them let's just say that a hypothetical we give them\nAll expanded background checks because we're sick and tired of listening to Shannon lots to talk about it we're sick and tired of watching Alyssa Milano talk about it let's just give it to him and shut them up we already get a background check to buy a gun right so let's just give it to a will they dry up and go away\nWell you know it goes back to ... you know I'm a ... an hour a pistol instructor goes back to the same logic that they use when they say well you know bad guy comes and you want something for me once your wallet and want your money which you or whatever\nJust give it to him and he'll go way more if you want your life [noise] you're going to give that to\nA there are ... believe it or not sadly there are people out there that think well it's not going to happen to me and if it does [noise] guns aren't the answer is well and we see that right but it's our answer our answer is no we are not happy the lowly correct absolutely correct so let's move to another one let's move to assault weapons ban\nBecause we've got a really bright kid named David hog out there who was apparently a master of everything now he knows everything about everything I first of all he tells us that if you've ever followed his tweets it's quite astonishing\n[laughter] of course I'm being sarcastic but I haven't talked to laugh I David ... the hogs the world's system mouse but David hog now doesn't want to take away our God he just wants to take away our fifteenth so let's say we're sick and tired of David hog on the news all day every day and we say you know what fide\nLet's shut him up unless we don't need these we don't need to say are Fifteen let's give 'em to him will stop will be shut up and go away no\nNo one knows what next because you know somebody some years ago wrote an article and I don't remember who it was about moldy locks gun control and he says you know one is never enough that you know is it to heart or is it too soft or ... you know at some point you get to that realization that they are never going to stop it's always going to be something\nAnd that's the assault weapons just to put it in the door once they get those are they going to stop of course not then they're going to come for something else and this is exactly the logic that we need to remember is always in play\nThey don't stop they never stop they've gotten bits and pieces over the years they've gotten machine guns you know as they managed to outlaw those and so now we can't own machine guns new manufacturing there all the only thing you can buy now is the stuff that's already on the registry and it was closed in a sex so they keep going up and up and up and I\nUnderstand what it's all what is your question\nSo and you know what else is ... that's a that's a great question because now we got due process on line you're talking about the ... extreme risk protection orders for example to a great example to talk about due process we're talking about a fundamental tenet of our judicial system we're talking about innocent until proven guilty but wait a minute\nI just watched the Kavanaugh hearings and I never saw Democrat concern one bit not one bit on that panel did I see a senator on the left concern about Kavanaugh's rich to due process did you or am I missing something [laughter] okay so if we see them at that level they really don't care about my due process do they\nWell and this is the thing you know you actually had Democratic senators during that sharing saying that you need to prove to us that you're not guilty\nThey flat out said yeah that that is a quote yeah you're not you're not ... that's not the extent paraphrasing that was actually set\nYeah and I mean somewhere along the line somebody flunked our constitutional law class [laughter]\nSo I don't know that they've taken one of the you know I have a copy of constitutions sitting over here with me okay and I know a lot of people in this room have a copy of the constitution with them [noise]\nYou know I go over and read the constitution to my kids we actually talk about these things we put them in perspective at home and my my kids were super bright and some of the stuff they don't know anything about at school yeah and we live in a really nice area in a really conservative red area with really good schools but they're public schools\nThat individuals go this is this is a big concert with the next one minute that we have left what direction are you taking daisy CDL forward now\nWell you know we've got a governor that's pushing these extreme ... protection orders like you mentioned ah we beat them last year he's four is going to bring it back so we're fighting we're fighting to stay in place at this point we're going to try and move anything good that we can but right now we just want to make sure we don't get bombarded with that\nA Z CDL dot org is where people can go to join I'm a life member it's easy to become a member of this is the best group of people and an award winning organization for reason thank you for everything you're doing it for your dedication\nTo the cause of fighting for our freedoms in our rights as Dave Cobb the president of Arizona citizens defense weak and by the way thanks for welcoming me back and I love it it's an awful lot of ... armed American radio monster broadcast from Phoenix, Arizona their share it and at the AC CDL meeting will continue right after this we're going to take a quick break don't go away\nUm we've got a few districts that to that lean Democrat and we're making some inroads into those districts\nBut ah as far as our state legislature they understand that gun voters are very important to them and we are are in good shape to get those people elected and ah I'm feeling good about the way our local elections are going here in Arizona\nAlthough I I lost a city council race by eleven votes are in in the primary election one of my candidates so it\nCan be really heartbreaking to no question or no those let's use the state and how you feel comfortable about the state I'm pretty comfortable about the state yeah we've got a good solid Republican majority I Believe with the governor\nIs going to win again I I'm not a big fan of governor do see but he's ... better than the alternative you know you would have nobody was a big fan of a lot of people weren't big fans of Donald Trump but he was way way better than the alternative absolute I'm a big fan of Donald Trump\nLoved it and call the election the night of the election on on my radio program I said\nGo to bed tonight knowing Trump plus three hundred electoral votes will see in the morning three hundred and ... I still have people that I'm proud of this asking me to pick their lottery numbers swarm All right let's go now let me segue to the to the federal election\nI've I've talked with my previous guests over the last hour an hour and a half year in the Arizona as in a strange place\nVery when you're talking about the U.S Senate Arizona is actually look I mean it's a one point race right now today as we sit here at the ... at the easy CDL meeting in meeting the one who would have ever found that\nIn bright red gun toting gun loving history of the gun states Arizona [noise]\nHere since ... who is the Democrat running for the Senate\nUm has painted herself as a moderate Democrat and she's done a pretty good job of it uh although a lot of her history is now finally coming out and people are realizing that she was a a a democratic socialist green extreme\nRadical leftist before she started moderating in order to be able to be elected\nTo office she's like Mike Bloomberg becoming a Republican he didn't become a Republican because he believed in Republican values he became a Republican because they already had a Democrat candidate\nAnd he wanted to spend enough money to get elected in ... when it can you stay here with me for one more second sure you're very good because that we run out of time is it the shorter segment of the program of the hour what I Want to do is keep your carry on a conversation about the elections your neck deep and there's\nA lot of listeners are very very concerned about we're seeing coming up and coming up in the mid term we want to get

forget Michael Bloomberg ran as a Republican three terms in New York\nOne term one term he ran as a Republican once because the Democrats already had a candidate and they wouldn't replace that candidate with him and they wouldn't support him during the primary so he ran as a Republican\nIn order to steal the mayor ship from the Democrat he is what today though he's ... he's a Democrat today

D. to eight seven to two please don't do that while you're driving\nAll right well let's get this cross breed holster studio here in Phoenix fired back up again Jeff noxious staying with me this conversation is too important to let go\n... some of the best radio Jeff I've said for years this radio that the listener Mrs during the breaks because our conversations you know and I just said well stop because if we let it out now we're not going be able to bring it back to the Mike and it was fascinating what I was hearing you say so let's go back into what we were talking about during the break I'll let you take it away go had\nAt the national level right now the and I just wrote a column about this for Emma land is is the cabin I'll bump going to be enough a lot of Republicans and independents and\nAnd even some Democrats were very angry and upset about the attacks on Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd the way that circus was run\nAnd they were angry and Democrat numbers fell and Republican numbers climbed and and I call it the Kevin I'll bump\nThe question is is the cabin I'll bump going to be enough to see us through November the six meaning getting enough of us to the polls enough of us to the polls because frankly and my organization I Try and be a nonpartisan organization but the Democrats have decided that that I'm not allowed to be nonpartisan I\nThat that I'm not allowed I Can't endorse a Democrat um because endorsing a Democrat voting for a Democrat and everybody needs to really be clear about this voting for any Democrat in\nIn the federal elections means that you're supporting Chuck Schumer and Nancy\nPelosi okay no no you you're not saying that that's what that's that's the actual reality that's where you're going to have three hours I have to take you here for second I've been very hard on the Democrats for years I've never backed out and I've asked the question because it makes for great radio and it's quite provocative honestly\nCan a Democrat be a pro gun activists my answer to that is no absolutely not what they can be it's Democrats who like guns for the time being until whatever it is a real issue that makes them Democrats comes along\nGuns becomes a secondary issue so they can't be and you are absolutely correct no one on this show including myself has said like you just said\nThe Democrats have seen to that mhm and that's bad for those gun owners that are Democrats because that is just more proof positive of what I've said over the last couple of years that the Democrats have the party has left that\nWe used to have pro gun Democrats we used to have that many more senator Dennis ... from Arizona dad used to get in trouble because he supported senator Dennis ... Miller in Georgia Zell Miller\nChanged party he came to our site but [noise]\nHe can see after the Keating Five thing\nI think it was actually a penance that he had to pay to the Democrat Party\nBecause he carried the water on the assault weapons bill and I believe that that that was why they said we'll let you off the hook on this Keating Five things but you have to quit this pro gun stuff and quit being a friend of the n._r._a. fascinated and there you go but right now what we've got\nAn and here's the thing the cabin on bump\nUp because Kavanaugh was eventually or\nA confirmed there are going to be a lot of people that said okay yay we won that and sit back down in front of the on the couch\nAnd we can't have that you have to stay active you have to stay involved and so I think that the way to do that that what Mitch McConnell could do tomorrow to ensure that that Kavanaugh bump\nLasts on through November the sex is bring the sheer act to the floor of the Senate for a vote is everybody what it is it's been passed out of the house\nIt's sitting in the Senate to whatever committee but the sheer act\nIs an omnibus out doors hunting fishing land access bill but it also includes the I'm hearing Protection Act it also includes\nThe a lawful purposes act which I think is critically important if you don't know about lawful purposes act you'd need to look it up that's that's a great bill and I've just gone on the ... over the years you know something else he told me if I'm a because you're right Mitch Mitch McConnell is not going to do that probably not\nHe can although they promised that they would they promised a lot of things yeah man that's the biggest Republican problem is that they make promises that they don't keep and our guys say\nHell with them they don't do what they promised to do Mitch McConnell could bring up conceal carry reciprocity if you want it to absolutely he could do it today and it would have the same effect as bringing up the sheer act ... we would he could move that over if I'm not mistaken could he not bring those two could you reconcile those two together actually the\nBelieve I don't know from a vigil standpoint of ... I'm trying to remember whether that was incorporated into what was passed out of the house I don't think it was but\nAnd and even [noise] one of the tactics when you get into inside baseball one of the things that I suggested was bringing the national reciprocity act into the sheer act\nAnd then negotiate it back away again so that you get the sheer act because you say okay I'll tell you what will drop your ... give us that and\nAnd then we can come back and get that again\nYou're totally procedural strategy is too far above our heads in D.C at the stage of the game you know why I said I mean obviously Mitch McConnell knows what he can do [noise]\nHere's the problem that we have right now you bring guns up right now the liberal heads are going to pop like is it yes right now they'll go absolutely crazy and you know what that would do is more than likely I Believe Mitch McConnell might think this was ginned up their base even more which could be\nObviously we'd be straddling a very fine line there obviously if you're going to do it I don't think concealed carry reciprocity would be the way to go\nThey're going to come after that and not see gun bill but the ... is is absolutely brilliant idea a boy who do you write who do you call let's tell people where to go to get that done at least ask well you need to call your your senators both of them call McConnell's office McConnell's office um\nI used to know that it's too old to [noise] to to say no I'm not going to do it I was getting there you can remember that here on live radio sitting at a table ... you're you're more of a patriot and I thought you were ... I read it off it to your\nPC last year or just in an impromptu speech and I rattle it often somebody checked me and yes I was right but\nI'm not going to take that chance right now but just look up a congressional switchboard right and you can ask for whoever you want to talk to at the congressional switch board and they will route you there and uh that's [noise] that's worth doing send them an email\nThey've all got their messaging apps you just look them up and and send them an email\n'em but tell them we want to gun vote bring the gun vote it could help people like like a Jon Tester in Montana as well if if test or decided well hey I've got to vote for this it could help him survive\nBut at the same time it would keep Chuck Schumer out of the\nMajority leader spot as saying on the critical now we're talking about the ... the incredibly find tactical nuanced that's involved here\nThat what you just mentioned you know it could help Jon Tester survive but it could do this to Schumer we're we're in we're in a scary place in American politics today a very dangerous place in American politics today\nThat if America itself as a nation doesn't play cards right I I fear for what's coming down the ... are standing on the ... we ... we are I don't have the rocks are falling out from under our feet you know I spent the last week on armed American radio Staley defense going back in and talking about Charles Sumner Senator Charles Sumner\nSo let's get started what happened yesterday on armed American radios huge monster broadcast Alan Gottlieb let me tell you something about Alan Gottlieb\nCan't say there's enough about the man mentioned it last night I Believe in the third of our of the show when I was just kind of recapping a little bit of of what we heard from himself and for me the viewer Hawkins but\nI got to tell you this because you need to know this Alan Gottlieb is the single most influential and powerful man alive today in the gun rights movement\nThat's a bold statement to make it's also very very true if you listen to him yesterday whenever you hear Alan talk you have to dig a little deeper and pick up on some of what he says because sometimes it just goes right past you like when he said yesterday on the broadcast and our one\nWhy I've talked to the White House about okay he talks to the White House\nAbout the Supreme Court that the White House\nUses him for counsel on Supreme Court picks think about what you heard him say yesterday since we're talking to hear\nHis guidance when it comes to selection of a potential justice\nAnd with Alan Gottlieb tells you that he's content with the other names on the list you can believe that I mean you can absolutely take that to the bank\nUm ... when he's confident I'm confident I Want you to know that because I Know you turn to this program and to me here's some of these things and I want you to know that when I hear him say that I'm confident and if I'm confident I Want you to be confident very very important\nYou know the enemies of our freedom are not going away anytime soon\nI've got to pull this up for you this just absolutely drove me crazy I Believe this was on Drudge Report\n[noise] in fact I Know it was I'm going to pose up for you right now Colin Powell rips Trump on immigration NATO anti press rhetoric the world can't believe what's happening he was on CNN with that goof off for reads the car\nAnd his other panelists was Madeleine Albright what what does that tell you right there\nCan you take this guy serious at this stage of the game I don't think so you heard what Colin Powell said during the twenty sixteen election\nYeah he was all took us hurt because George Bush and as the bushes were being hammered and and Jeb Bush was being hammered and I don't think Colin Powell like that very much too bad for Colin Powell Colin Powell puts himself out as a Republican what Colin Powell is isn't establishment guy\nHe is a flat out moderate establishment guy can flip either way with the wind blows he's just this political animal of a bygone era let me let me give you some exact details is what I'm Talking about here very important I you know when you read these things you got to understand that stuff\nExample power Republican who has maintained a low profile during the Trump Administration called\nOut quote what we are not doing as the United states of America First of all I don't recall anybody asking him but he said what are we doing we're walking away from agreements were walking away from alliances why would correct Colin Powell\nWe're not walking away from agreements were walking away from bad agreements or as Trump would say bad deals were not walking away from them we are fixing them\nNumber one number two he says we're walking away from alliances were not walking away from alliances\nWe are reshaping our alliances we are fixing our alliances in large part we are fixing alliances that's understandable why he's upset because he put together some of these alliances years ago he's watching them unravel because they were bad deal\nTwenty Thirty years down the road this stuff becomes obvious things need to be changed Colin Powell doesn't like that his name is on some of these things so it's understandable why he took his hurt\nMadeleine Albright same thing going back to the Clintons these people put together a lousy crappy deal that have been costing America hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars over the years\nWe've been screwed because of some of these deals that let's give them the benefit of the doubt maybe it was a good deal at that time\nLet's just leave it at that maybe it was a good deal at that time was Iran a good deal no I mean I don't I'm not sure what Colin Powell is talking about a year but we all know what Trump is doing we're walking away from agreements\nWhat does this have to do with this had everything to do with God this guy puts himself out as a Republican he's an establishment guy he's an establishment guy that would come after your guns in fact well okay I I really don't have a whole lot of time to go into that but let's do it right now Colin Powell well let's talk about Colin Powell\nIn two thousand Thirteen on meet the press shortly after Sandy Hook\nColin Powell was asked by you up to\nOn meet the for exactly this is the best of objectivity Colin Powell was asked to get this I Love these left leaning questions right just how they hit you from what what\nKind of further restrictions wash must we put you see so obviously the basis is we have to have further restrictions what kind should we have that was the premise that was the basic question was asked\nWhat further restrictions that we need to have put in place\nColin Powell did his typical hey I'm a I'm a Second Amendment guy\nI support the second amendment I'm I'm well studied on the second amendment he said he understands the well regulated militia and he's had gone die himself every but we should be able to have done\nBut he said he saw no reason for an American citizen to own a Bush mass to remember it was a Bush master a are Fifteen that the lunatic who murdered his mother and went into the school used to murder those twenty plus kids and teachers\nColin Powell saw no problem with registration and why can't we register\nHe saw no problem with testing for both commercials sales and private sales he has no problem restricting your rights you can go watch that video on YouTube I'm not going to pull it up and play it I did go through it when I was doing some research for the show earlier this morning and it's Colin Powell views on gun control go pulled up Google it up\nYou'll see him on meet the press telling you everything\nYou need to know about Colin Powell that's why this has everything to do with God remember Colin Powell is irrelevant now\nWhy are we even talking about him\nHe's irrelevant yeah we're talking about him today because the left dug him up\nAnd we have to we will not let these statements go unchallenged we care other shows do other shows blow right past the stuff I tie their stuff together for you why because it's on the head at some of the ... right up the slack in the center column in the Drudge Report today\nWe have to talk about it and talk about it we will we are going to go back through some more of a show remember it all started with we're walking away from agreements no we're not we're fixing agreements as Trump would say we're fixing deal we're making new deal because deals you made suck\nThat's why that's what we're doing well of course he doesn't like that we're walking away from alliances no or not the alliances you made suck or fixing those alliances it's understandable why he wouldn't want to do that he was asked by a car you\nDo you think this president can be a moral leader for the world and LBJ said I don't know that he can do that because right now that is not the way he's acting recently it has become me the president as opposed to we the people this is Colin Powell lecturing us today\nOn Donald Trump\nAnd here's what power said we're going to talk about this for a while I'm going to go into this little bit longer than I anticipated because it's way too fun and because it has everything to do with your gun this is the problem with this part of the establishment in Washington and plus it's just fun to talk about on a Monday\nHow can a president of the United states get up and say that the media is the enemy of uh of American he said yes hasn't he read the first amendment you're not supposed to like everything the press says or what anyone says that's why we have a First Amendment to protect the kinds of speech\nI Hope the president can come to the realization that you should really stop insulting people Powell set\nI use this two years ago\nWhen I said I could not vote for him in the twenty sixteen election why\nThat is just weren't going to break down to the next segment\nHe insulted everybody he insulted African American he insulted women he insulted immigrants he insulted our best friends around the world all of his fellow candidates up on the stage during the debate I don't think that's what should be coming out of a president of the United states\nBut I don't see anything that's changed in the last two years\nAll bright added that Trump's rhetoric about America being a victim is\nSo not through the world is watching power said they cannot believe we're doing things like separating mothers\nColin Powell he's not supposed to be the moral leader for the world Trump is acting to fix all of the things that everybody before him that tried to be the moral leader of the world screwed up\nThat's what Trump is fixing today\nAmerica First because Powell and his cronies is un global lovers who screwed everything up and shipped millions of jobs over this is what Trump is fixing\nThat's why he's acting the way he's acting to use\nHouse terms\nIt became me the president as opposed to we the people that's not true\nThe American people not we the people of the global world of earth\nWe the people Powell means us America\nAnd pow says and you see things that should not be happening how can a president of the United states get up and said that the media is the enemy of American\nBecause the media is the enemy of American coal and you don't like to hear that I've been you know I Wonder if Trump got that for me yeah right bald bald question huh\nI've been calling the ... the press the the the wave of threat to Americans for years on armed American radio\nAnd it's great to see Trump rip them apart because they are\nHe's metaphorically speaking Powell not an enemy on a battlefield but a battlefield\nOf ideas metaphorically speaking you understand that because they are the enemy of half of this country probably more than half\n\nBecause of their left wing propaganda their gun grabbing gun hating for example for the purposes of this show I can immediately points that as an example\n\nFor their propagandize again weaponize ...\n\nWhatever topic it is that they choose to use against us whether it's Christianity whether it's done right I could go on and on but again for the purpose of this program this is armed American radio would it be difficult for me to point out you\nHow much the press you want me to go I don't have enough time in a year to go over the anti gun stores have uncovered I'm with you for years\n\nThat's why he's doing it Colin Powell hasn't he read the first amendment you are not supposed to like everything the press says or what anyone says that's why we have a First Amendment to protect that kind of speech it works both ways\nOn last year that establishment guy good heavens\nWere going to have oh I'm going to just go oh I'm going to keep going through this this has everything to do with your guns back after that\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what
