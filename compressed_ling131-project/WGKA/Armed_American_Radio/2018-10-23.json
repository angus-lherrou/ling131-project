before the ... got there actually we had a chance to shake his paw he was on his way to a meeting and couldn't sit down with us and I couldn't wait to bring him to the program such a great guy such a really neat guy\nTo talk to pioneer of all kinds of fun stuff but really commands a tremendous amount of respect when it comes to guns on TV guns in gear on TV Johnny rolling in and that this game a long time if you miss the interview\nBy all means go back and listen to what I Would highly recommend you do that\nI had him scheduled in our one while Mr ... was flying back to Seattle and wanted to

R. G.\nLots of other things going on I Want to take your today to Florida Lakeland, Florida we discussed the the commissioner the Lakeland commissioner city commissioner\nWho owns an Army Navy store I guess a a surplus store\nCaught a guy stealing and acts shoving it down his pants trying to get out of the store with it wound up in a confrontation with him shot him twice and killed him\nI told you a week ago that I Would be shocked after watching the video if that Lakeland city commissioner were not arrested in fact I was surprised he he wasn't arrested already and I'm Glad there was a thorough investigation and I know a short anybody else does that sometimes well videos look very damning\nThey're not the whole context they might be the very beginning of or the end of a confrontation that doesn't show the whole story and they're very damning in many cases if we don't know the other contact this video though\nThis was hard to take out of context let me give you a little run down as opposed to the editor of the mind I Want you to picture\nIf you will somebody in a type of hardware store taking an active small hatchet and sticking it down the front of their waste bad trying to as the store that individual was seen by the owner who then confronted him as the individual was trying to leave the store\nIndividual who was attempting to leave with the ... that he stole had gotten out the front door and was trying to get away when the owner of the store\nReached over and grabbed him by the shirt pulled a firearm had a firearm out actually had drawn and pointing at him and was attempting to bring him back into the store when the individual was attempting to leave\nIn that video I saw no overt threat made to the store owner I saw individual trying to leave now that let's separate from the fact is a criminal and he was stealing something we have a separate that for just among the individual was we\nThere was no obvious threat to the store owner at that time\nTo try to bring him back into the store maybe bring him back into the store one thing but with a firearm drawn changes the dynamic of the situation with that drawn gun attempting to bring him back into the store as the individuals attempting to pull away\nThe store owner fired two shots my comments last week were after watching this the tape appeared extremely damning I was absolutely shocked that the individual had not yet been charged there was no question in my mind that he was going to be charged with the very least\nSome type of voluntary manslaughter\nAnd at the most the second degree murder charge individual in Waco and is now charged with second degree murder and has no ... I don't expect him to see the light of day\nFor an awful long time\nLet's go over a little bit about what happened here and you don't want them to do them and use the New York times for this why not let's just see what they have to say I already know what they have to say\nBut it's I think it's important but first of all it's very important that we covered this because this is an educational this is a teaching moment here for you as a concealed carry permit holder what happened in essence was I'm going to go over to the times\nThis man Mr done he's a lake when city commissioner he was charged with second degree murder friday just a few days ago after fatally shooting the guy that he suspected of stealing the hatchet what happened was the guy sold ... he dropped it down he took it from a display wreck\nAnd he hid it in the front of his past this guy's fifty years old and he's out steel and ... All right I'm going to go back to that in a minute that's important\nYeah I I Know I Know you know you get got nothing better to do man I mean come on save save up Fifteen bucks to buy the damn hatchet whatever\nBut he dropped out in front of his path that was according to the affidavit the police affidavit\nDone city commissioner saw him do it from the office exited with his gun concealed in his waistband okay I don't have a problem with that at all done confronted Mr Lopez the ... year old who was stealing the hatchet\nAnd when he did confront him the hatch it fell down Lopez's pet legs and it fell onto the floor\nThat's at the time at that time done\nHad the gun out Lopez was said to him I Will pay I Will pay while walking according to the New York times quoted while walking over to the counter Mr Lopez then tried to leave the shop with the happy this hand\nVideo footage that we've all seen\nI don't know if you've seen it I Would absolutely watch this if you carry a firearm for self defense you need to see this because you're going to see an\nAwful lot done wrong we're going to cover some of this and the next segment as well\nThough city commissioner of the the co owner of the store Mr done reaches out and grab the sleeve what looked like sure the shirt sleeves of Lopez is the criminal and that's what he is he's a criminal he's stealing a hash it that makes him a criminal\nReaches out and grabs the shirt as he tried as he's tried to pull it back if you look at the still footage of this is obviously the momentum is trying to pull this man back into the store okay that's fine too I don't have a problem with that either the problem is he has a gun drawn on him and his pointing it at the mad as\nHe's attempting to pull him back lots of mistakes being made here all the way around in that confrontation but I digress only because we want to cover exactly what happened and not go down to many rabbit holes year what should've could've would've happened because it did what happened is Lopez was killed because of two gunshots that were intentionally fire\nMr done according to the New York times kept the hand gun pointed at Mr Lopez for several seconds after shooting while he was on the ground\nAccording to the affidavit at no time did the victim appear to have made any threatening movements towards the subject\nThat right there is a case in point because that's what kicked in stand your ground or not remember this man's the co owner of the store he has a right to be there he has a right to be safe and secure in his in his possessions and his store his place of business\nMuch like the Clearwater, Florida there were there there's a big difference we talked about the Clearwater, Florida incident where the guy was apparently arguing about the parking space remembers that the convenience store a couple three months back\nAnd I guess the the end of the the the the woman in the car her husband or boyfriend or whoever it was came out of the convenience store adequate staff and just knock that guy in the next week into the pay down onto the pavement\nHe sat up pulled a firearm and shot once hitting the individual who knocked him to the pavement in the chest that's a whole different ballgame than this\nI Want you to think about that for a second\nHe didn't fully he came out aggressively at the individual\nNow there's an argument that he took a step back when he saw the gun any good defense attorney who's going to knock that one back I think this guy has a chance in court\nTo defeat this I really truly think he does the problem we have with that case in Clearwater is you got the media involved now has a racial thing everything's a racial thing you know I'm sure the guy I was thinking I'm going to go out and I'm going to kill a black man today that's that's not what happened there were multiple people there\nIt went from his perspective a good attorney can make it look like and make it appear\nThat there were three individuals that he was facing out after being knocked to the ground and I mean he could have been killed the absolutely could have been killed he didn't know who these other people weren't you didn't know who was with them I think a good defense attorneys going to have a field day with that case again there's a lot of political pressure on it now\nBecause now you have the race players out and the haters out claiming that he's a racist and everything else\nSo that was predictable in that case this is a different ball game here I think and in this particular case in Lakeland, Florida we've got a clear cut second degree murder case I think Mr done unfortunately for him were unfortunately fortunately you can't kill people\nSimply because you have a God let the guy go call the cops none of it is worth this is it Mr done and that's what I Want you to take away from it you know I was talking about Rob think there's a couple of moments ago see here I go home and go on a roll though\nIt was a couple of years to go Rob was on the show talking about can you shoot someone who look he he gave us a hypothetical you wake up in the middle of night or someone in your house you come down the steps your arm you see someone urine aiding on your living room floor at two thirty in the morning\nYou shoot that individual\nWhat's your objective your objective is to stay safe without getting hurt and get that individual if you can out of your home\nCan you shoot that individual I Would argue that in most states you probably could claim in your castle that you were in fear for your life when someone invade your home you have a right to shoot that individual\nNo question about it nobody's going to argue that\nShould you\nJust because you can should you what if the individual starts backing up and saying yo man I'm In the wrong I was I just want to get outta here in these unarmed what do you do that do you hold him do you call nine one one you hold him at gunpoint\nThese are some of the things that we talk about we think about where do you shoot him and kill him is that really what you want to do cut the bravado I'm asking a legitimate question is that really what you wanted to ask Mr done asked the individual knocked to the pavement included\nThey suffer and everything in her to go about what you really ... how much\nFedEx delivery game go there but we don't offer by delivering water I'll be back right after this think about it\n\nThis is Michael ... than here with my style from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the
