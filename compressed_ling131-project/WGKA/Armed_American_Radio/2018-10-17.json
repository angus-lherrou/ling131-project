I'll get a little bit a little bit controversial here just a minute on that for a couple of good reasons I Want to give you some things that I noticed when I'm here in the beautiful state of Arizona which I Believe is the most beautiful places in in America most beautiful place on her\nNot to discount everywhere else but I happen to be drawn here for whatever reason colleges bizarre as it is the fact of the matter is\nArizona wins the most gun friendly state every year because of its legislative at its legislative victories over the years that have given Arizona constitutional Kerry as to what you coined the term constitutional Cary what does that mean\nYou come to Arizona you don't need a permit to carry got you're a law abiding American you come to Arizona you carry a gun you don't need anybody's permission you don't need to have a reciprocal permit you can carry your firearm in Arizona period that in and of itself makes Arizona in my book\nProbably the number one most gun friendly state in the nation so only makes sense that we get out here and of course we'll let let me segue into the second reason that I'm Out I'm a life member of Arizona citizens defense league\nEvery year their annual meetings held at this time and it happens to coincide pretty closely with the anniversary of the gunfight at the OK Corral and I try to get the two of them as often as possible this provides an opportunity to do that\nAnd it also gives me the opportunity to bring the broadcast from just a fascinating place let's go to the easy CDL meeting this year Arizona systems to ...\nI Believe that there are this is not to discount any other group all grassroots organizations around the country are incredible Kevin in Oregon with Oregon firearms federation and all the rifle and pistol clubs across the country\nVirginia citizens defensively Georgia carry a four to carry up and coming now and many many others but I Believe that Arizona citizens defense league a CDL has done incredible work\nIn this country and has probably been the most effective\nThe most effective grassroots organization in the country today and that's important for a number of reasons because again\nArizona is the most gun friendly state in the country how to get that way it got that way from a lot of assistance from activists around the country many of whom most of whom are part of a Z CDL and that makes a huge difference in the grassroots organizations when you get out here and you see the size of the group\nI Can't stress that enough to stand at that podium for the fourth time and look out at that organization of which I'm a proud life member of\nAnd the hundreds of people in attendance at the meeting why\nWhy are there are hundreds of people and attendance when gosh why are we putting so much time and effort into a state that already is widely recognized by gun owners around the nation and various publications and organizations as the most gun friendly state in the country why do we need to put so much time and\nThat's a legitimate question also begs a response and the response is how do you think they stay that way\nAnd that brings me to number three why we're here because the enemies of our freedom have a target placed right back over the beautiful state of Arizona because a V. CDL\nHas been so effective and because Arizona is the most gun friendly state in the nation I Want you to think about that for a minute you see how these things all tied together\nSo being able to come out here and speak\nTaking the opportunity to relishing the history of this of this place my history buff and me brings me here in draws me to tombstone on a regular basis ties everything together I'm able to do that and it just the timing of the the the timing of the events works now here in tombstone we are literally order we hear a\nTen days away we're ten days away\nFrom the anniversary of the battle the battle the gunfight at the OK Caracas if you were in and it was a battle or the gunfight at the OK Corral\nEldorado week begins in about five or six days runs out for a couple of weeks Val Kilmer is going to be here of course he played that\nFantastic part of ... in the movie tombstone back from Nineteen Ninety ... was Nineteen Ninety three or Nineteen Ninety four\nSo all of this stuff ties together so we're able to bring you some great programming from this beautiful place and every single bit of it getting more and more important every year in particular now as we come up on the midterms and subsequently twenty twenty why\nWho are those enemies of our freedom that have a target on Arizona's back well a former mayor of New York city by the name of Michael Bloomberg might come to mind here is why\nWhen you can't move something legislatively because your agenda is so unpopular ... you will not back down and you have the money to move it forward and your name is Michael Bloomberg\nYou're going to subvert or circumvent the system in place by that I mean Congress isn't willing to pass any new strict federal gun regulation at this point in time there is no appetite for it\nTo Michael Bloomberg care Michael Bloomberg no he doesn't care who didn't give a crap he's going to circumvent Congress how do you circumvent Congress when it comes to gun control\nThis is what we've been fighting on armed American radio for years in the fight will never end it will go on and it will go on and it will go on\nThese people are relentless and they will never stop what they're doing is using the ballot initiative that's why we've been talking about Washington sixteen thirty nine instituting twenty new gun control is on the ballot initiative that are twenty states in the country Twenty one states in the country that have ballot initiatives\nOn their books that allows the people through\nGathering of signatures to place something on a ballot during any election for a vote that intern circumvent the state legislature Michael Bloomberg has this down to a science he is spending tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars across the country\nTo circumvent federal legislation that we knew that he knows will never happen Congress\nTo Institute local gun control as the local level state level and this particular case by using ballot initiatives to do so Washington is involved in a very bitter fight right now with initiative sixteen thirty nine Alan Gottlieb of course we'll be hearing just a few minutes\nWe'll tell us a little bit more about that\nArizona is a ballot initiative state Arizona\nIs widely regarded as a single most pro gun state in the country this would be the holy grail for Michael Bloomberg we have a problem here as you heard yesterday if you are listening to the show and particularly if you are listening to the show on Sundays monster broadcast\nThere is a possibility a very real possibility in August like when I tell you this I never thought it would have to tell you this but there was a very real possibility that Arizona could\nTurn blue you heard Allen Corwin talking about Arizona changing Californians bringing California liberal left his values to the state as they flee the taxation\nAnd the liberalism if they want to try to instill in the state of\nArizona I Know it doesn't make any sense let me get out of here because I don't like it and let me take everything I don't like with me\nYou see how the disease liberal mind works more about that in subsequent programming but for now Michael Bloomberg is working behind the scenes on Washington he knows that if he can get Washington\nHe can then use those same techniques and tactics to move because Washington's a fairly blue state actually now that would be an argument those of you listening on our four stations are for affiliates in Washington would take issue with that and I agree with you you're right ... ... ... ... unfortunately the politics in your state or blue while there's a large portion of the state that is bright red\nThe politics are being dominated by blue right now and that's just the fact something that we're going to have to change for the future\nBut Michael Bloomberg knows that the demographics in Arizona are such that there is a possibility that Arizona could begin to see some blue eat and if that's the case\nThen they know that they can use the tactics on sixteen thirty nine in Washington Here in the beautiful state of Arizona that's why we're here bringing attention to this as we come up to the midterms why it's important to defeat sixteen thirty nine and Washington and it's going to be difficult as we fight billionaire money\nLeft wing billionaire money in Washington is fueling the fire Michael Bloomberg is stoking and breathing onto it with additional millions hundreds of millions of dollars we have a fight on our hands it isn't going to go away anytime soon\n[noise] Arizona citizens defense league has taken legislative preemptive action to fend that off but it won't be possible to fend off all of it it's all going to eventually come down to the voter so that's part of the reason we're here we have an opportunity to speak we have an opportunity to come out to this beautiful place give you some history\nHere in tombstone Arizona have some fun doing it while highlighting the importance of what the\nAnd just flat out lies flat out lies [noise] where's the soap\nTheir stuff is absolutely pathetic of course McCaskill has an ad from the n._r._a. imagined that she wants new gun controls on anything she can get her paws on\nAnd Missourians you must show up at the polls this is the kind of stuff that we fight against every single day and here's what makes it so difficult when you've got billionaire money you've got organizations like moms demand action at every town for gun safety these groups thrive on their ... they're good at it\nThey hide it they work at it they are professionals at it and like criminals it's hard for most law abiding citizens to realize that criminals do commit crimes for a job that's what they do\nThese people work at the seat for a job they spend their days figuring out how to deceive you and how to take things from you Claire McCaskill is one of them very very very very very disturbing and very disgusting to say the least\nLet me shoot over to Florida for just about a minute that we have left Lakeland, Florida to be exact commissioner city commissioner Michael Dunn\nConfronted and a parent criminal on alleged criminal Christophe Lopez the vets army and navy surplus store back on October third after done suspected him of shoplifting apparently he was trying to take a hatchet of some store\nThere is video out now released by the lake when pd\nShowing done restraining him attempting to restrain him pull him back into the store while holding a firearm on him it is obvious to anybody that he's carrying something in his right hand you can see is these holding up the door the criminal is\nBut the owner done the lake on city commissioner is attempting to grab and pull him back into the store apparently trying to keep him from fleeing while holding a firearm on him\nA shot two shots are fired when the individual resistant pools and tries to get back out the door we're going to be CEO seeing a lot more about this case for it if you ever want to find anything crazy can always look in Florida but this is going to be another stand your ground type deal you've got a criminal of trying to get out the door and individual holding a firearm on him\nA very reminiscent kind of of what we've seen in other cases in the state of Florida over the past few years I'm not defending myself I Am defend we've got the movie theater case someone says he's defending himself the other person says he's not a this is going to be an interesting case to watch it is after what I've seen so far\nI Am absolutely utterly shocked at this point that there is not going to charge filed against the city commissioner I Believe there probably will be here's what you've got you've got somebody committing a crime he's fleeing he's running out the door the individual with a gun is trying to pull him back in when the two shots are fired\nI'm not feeling too good about this is all caught on video I'm surprised by seeing this\nThat the individual done in the city commissioner\nIn the store who fired the two shots I'm surprised at the stage that he has not been charged I anticipate that he probably will be we will be talking about that and more of the reason I wanted to mention that to you\nBefore we go to our guest along with all the McCaskill stories you are probably seeing this on national news and you undoubtedly we'll be seeing more of it in the coming days we will be talking about it of course we'll get what they W. R. Hawkins another guest and get some opinion on it\nI'll be back from Tucson right after this don't go away\nYou are responsible person who find yourself going deeper and credit card debt them get money for a toll free number that will put you on a path to financial recovery community debt management\nWill consolidate your accounts that work with your creditors you'll save thousands and become debt free for keeps if you're a debt has your down we should talk called trinity at one eight hundred nine nine oh six nine seven six one eight hundred nine nine oh six times\nInsects one eight hundred ... sixty nine Seventy six\nThis is Larry Elder for sale and radio network over the course of the last weeks in the run up to election day we've seen a spike and what can really only be called mob like behavior and outright pleas for instability from people like Hillary Clinton\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\nOr even our former attorney general Eric Holder low we go in and of course the backdrop for all of this is protests\n[noise]\nHave your own words uncivil\nIt's also alarming President Trump may make us uncomfortable at times but look at what GOP majorities have accomplished tax breaks easing burn regulation trade deals Supreme Court appointments record low unemployment and I could go on\nDon't let the noise protesting mobs discourage you from voting this cycle I'm Larry on\nThe Pepperdine graduate school of public policy learned more a public policy dot Pepperdine dot edu\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender\nWe've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive ... shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates stays locked buddy of rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at the hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial approval only belt uncertain three year fixed rate loan precaution permission and conditions people having liquor license and all these aches and unlike number thirty thirty initial conditions are charges may apply but nobody truth to you Buddy Guy go through\nYou will have fourteen Logan passwords Andrew can remember any of them\nAre one or two does is a is awesome one two three prove it so easy to switch on car insurance I'd die go dot com Doug ... is super cool and present underscore exclamation point exclamation point Nineteen eighty by\nA bagel Fifteen minutes 'cause they'd be Fifteen Percent or more [noise]\n\nEvery body buckle [noise]\nTalk alone [noise] ...
