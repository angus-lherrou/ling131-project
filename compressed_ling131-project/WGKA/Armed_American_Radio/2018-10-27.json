somebody wrote in about it but Piers Morgan says midterms may be Trump's biggest knockout punch Piers Morgan says the midterms may be the biggest knockout punch of Donald Trump's presidency given his popularity despite attacks and the left do you know that Donald Trump\nIs more popular percentage wise and Brock Obama was at the midterms you don't hear that from the media do you know who who nope nope you don't hear any of that from you why they don't want you to hear what we've been talking about all week media creating narratives right\nHateful left in the media now they're going to attack Donald Trump because this guy had Trump stickers on his that or did he\nTalk out all over the Internet I guess it was Rush Limbaugh I read somewhere that I started this about the stickers are all new right on the van how does that happen in Florida well I've been in Florida and\nYou know any stickers you put on the car in a matter of days start to peel off it gets hot down there man okay hot they get good week\nThey get weathered so I started looking at it and it's there they were perfectly place what does that have to do with anything that everything here just it's too perfect some something's wrong we talked about it yesterday something's fishy in Florida sometimes rotten in Denmark but something's really fishy in Florida\nSo to have fun with me for the day you can see what kind of day it's going to be I'm going to be talking with my friend and your friend Andy Hoosier the voice of reason from Kate you am Andy you're ready to go down any rabbit hole we choose how you doing man\nDog Mark I'm doing great my friend is great to talk to you and I don't know I got to say it is first of its going to be fun going down different rabbit holes tonight but I Will say you said you're drinking water come up and it's a friday what do you do in drinking water\nWhat got a little cold man you know and I I was going to do some liners for you and you guys got a great new sponsor for armed American radio tells us is by the way\nWe do absolutely yeah robs gun tech and firearms their local a gun store here or they have a ... but that's actually at the store and that's their big draws actually have a gun Smith there that does a lot of fixing up and working on different a fire him through different individuals and there are new ... new sponsor about ready to come on board with cake you am and their sponsor and your show specifically so\nThat's wonderful and I was going to cut some some promos and cut a couple of spots for him today and I just wasn't comfortable doing it because I don't want that cold my voice you know and so you guys were kind enough to say yeah you it's good for Monday so yeah I'm drinking water man you know ...\nWell you know that's true but whiskey really does burn stuff out of the throat I'm just saying\nWell you know my doctor actually told me that a couple of days ago you know that was honest to God honest to God for the sore throat and stuff like that you said a little bit of whiskey is really good out with these been any with her for a long long time right\nMhm it is I mean it's the old cowboy trick I'm until you get you need to break a fever you get a sore throat you sip on some whiskey it depends on the amount of whiskey I mean if the sore throat you just do a couple of shots and that or if you need to break a fever you do a couple of more shots and to help sweat it out I'll tell you what\nI Will do the best night sleep I ever had my entire life I was sicker than a dog I came home from work I took a hot shower I took about three Advil I took a little shy to night school I took about three shots of whiskey and I was out\nFor two hours straight and I don't say oh it's good the next day [laughter] you know if you want to forget your cold at least at the time being killed a bottle right wow they really enjoy going to borrow but see then you wake up tomorrow you know what that didn't work so you're never going to vote again\nGotta be careful there man you got to be careful there no love good Kentucky bourbon you know it is good for the soul from time to time no question about it All right\nAndy I'm perplexed here okay I Want you to help me now I Know I didn't get a chance to listen to you today but I Know you were talking about this a lot of what we're going to talk about now wasn't breaking at the time you were on the air\nCorrect sure All right\nWhat do you think now we've got the Clintons\nWe've got Kamala Harris we've got now let's let's go through these looks was\nHarris hates Trump anti Trump everything comes out of her mouth waters that we need to talk about Maxine Waters and the you know you catch them wherever they are\nAnd and you kick them out you tell them they're not welcome here that's not hate speeches that now that's just the Democrat being a Democrat so to the Democrat media while that's just politics into them politics is a blood sport right and if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen that's just the way it is of course until it's turned on them that if the other way round all\nRight but we got a I guess a Obama's okay Bronx out there now talking crap about Trump All right you got Clinton is saying that what what did Hillary just recently say about about\nTrump and the Republicans you oh yeah kind of what what you say\nI don't remember exactly what she said but I mean she's come out and made a couple of statements\nYeah she said something very negative about the oh you can't be civil with the Republicans to they can't tell ya into\nUntil you take over until you take the majority\nRight you got to come back and take and they got to hold or who's talking about kicking them when they're down ... funding all this crap Brennan who is hateful all day long\nOn the news network Robert De Niro who is now all kinds of Trump hatred if we were to take a Clapper same thing by the same thing wanting to take them out and punch him in the schoolyard Booker and the rest of them if you want to take all of their statements and put them up on a big mural\nAnd you didn't put their names on there clearly it would be ... I mean certainly it would be considered some type of hate speech right\nExactly now you got all these people all of a sudden get suspicious packages\nAnd lo and behold the guys got Trump van you know he just driving around South Florida which is not from town anyway and nobody noticed is this thing now he gets popped in a matter of days all of this before the midterms what's in your gut Andy some thinking it might write something Michigan Florida that rotten in Denmark\nSomething rotten just a little bit no I agree here's the thing I ... I never want to speculate never liked speculating because especially with stuff like this it's dangerous and with the threat that came out I mean we don't want anybody\nTo be harmed in any way shape or form and I don't like to be able to speculate I like to get the facts but there's something very fishy about this because it happened right before the midterm election this was right after\nThe ... you know anti find many of the elected officials that actually are endorsing anti ... you have like you mention good Kamala Harris and you have a all these different elected officials trying to say that it's okay to go out in public give harassed Republicans and Trump supporters and then all of a sudden this comes out right after the caravan thing it's like it's stage it's set up\nA a one after another after another after another and it's all falling because none of it has worked against Trump he's right to let the campaign trail they were still able to get through Kevin ... they still\nI mean he goes to a rally and you see\nTens of thousands of people I mean he just came to speak just a an hour north of here what two weeks ago and they had over Fifteen thousand people show up in the state of Kansas when you have to travel to hours just to get to the town and you saw these this amount of people show up its massive\nHow much support he gets in everything they've tried has not worked so this I don't know I I don't like to speculate I don't like to put on the tinfoil hat and say it's a conspiracy if he is not so crazy Trump supporter than you know I don't care who it is he needs to be punished for it\nIf this is legit but why would why would this happen right before the election and what this ever had helped Trump I mean it ever let's say that one of these went out for all of them went off\nHe would become martyrs\nAnd that was would not help the Trump agenda now you can't think rationally if you're thinking of a terrorist wanting to blow up people and you write look outside the box that sense but if you're a pro Trump supporter for trying to promote a political agenda\nThis would not help because whoever is that you do end up taking out becomes a martyr and then all of a sudden the all the support those stores that group because they're playing the victim ... which they do very very well so you're right at the fact that they found this guy very quickly that they had the Trump ban all over the place that he's a big road trip pro Trump supporter\nOr we caught on very early and say wait a second this doesn't sound right now this falls into place I don't know I don't like to speculate and put on the tinfoil hat but I Am a little suspicious about what's going on\nWhere you have to be you know there's a there's a phrase for this they actually have it named it's called October surprise\n... it happens virtually every presidential election doesn't it exactly they have this\nFor both federal elections and for a local elections at the ... the October surprise always happens in the last week we're waiting for the big bombshell that happened I didn't realize that it was going to be an actual bomb threat\nBecause they've never use something like that it's always the sex scandal that comes out at the very end or or the the crazy photo of them and some weird place they're not supposed to be under some wild scandal personal attack but\nThe personal attacks haven't worked on Trump nor any of the Republicans that are sided with Trump yet so they're trying to different angle\nIf that's the case allegedly and if this comes out to be that way than it would be no surprise I mean come on they put on the for the return address to Debbie Wasserman Schultz as shields for crying out loud I mean who honestly think that it was her that that something like this but they knew the addresses come on\nYeah I Know the the the whole thing reeks it's gonna be kinda fun to watch this thing unfold it really truly is and now here's what we're we know and we'll talk about this when we come back is left is very good at this there the ... the media\nAre the same time right before an election that could devastating entire election I\nHighly doubt that that's going to be ... they're running what to say Trump created this it's his angry rhetoric it's his hateful rhetoric we need to stop him and showed him for whatever he's doing it all by the way I look at this person it's very evidence you know it was a Trump supporter Hugh had pictures of him holding up jumped sign that he's got the Trump mobility it's\nObvious that we've connect the dots that all of a sudden he's the Trump supporters Trump people or fascist and racist we would never do that because we are loving W people are even though we just kind of said look the anti fund black lives matter and all those good groups\nAnd we don't care what Maxine Waters and to say and we don't care what happens to Ted Cruz and his family and we don't care about a Steve skull east being shot by an AK forty sevens wielding Democrat lunatic want to be a staff then who are Muslim and he said a report that in the media\nThat that it's it's it's it's ... that's the whole thing again this becomes the lie of omission see the angry mark begins to come out of the box here because I Know what the media is up to I've been studying this for years I Know how they do what they do and you know why they do what they do\nAnd when we see we call him out on it and it is fun to call them out on it but they're playing a very dangerous game a very dangerous game and it's unfortunate you know Trump set of weed out yesterday\nSaying that you know the vast majority of his anger in the in the country comes from the mainstream media while the media doesn't like to hear that\nExcept they forget the fact that they are the source that people read see and hear\nDresses where their opinions come from\nBecause of what they see a challenge you listener put it down for a week\nOff the TV don't come home and watch the news turn the crap off what's your phone don't use it for phone calls and that's it and then set it down you're going to find out that you've got a life to live and guess what happens Andy when you don't watch this garbage\nYou don't miss anything you don't miss anything\nDried a next is better than friday last because you didn't have to deal with all this come and go wow you know what\nWhat did I miss today nothing nothing and it and then we'll see them go ahead go ahead\nWell here's here's ... to go along with it a little bit of I Would say especially right now during the election season\nTo really focus on what's important when it comes to issue driven agenda and none of this stuff none of the another BS or the distractions or anything else but an election time right now this is one of the most important midterms that anybody\nHas seen in a really really long time and it's time to focus on the issues and as you can see in the media it you're not going to get issue driven agenda discussions going on in the mainstream media\nNo and you already know what the issues are the impact you you already know where the people stand on that turn the crap off mute the ad when it comes on or just don't turn it on to begin with you know where you are you know what your issues are and my gosh if you're looking to people like Don Lemon\nAnd Chris Cuomo and the rest of these people or anybody I don't care who the pungent is the retired so and so to form your opinion\nI'm not sure you shouldn't even be voting be honest with you or there was a bold statement when we come back we'll continue the discussion with if you lose your the voice of reason think for yourself is what I'm telling ya\nWow we're watching the mainstream media and kicking into high gear
