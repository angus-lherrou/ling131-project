I I have no idea but\nThere is no pause push button let that process take place you're going to buy your fire depending on which state you're in you go into your license fire on dealer you say I Would like to purchase this fire and police you fill out your federal background check for him you have to answer truthfully on that or you don't go any further\nThey do the federal background check which for the most part unless it's a really crazy busy hectic day\n... and for for gun purchases it's done in ten to Fifteen minutes the tops tops you know maybe on a holiday weekend are you there when they're done specials the specials for everything going on around the country\nThat might take a little bit longer might take twenty thirty minutes unless there's a delay if there's a delay which I mean yeah you know your name matches somebody else's name that's a you know convict or\nA you know you're on the the the the terrorist watch list you know then there's going to be a delay and then they're gonna hold you back you know then then then you have to wait that's that's the purpose that background check to catch those people but\nNow unless you have your state with a a waiting period or or county or a city with a waiting period\nYou have to go in and you have to abide by the waiting period most places though if you have your if you've already gone and gotten your fires permit whether that's a\nWhatever your state causes a carry permit a a a concealed weapons permit you're you're you're you're a firearms identification card whatever happens to be once you have that most of those locations you get to bypass your your your your waiting period you have to worry about the waiting period for the fire\nBut there's still plenty of locations out there I can walk in today and say I would like to purchase the firearm here as my driver's license I Will fill out your form I Will get my background check and I will take it home\nNow that a majority for long guns I I you know I'm trying to think if there's any places would still do that with handguns with pistols with a revolver that kind of thing we've all covers um and and pistols what's your damages that is one of the other classifications for handguns underneath the ... and\nYou know a long guns you can you can you can do it you could take it home that day if the if the law allowed to try to remember there's any for the for the pistols for the side arms have to look at it I Would check out on the brake and get back to you I'm not sure\nMeat but Jimmy here you can go in there you could buy this fire him the pause button and here's what I Want to go with the second amendment and the pause button the second amendment says the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\nUnless according to Jamie you've been trained you've been licensed you've had your background check and you have this pause button to give time for that process to take place and I'm sure if she's referring to cooling down period that we saw after that you know the Brady bill came out\nOr perhaps ah she thinks that it actually takes up you know I gotta do fingerprints and send them off and wait a month for the FBI to send them back to the old school style or you know she's she's a little bit out there so I'm not sure what what her goal is with ah with with the with these a pause button but that's that's that's crazy\nJamie Lee that that's not how this works and here's here's where we can play in all the time you'll hear this folks have you've got to listen to when people talk you have to listen to when they start to talk about firearms\nBecause they're going to tell you I support the second amendment but\nDon't be a Second Amendment but I've got a list of ... proud pin that I wear a ... all the time I got it from a Mr Jerry Henry the the executive director there Georgia Carrie ... first time I ever heard it and he had the pins I don't know if it was something he coined or something the organization formed\nGoing but you hear all the time\nI support the second amendment but will stop right there stop right there if they don't support the second amendment every see me if they if they don't support the second member they are going to say but this is this is where the buck comes in I I support the second time and but ... you might as well say things like um I support the first amendment freedom of speech\nOkay this guy we know he he he was into guns we know he was using the guns in in in in the movies or you know he was going for look ... ... I could go on forever and ever and ever about his movies are that you know he uses firearms and well they're just all of them\nYou know he got to be a tough guy remember ... one of his big slogans that he used was was girly man\nHe's used to use the joke and say only ... ... don't be a girly amount there'll be the girly man and this was something a used when he ran a in two thousand four for governor of California when he ... he would start to say he would talk to the girly man don't watch watch out for the government and now let's we've seen it many times before that he um\nIn center in late Saturday Night live even used it do you remember the other characters and see if I remember off the top of my head um\nUh was Hans and Franz and we had ... and oh boy boy a brain block 'em but they were they were ... and they were here to pump you up and they would call everybody on their a girly man a girly man now\nYou know I don't know Schwarzenegger stole it from one or or or SNL stole it from a you know sports in ... but he used the term girly man\nWhen he was talking about the Democrats that he was running against and the Democrats in the California state legislature and you know whether it be the the the house or the senator\nHe also said that he was going to terminate them remember how I'm going to terminate them I'm a ... or the girl him out and they don't do anything to terminate them that was a Arnold Schwarzenegger's\nCampaign slogans ... campaign speeches when he was out there in I'm In California running well do you see what's going on we just saw the\nThe brutal attacks against a justice now justice Kavanaugh we saw that happened we've seen them against our president and how you know he'd Purdum and get you know it didn't push them often well now Arnold Schwarzenegger is as it is turn now he is now apologetic\nFor using it currently mental he says at the time it felt like the right thing to do it was in my gut I improvised and I called them girly man because they weren't willing to take risks\nThey were afraid of everything politicians in general want to do little things so there's no risk were involved I'm Sorry I probably should have done that in the accent you know remember maybe next time\nI'm he said it was a short sighted in the long term it's better not to say that because you want to work with them so now he's coming out that the the whole the whole girly man are you saying really meant is is is to me he shouldn't have said girly man because it's it's offensive\nGirl events offensive did this is a guy that carried\nYou know among machine guns and and and in blue people up and he was the Terminator and he ripped heads off and you don't you remember he'd kill people with knives that came out of his hands and he's and he says\nYou're girly man I'm going to terminate you and now he's apologetic for it he's apologetic for using these terms what has happened\nWhat is going on out there in California\nWhy are these people turning crazy or you know listen we know that the Schwarzenegger is no fan of the Republican Party anymore he when he became the governor out there he started as a Republican and by the end of his term he was pretty much a Democrat he was one of the worst things to ever happen to gun control in a in in California out there he's he's he was horrible horrible governor\nBut now he's apologetic and listen you know here's what you need to do\nI'm Sorry man up you need to man up you'll be respectful of women you'd be respectful of everybody around you and you don't have to worry about these things you don't you don't you don't talk trash to anybody you shouldn't be talking trash dude a matter of fact man or woman the women this applies to you to\nYou why all of a sudden we have to apologize for
