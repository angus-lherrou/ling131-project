break up Senate hearings we are allowed to scream and Republicans as they have dinner\nBecause normal rules don't apply to us that that that some of them but the real reason against for the opposition to Columbus Day is they regard him as a genocidal maniac is a monster how could you have to have it they named after a monster\nBut the the bigger issue is if it was Columbus or it it was Smith or it was a some anybody else it wouldn't matter it would be against him the idea that the west supplanted indigenous cultures in the western world is to them despicable\nVi V. ask leftists would've been

R. Hawkins wrote a piece about Bill Nelson and his push for gun control\nAnd in it he referenced a Miami Herald peace in the Miami Herald piece that\nHey W are Hawkins reference has a couple insightful little tidbits in it but it dates back to February twentieth than it was it was a piece of it was later updated on February twenty second but it's by no means dated\nBy any stretch of the imagination because Bill Nelson of course down in Florida who is constantly calling for gun control\nHas only done more than ... as nothing more than add to what I'm going to tell you right now I Want you to take a listen to this and we'll cut it all together during the show\nBut Bill Nelson he is in favor of quote unquote an assault weapons ban which you know\nHe voted in favor of the twenty Thirteen assault weapons ban which failed in the U.S Senate now mind you Dianne Feinstein\nOn February sixteenth twenty Eighteen just five days before this\nTweeted this I planned to introduce a bill to require all firearms purchases from gun dealers be restricted to individuals who are at least Twenty one years old if you can't buy a handgun or a bottle of beer you shouldn't be able to buy and they are Fifteen\nWell ma'am the only reason we can't buy a bottle of beer and a because I could buy a bottle of beer Eighteen but here comes your man a law\nI could buy a bottle of beer and Eighteen the only reason I Can't today is because somebody told me I Can't\nBecause of some natural law that makes it impossible for anybody under Eighteen to drink beer because somebody said we couldn't but somebody else earlier before that said we could\nKind of like what you want to do with handguns and rifles Eighteen to Twenty one year olds can buy rifles today except in certain states that in one of them in particular which is governed by a Republican\nAfter that talking about Governor Scott in Bill Nelson stay who coincidentally is running against Bill Nelson for his long held said it's the it's all kinda fits together other like a giant puzzle slap leg goes what goes for thinkers\n\nBut ms Feinstein wants to get you know\nWhy because well now they can but now they can now you see it now you know Bill Nelson once more\nThan that now but I just wanted to remind you of what Feinstein set because apparently Feinstein is like a bill Nelson's here of\nRaising the age to legally on rifles like the A R Fifteen from Eighteen to Twenty one he's in favor of that nothing has indicated his support for raising the minimum age to purchase salt rifle since the Parkland shooting congressional action to ban bump stocks he's in favor of that\nTo seal carry reciprocity act he's against that\nHe voted against the act in twenty Thirteen when it came up in the Senate purchasing guns while the terror watch list he's against that even though there is no way to tell who's on the terror watch list there's no criteria for it and they could put anybody that they don't want to buy guns on that list and thereby wiping out all due process\nCreating a national database of all firearms sailed at all firearm owners in bands all private firearm transaction can you point to one Democrat that's going to oppose that go on go on our way going give me an it come on\nTo do do do do do do do\nNone none not one how do I know this\n\nHave you ever met a Democrat ever ever\nThat hasn't embraced every one of these ... not one would oppose now without no hold on a second you might have Joe mansion who has no convictions and we'll wait to see what Susan Collins does before you decide what to do\n\nIf the Democrats were in control of White House and both houses of Congress who are Second Amendment rights are gone\nThey're done finished\nOh Supreme Court's conservative mark we'd have a that's a two three four year process after a bill has been signed into law\n\nAnd then another bill comes along and another bill comes along and another bill comes along and Dianne Feinstein is still alive\nWriting new bills banning new stuff it's nightmarish to even consider but to Bill Nelson\n\nHe wants a database national database they'll think about what that would entail think about that so you have to go back and you have to understand that that we got to take this universal background checks were just a sec\nWhat is that what's their big buzz where we need universal background checks they default that doesn't matter that the guy passed a background check it doesn't matter\nThat no background check was necessary all they'll say to regardless of any question that that will be well the first thing we should do is we should Institute commonsense legislation that we can start right now and it's common sense and and we we need we need universal background checks\nIf you ask them what that is they won't know but none of the goofy lives on the on the panels or none of the reporters asked him about that they won't because they don't know either they don't know if that ... what is a universal background\nCheck they just been hearing it so long they just think it's something that works I don't even know what the hell it is\nWhat what has to happen here let me tell you what it is it's a background check for every transaction period every personal commercial friends make no difference don't changes hands background check that's there I won't\nSay it's her holy grail because there is no holy grail there's no evidence because there's this movie all falls for another holy grail\nWhat has to happen in order for that to be even enforceable you have to have a national gun registry otherwise how the hell are they going to know who's got what God\n\nThat's why they call for universal background check that's just step one minute a year they're gonna say well it's not
