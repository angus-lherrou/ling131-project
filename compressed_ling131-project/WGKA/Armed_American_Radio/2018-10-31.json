went downstairs flipped on the television and caught the beginning of the original Halloween from Nineteen Seventy eight so I don't know if you remember when that movie came out I Do\nI remember that movie at the time being and and I say this you know remembering The Exorcist\nAs well but I Believe I think the original Halloween with Jamie Lee Curtis was no doubt the most frightening well done\nBacked horror movie I think I'd ever seen and I can say that to this day when I watched that movie to this day it is an absolute classic subsequent follow ups\nThe new remake they're not near as good they don't hold the same thing that this that the original Halloween had it had that uh that John Carpenter\nAh ah you know I really can't even just can't describe it that's how good it is it is just patently frightening anyway I watched it late last night I started fall asleep so I hit record but I it made me think about the new one and from what I'm reading about the new one I I think I'm gonna have to go\nGive that movie was shot but I I mentioned that only because it's Halloween coming up we'll have some fun with that tomorrow because they've worked ... will be here my mom's favorite gas will be here tomorrow in Wednesday's program\nSo let's get into it today lots to cover with you but again just some personal some personal don't listen to a little bit of talk radio yesterday something I haven't done and I couldn't tell you how long it's been a long long time I don't listen to any talk radio because I mean talk radio\nQuotas that have to do with anything well it's easy to pick things up\nAmong friends with Mike Gallagher I've known a long time I've interviewed him on my show I've been on his show a number of times and vice versa he's been on my show more than one bike and I are friends and and I look forward to having an opportunity to win something huge happens to be able to listen to him I was always might go to guy at nine o'clock in the morning\nI haven't heard rush and I couldn't tell you how long it's been it's been quite some time before is that listen to the to Rush Limbaugh my gosh\nI I it's an it's been in the years I mean I I flip through dials and hurt him and and moved on but I haven't sat and listen to a program or any any full length train of thought for Russian quite some time although I have read some of the stuff\nSean Hannity haven't listened to Sean in a long time I can tell you how many years it's been since I listen to Laura grim or any of the other day time talk shows the prayers you it's ... I just I don't do it because I Do it for a living and it's far too easy to pick something up that you hear someone else said that you happen to agree with\nAnd spit it out and have it come out as your own and I'll I'll I promise you I'll never do that you can go back to any radio program I've done over the years and unless it's just by coincidence because we are talking about the same thing where like minded you will never hear me repeat\nSomething someone else has said as an plagiarize their airwaves it's just to me it's not something I Want to do but I I did listen a little bit yesterday as the rhetoric eat it up I was picking my daughter up at school\nAnd I had an opportunity to throw some talk radio on and I won't tell you who I was listening to but I was honestly disappointed\nIn what I heard\nI I guess maybe it's because it's and I said this on these airwaves all the time we put a different spin on things here we type things back to the right to bear arms of course this is armed American radio and it's easy to do\nAnd I like to in the daytime show hit first round ... had over a third and then slide into home bring it all back around for you as often as possible with as many topics as we can\nOn the daytime show versus more hardcore guest driven radio on the weekend program\nBut I I was honestly disappointed in what I heard only because it was literally the same exact thing that you could turn on to every other dial as I flip through\nIt was almost as if they were all sitting in the same studio reading from the same script that disappointed me\nAnd I I feel good about the direction of this program when I hear stuff like that\nIt makes me feel good it makes me makes me know that we're doing something a little bit different while we can't help but touch on some of the same topics from time to time it makes me feel good that we at least take it in a little bit better or a better but a little bit different direction so I Hope you feel the same way I wanted to wanted to mention that\nYesterday I I kinda kinda got ahead of myself a little bit and I mentioned at the end of yesterday's program a personal story that I wanted to tell you about I mentioned earlier in the program and I ran out of the time I didn't get much you can get much time to mentioned it but just squeezed it and eat it out\nAt the end of the broadcast I kind of want to go back there again too that you know we were talking about the media yesterday and how dangerous the media\nIs and what it's doing to the psyche of the nation I'm going to go to a story here about actor James Cromwell\nWho I don't know maybe I don't watch enough TV but I don't even know who the guy is\nBut nonetheless he's an actor and he's making news today I'll tell you about that in a minute but we were talking about how the media and and phones and all this technology is doing tremendous damage to the psyche of this country and I mentioned to you as I was sitting at LAX airport a number of years ago\nThey had been too long ago\nA less than a less than ten years I think around that time anyway I was sitting at a little taco joint was having a beer and I was waiting for my flight I was early\nSo I had some time and didn't have to wait at the gate and I noticed I was standing up at one of the higher like bar type height stools table tops any way on the ... and below me to the right was an empty tables square table with four chairs and a waiter came in and sat down a young family like great looking wife\nYoung I stay a little maybe about eight to ten years old a really good looking husband you know these were just the quintessential you know upper middle class American family they appear to be\nTwo beautiful kids young girl I'd say probably Thirteen Years old and a son you know maybe ten or eleven a couple of years younger very similar to what you would see with your own family of similar to my own family\nAnd kids you know fourteen and um my daughter will be sixteen sweet sixteen go to heaven and everything that goes with that on November second but nonetheless I digress\nI watch them I couldn't help but they were sitting right next to me and I watched the mother on a on a phone and this was a blackberry so excuse me I guess it's been a little bit longer than ten years and it was around seven or eight\nAnd I noticed the father sitting across the table from her also on a blackberry the two kids were on what appeared to be the little game boys little devices\nAnd I watched in amazement as the waiter ... by the table\nThe mother ordered whatever she wanted to drink and then went right back to her device the father ordered whatever he had to drink and the two kids independently of each other did the same thing waiter came back to that the drinks down\nAsked what they wanted to eat the mother ordered what she wanted went right back to her device each one independently did the same thing and for approximately forty five minutes to an hour I watch is that family never communicated with themselves never saw any one of them look up and talk to the other family member it was absolutely astonishing to me\nAnd I thought about the comment I mentioned to you yesterday about a business partner that I had who a long time ago said to me the cell phones these computers are going to be the downfall of our kids and American culture as it turns out a very fresh and observation\nAnd it's sad when we see in America today how these devices and how this twenty four hour cycle has taken us over\nIt is causing tremendous damage and I hope that you take my advice and get off these things as much or as frequent as you possibly can as much as you can put them down quit lugging them around and I remember years ago when I used to smoke cigarettes I\nI I thought of a sudden as I got closer and closer to wanting to quit smoking I realized how stupid I was having to lug around this pack of stuff that I had to stop and my pockets are put in a shirt that I always had with me and then cell phones\nOr remember the old star tax folded will remember the start that flip bugs became popular for Motorola so here you're lugging around this thing in a pack of cigarettes you looked on filling a dope I did anyway\nAnd it gave me part of it gave me some of the incentive to just you know what the hell am I doing you know so I Hope you take that advice I Hope you put these things down and stop watching this twenty four hour cycles it's causing a tremendous amount of damage how much damage in fact is it causing well\nI mentioned to you that America was sliding into it a bit is\nThat unfortunately is going to have to correct itself for this nation to survive and that's a true statement I Know you feel that in your gut as well as I Do\nAnd I made the bold statement of stating you say to you that it was either going to happen peacefully or violently and you'd better hope that had happened peacefully\nBut those are the only two ways that this can shake out and how does it have to happen peacefully the left must stand down they must cut the satellite radio moment word\nAnd I gave you my ideas that it wasn't us that's pushing things were not the ones pushing gun control we're not the ones trying to take people's rights away from them were the ones trying to defend\nThat makes you righteous and when Trump says the media\nIs the enemy of the people it\nIs an enemy that is pushing an agenda that wants to destroy this country Trump\nIs one hundred percent correct go back to the subject of violence in America after James Cromwell\nWarns of quote blood in the streets if Democrats don't win the election I don't know who the hell this guy is I I don't watch enough TV to know who he is I don't know if he's a great beat dope I don't know if he's an a I have no idea according to this piece of says these are\nBeen in projects such as Bayh isn't babe the talking pig or something I don't know the green mile actually in the green mile I don't remember my and how do I know I don't remember him because I can see a picture of a beer\nAnd he's he just he looks like a goofy leftist you know the beer the goofy ... you can tell by looking at him it's crazy but it's true I Know you can you can tell\nThe green mile I don't remember him and I thought it was a great movie big hero sticks I've never heard of it Boardwalk Empire is not a Netflix deal or maybe it was an an a and HBO thing I remember seeing it somewhere there I've never seen the show American horror story I think that's Netflix but I'm not sure\nBut ... says he's also a political activist who is work with organizations such as Peter okay\nHe's frequently been arrested for his role and planned peaceful protests and places like the world and the natural gas power plant in New York\nSo I guess you don't see the liberals what what do they want to do they want to take away your ability to go to the world they want to take away your ability to use natural gas in New York at this power plant it's always about taking something from someone he warned according to variety I guess friday magazine\nThat he sees America taking and taking a turn that he sees America taking if Trump or the or the Democrats don't we take power in the midterms which they can't do by the way that in a minute\nBut there will be blood in the streets of Republicans remain in control now this is a guy who clearly states\nThat there should be some type of revolution armed conflict in America but the media will tell you tell you what you it's the nationalist craze white supremacy is right which is everybody by the way who disagrees with this clown more on\nThis is how they're lumping you were going to continue this discussion when we come back but think about what I'm telling you this dopey actor believes there will be blood in the street if Republicans remain in control\nRepublicans will remain in control after the midterms Donald Trump will still be
