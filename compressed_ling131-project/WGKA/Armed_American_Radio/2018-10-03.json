do with anything well gee I don't know\n\nIs he here illegally I don't know we're waiting to find that out\nOrders that had to do with their name has everything to do with everything because if you wasn't here and he's not supposed to be here a young girls puppy\nWould be alive and her mother wouldn't be traumatized\n\nAccording to this arrest report Rochelle parsing was taking her daughter's dog princess for a walk along a trail on southwest some Seventy third way around six thirty yesterday or two days ago when the dog was shot\nDown I Want you to picture this this is the editor of the mind I Want to take you transport you to the sea and I want you to picture your mother you have a dog\nI have a four and a half month old puppy in my house right now\nTo replace not to replace it's impossible to replace our other dog but to bring some joy back in\nTo the A R ranch after a very difficult year that saw my wife suffer from breast cancer beat the snot out of it by the way and get a one hundred percent clean bill of health her final treatment on that note is October tenth which is the very day she was diagnosed she gets to ring the bell and she begins leading a normal life again\nBut during that year we also had to put our precious dog down at ten years old it's it's been a tough year\nAnd after a couple of months we decided that we might like to have a little joy injected back into the house in the form of a puppy dog we got a little steep sue she's absolutely awesome her name is Riley I call her because she looks like a hoot out so I Want to take it I tell you that from a personal standpoint because I'm a dog lover\nAnd when we lost our dog was absolutely devastating\nI Can't imagine losing her in this way\nSo let me transport you to real life you have a dog I Want you to think about this even if you don't want you to think about this thing about you being a kid I think about your mom walking your dog while you're at school\nAnd the next thing you know your dog is covered your daughter's dog is covered in blood and you're on the phone with nine one one you have absolutely no idea what happened when\nPolice arrived Carson was covered in blood and holding princess was limp body several witnesses told police that shot came from a balcony at an apartment complex nearby and they said two guys ran into the apartment after the shot was fired\nSo cop showed up and went to the apartment apartment number sixteen to Concepcion Dale arose and Daniel Alvarez were inside officers also found in the apartment besides these two scum bags\nGet this a black scope palate rifle they'll let me go back to the headline for just a moment because I have two\n\nMan on balcony kills passing dog with sniper rifle only did back down deep into the story for just a second oh wait it's not that the\n\nOfficers also found a black scope palate rifle as\nIf somehow we need to make the God awful horrific story\nOf a puppy an eight month old puppy\nBeing killed by a gun bag with appellate rifle somehow have to make that work and how do we make it worse by calling the pellet gun a sniper rifle\nNow I Know snipers in fact I Know one of America's most prolific snipers and I doubt very seriously he would call that pellet gun a sniper rifle but to the media doesn't matter\nWe don't need to make it all ready horrific story worse\nBy doing this or do we what did it change your mind\nIf the gun weren't even discuss if all you knew was that somebody shot the dog from a balcony did you have to know anything about the gun in order to feel horrible\nNot only for the dog\nBut for the ... for for the mother and this little girl whose dog it is or maybe it's not even a little girl well to the mother she's the little girl even if the even if the daughter is Thirty years old it's her little girl does this story need to be made\nWorse I guess if you're a reporter the answer is yes\nAlvarez later told police Concepcion Taylor rose had said in Spanish I'm going to shoot the dog Concepcion Dale rose called the shooting an accident and said he didn't mean to shoot the dog\nSo you lean out the balcony with a pellet gun appellate rifle\nAnd take aim at a dog and pull the trigger and don't mean to do any of it\nObviously this kid as a flat outlier enough food even be in the country\nWhat what kind of question is that why would you even ask that well I'll tell you why because the name Concepcion Taylor rose speaking in Spanish and not English begs the question in today's open borders society\nWhether he should have even been here or not\nAnd that's a legitimate question to ask should he have even been here or not\n\nBecause if he shouldn't have been here it raises a whole bunch of other question doesn't it\n\nOr does that make me a racist for simply asking the question of course it doesn't I mean it does to the radical unhinged laugh\nBut to the rest of America is a perfectly legitimate question so we're going to find out I don't know I don't know how I'm going to do some big and I know some people down there and we're going to find out in fact I Know somebody on that police force down there and we're going to find out I'm going to get the answers\nIt doesn't change the outcome of what happened\n\nBut I had to transport you to this I Want you to think about this as if the story is not bad enough it has to be made even worse\nJust with the description of the tool use now if you think I'm wrong market armed American radio dot O. R. G. please if you think I'm wrong and a pellet gun is in fact a sniper rifle\nI Want to hear from you I I Want to hear from you I Want to know why you think that I Want to know I just want to hear from you let me know\n\nI guess if you're a rodent [laughter] or some type of ... the belt rifle could be considered a sniper rifle if it's like being you\nBut in terms of humans in our pets I I don't believe that's the case so we have a lot going on on that story not the least of which is a dead puppy at the hands of a real dirt back [noise]\nWho was that a twenty five hundred dollar bond I Hope rots where he is [noise] and when we come back I Want to talk just briefly about it a little bit more about the whole puppy aspect of it and then you should read some of the comments down below I Can't read them on the airwaves [noise] what is it about a puppy [noise]\nThis this is the visceral response to the ... the Internet opens us up all kinds of hate but this is the response\nTo a puppy dog why because I think all people agree that a puppy dog is innocent we all have dogs\nIt's why it's why certain types of crimes we don't feel as bad for the gang bangers shot and killed during a drug transaction or while he's trying to Rob somebody for more drug money as we do this innocent little puppy or an innocent child doing\nIt twice child molesters have special forms of protection behind bars because they can't be let into the general population lest they be killed why because criminals even murderers have kids\nThat's why children represent innocence puppies\nRepresent innocent even greater than a child in some cases\n\nBecause of this absolute unconditional love and even in this evil upside down planet we live in today\nWe still see that so\nI I just I I guess it was just a personal thing for me I've got this little puppy in the house the kids my wife my family you know just love her to death and she's been a huge breath of fresh air and family after a difficult year it it was just what the doctor ordered quite frankly so I think about that\nAnd I think what a God awful satellite radio moment word\nThing\nFor that family to have to go through at the hands of some combat who claims when he leaned out with a scope sniper rifle which of course was a pellet gun enough to do the damage but I don't know if you've ever shot today's ... schools or or rifles they are absolutely deadly\nBut nonetheless he knew what he was shooting at he was viewing it through a scope and squeeze the trigger intentionally\nNot pay for it but it's not going to pay enough for it that seems to be\nThe general consensus when you read this stuff so yeah we live we live in crappy times quite frankly I mean while there are a lot of great and a lot of good and a lot of great things happening in today's day and age we look at a we look at our politics we look at the state of a Democrat Party\nIn the United states of America destroying another human being and then we have to read stuff like this advice that [noise] just because we need another example\nOf evil on her phone [noise] when we come back we're going to talk about David hog and his tweets\nOh boy
