armed American radios huge monster broadcast Alan Gottlieb let me tell you something about Alan Gottlieb\nCan't say there's enough about the man mentioned it last night I Believe in the third our of the show when I was just kind of recapping a little bit of of what we heard from himself and for made up your Hawkins but\nI got to tell you this because you need to know this Alan Gottlieb is the single most influential and powerful man alive today in the gun rights movement\nThat's a bold statement to make it's also very very true if you listened to him yesterday and whenever you hear Alan talk you have to dig a little deep and pick up on some of what he says because sometimes it just goes right past you like when he said yesterday on the broadcast in our one\nWell I I talked to the White House about okay he talks to the White House\nAbout the Supreme Court that the White House\nUses import counsel on Supreme Court picked think about what you heard him say yesterday just were talking to here\nSeeking guidance when it comes to selection of a potential justice\nWith Alan Gottlieb tells you that he's content with the other names on the list you can believe that I mean you can absolutely take that to the bank\n... when he is confident I'm confident I Want you to know that because I Know you turn to this program and to me here's some of these things and I want you to know that when I hear him say that I'm confident and if I'm confident I Want you to be confident it's very very important\nYou know the enemies of our freedom are not going away anytime soon\nI've got to pull this up for you this just absolutely drove me crazy I Believe this was on Drudge Report\n[noise] in fact I Know it was I'm going to pose for you right now Colin Powell rips Trump on immigration NATO anti press rhetoric the world can't believe what's happening he was on CNN with that goof off for ... the car\nAnd his other panelists was Madeleine Albright ... what does that now you're right there\nCan you take this guy's theory is at this stage of the game I don't think so you heard what Colin Powell said during the twenty sixteen election yeah he was all took us hurt because George Bush and the bushes were being hammered and and Jeb Bush was being hammered and I don't think Colin Powell like that very much\nToo bad for Colin Powell Colin Powell puts himself out as a Republican what Colin Powell is is an establishment guy\nHe is a flat out moderate establishment guy can flip either way with the wind blows he's just this political animal of a bygone era let me let me give you some exact details is what I'm Talking about here very important I you know when you read these things you got to understand that stuff\nExample power Republican who has maintained a low profile during the Trump Administration\nCalled out quote what we are not doing as the United states of America First of all I don't recall anybody asking him but he said what are we doing we're walking away from agreements were walking away from alliances why would correct Colin Powell\nWe're not walking away from agreements were walking away from bad agreements or as Trump would say bad deals were not walking away from them we are fixing them\nOne number two he says we're walking away from alliances were not walking away from alliances\nWe are reshaping our alliances we are fixing our alliances in large part we're fixing alliances that's understandable why he's upset because he put together some of these alliances years ago he's watching them unravel because they were bad deal\nTwenty Thirty years down the road this stuff becomes obvious things need to be changed Colin Powell doesn't like that his name is on some of these things so it's understandable why he took gets hurt\nMadeleine Albright same thing going back to the Clinton these people put together a lousy crappy deal that have been costing America hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars over the years\nWe've been screwed because of some of these deals that let's give them the benefit of the doubt maybe it was a good deal at that time\nLet's just leave it at that maybe it was a good deal at that time was I read a good deal no I mean I don't I'm not sure what Colin Powell is talking about a year but we all know what Trump is doing we're walking away from agreements what does this have to do with guns\nThis have everything to do with guns this guy puts himself out as a Republican he's an establishment guy he's an establishment guy that would come back to your guns in fact well okay I I really don't have a whole lot of time to go into that but let's do it right now Colin Powell well let's talk about Colin Powell\nIn two thousand Thirteen on meet the press shortly after Sandy Hook\nColin Powell was asked by you up to\nOn meet the press yeah exactly uses the back of objectivity Colin Powell was asked get this I Love these left leaning questions right just how they hit you from what what\nKind of further restrictions was must we put you see it so obviously the basis is we have to have further restrictions what kinds should we have that was the premise that was the basic question was asked what further restrictions do we\nNeed to have an input Colin Powell did his typical hey I'm a I'm a Second Amendment guy\nI support the second amendment I'm I'm well studied on the second amendment he said he understands a well regulated militia and he's a gun guy himself every but we should be able to have guns\nBut he said he saw no reason for an American citizen to own a Bush mass to remember it was a Bush master a are Fifteen that the lunatic who murdered his mother and went into the school used to murder those twenty plus kids and teachers\nColin Powell saw no problem with registration and why can't we register\nHe saw no problem with testing for both commercial sales and\nPrivate sales he has no problem restricting your rights you can go watch that video on YouTube I'm not going to pull it up and play it I did go through it when I was doing some research for the show earlier this morning and it's Colin Powell views on gun control go pull it up\nGoogle it up you'll see him on meet the press telling you everything you need to know about Colin Powell that's why this has everything to do with Don remember Colin Powell is irrelevant now\nWhy are we even talking about him\nHe's irrelevant yeah we're talking about him today because of the left dug him up\nAnd we have to we will not let these statements go unchallenged we can't other shows do other shows blow right past this stuff I tie their stuff together for you why because it's on the head at some of the ... right up back in the center column in the Drudge Report that\nWe have to talk about it and talk about it we will we are going to go back through some more of an ... remember it all started with we're walking away from agreements no we're not we're fixing agreement as Trump would say we're fixing deal we're making new deal because deals you made suck\nThat's why that's what we're doing well of course he doesn't like that we're walking away from alliances no or not\nThe alliances you made suck we're fixing those alliances it's understandable why he wouldn't want to do that\nHe was asked by a car you do you think this president can be a moral leader for the world and pow said I don't know that he can do that because right now that is not the way he's acting recently it has become me the president as opposed to we the people\nThis is Colin Powell lecturing us today on Donald Trump and here's what ... said\nWe're going to talk about this for a while I'm going to go into this a little bit longer than I anticipated because it's way too fun and because it has everything to do with your gun ... is the problem with this part of the establishment in Washington and plus it's just fun to talk about on a Monday\nHow can a president of the United states get up and say that the media is the enemy of ... of American he said he asked\nHasn't he read the first amendment you're not supposed to like everything the press says or what anyone says that's why we have a First Amendment to protect that kind of speech\nI Hope the president can come to the realization that you should really stop insulting people power that\nI use this two years ago\nWhen I said I could not vote for him in the twenties sixteen election why\nThat is just weren't going to break down in the next segment he insulted everybody he insulted African American he insulted women he insulted immigrants he insulted our best friends around the world all of his fellow candidates up on the stage during the debate I don't think that's what should be coming out of a president of the United states\nBut I don't see anything that's changed in the last two years\nIs that people need to keep in mind with so many new options it can be confusing even get objective help to find a plan that may
