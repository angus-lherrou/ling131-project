parents from up things at work is not a thing and marriage is not a thing I didn't say cars I didn't say houses\nYesterday intentionally I mentioned that on yesterday's program\nThat was by design why because I knew what was getting ready to happen today here's here's a deal but let me clarify a couple of things for you for stuff I spoke to my mom early I use this as an example called her early yesterday morning so hey what are you doing she says I'm drinking my coffee and watching the news I said what do you watch and she said I'm watching Fox and friends said you're not watching the news\nShe said well I'm watching Fox News is that it's not the news that three people sit around a couch talking crap it's all they're doing is speculating and blow V. aiding\nPeriod sheer conjecture this is not the ball they're doing is chatty\nNo different than the three of us if I sit down and talk with my mom and dad and I tell you this is what I think is going on here this is what I think it's gonna happen well I think the American people this and the American people don't they don't know crap that's three people giving you their opinions on a couch in the morning while you're drinking your coffee that is not the news\nAnd that's what happened yesterday and that's why I didn't want to talk about Kevin ... there was no news the only news about Kavanaugh is what was happening today what happened today\nCulture that's what happened today the Senate voted fifty one to forty nine to end debate and go to a vote tomorrow afternoon I think it's thirty hours lets it\nThat's news that's what happened today why is that important well I'll tell you why it's important\nBecause what you saw the left due to Kavanaugh's what the left has been doing to you over the course of the last decade they just through an entire decade at him in a span of about eighty seven days really they ... they say that adamant about two week period not an eighty seven day period\nThe nomination process took about eighty seven days as of yesterday de da de ... nine days today\nRegardless they were desperate\nThey threw what they've been thrown at you as a gun owner\nThis deriving knew this calling you murder is calling you names blaming you for murders around because simply because you're a gun owner they blame you for the actions of criminal what they did with Kavanaugh was all of that thrown in ages through the kitchen sink in him in about a two week period sheer desperation from the left but here's what I knew I was going to see today\nI knew I was going to see\nDianne Feinstein stand up on the floor of the Senate and literally lie her eighty five year old tail off it was remarkable to witness\nFirst Grassley stands up gives his assessment factual assessment this is what happened on day one this is what happens seven weeks later this is what the minority ranking member did and didn't do here's what she sat on here's what ... what was the result of that\nNow any clear thinking individual knows everything that Feinstein did was working in lockstep with Chuck Schumer behind the scenes and Nancy Pelosi to derail Kavanaugh's nomination and\nDestroy his wife and the process that was all part of the plant any clear thinking intellectually honest human being understand that\nAnd today we got to see grass we talk about it he was followed by Feinstein who stood there and lied her satellite radio moment word\nOff literally lied like crazy it took her about two minutes maybe three minutes into her discussion of Kavanaugh to turn to guns\nAnd she completely mischaracterized Kavanaugh's position on fire but it doesn't matter doesn't matter what she said specifically we've talked about what she said before in the past what matters is it took about two minutes for her to go to gun\nShe hates Kavanaugh because he respects the constitution and the right to bear arms something which she does not\nEverything is okay with Feinstein that she agrees with if she doesn't agree with it she hates it and that's what we witnessed today on the floor of a Senate OK okay you got me here's\nWhat she said about\nKavanaugh today another issue that gives me great pause is judge Kavanaugh's extreme position on guns that's what she said extreme position on guns\nIn reviewing his record is judicial opinions on guns she said I'm paraphrasing pretty pretty darn close it's clear his record goes beyond beyond\nThe norm she said something to the effect that goes that the beyond the norm being meaning more extreme than just simply being pro gun she said she then went on to talk about his dissent in hell or two and how Kevin are believed that\nMillions and millions and millions and she quoted the millions and millions and millions of these semi automatic rifles or in the hands of law abiding Americans possess\nAnd she claims that just because they're possess doesn't mean their income and use so according to Feinstein it all over infinite lying Democrats socialist wisdom\nIf the guy's not flung over your shoulder or actively being put to use on a\nRange it's not get this in common you it's simply possess\nFeinstein is playing semantics she has a flat out bald face liar and she knows her hypocrisy was on complete utter total display today on the floor of the U.S Senate as was Chuck Schumer here are the two people that orchestrated\nWonder if the greatest political ... jobs I've ever seen in my entire life and so did the entire nation by the way\nAnd as it played out both of these individuals took to the floor of the Senate and blamed the Republicans for their extremism\nI I I honest to God I couldn't I was it was difficult for me to watch\nThe lies from Schumer and put an end and Feinstein today it is utterly remarkable I actually believe these people feel so beyond reproach that they are so morally superior any elite\nThat they simply are incapable of telling a lie I I I'm at a point where I just absolutely believe that well fortunately McConnell\nJumped back on there and actually Mitch put a\nPut both to bad as did Grassley in his opening remarks so we got some sanity in there and then others spoke but that's why I didn't touch Kavanaugh yesterday because there wasn't any news nothing was happening it was nothing but a bunch of blow V. aiding by a bunch of people sitting on couches to get news ... news desk just talking crap\nTelling you what they think and none of it is news it's nothing but fake news it's nothing but opinion masquerading as news none of it was new and I'll tell you what was news was John Paul Stevens former justice nine years old\nAt first they said he didn't mind\nCavanaugh I thought it was a great brilliant legal mind disagrees with him about some things but nonetheless should be seated until he saw Kavanaugh exhibit his defensive and fiery rhetoric\nWhen he came back in to give a more I've caught testimonials or to to to face the Senate Judiciary committee and the accusations that were leveled at him the baseless flat out bald they smearing live from the Democrats and somehow\nJustice Stevens former Justice Stevens has an issue\nWith Kevin defending himself in his honor and integrity and decency has a reputation\nAs a man as a father as a side as a brother or whatever you as an uncle as a human being Justice Stevens had a problem with that of course Justice Stevens is\nThe same a lunatic that said the second amendment should be repealed Supreme Court judge retired saying that he believes a part of our bill of rights should be repealed because why he doesn't like it\nIncredible absolutely incredible here's my response to Justice David I don't care what you think nobody gives a crap what you think nobody cares what you think except the lunatic left to agree with you\nThey care about what you think intellectually honest American don't rabid rabid idiot logs do\nWhat if what if Steve is position where we should have ours is the first amendment would we be paying any of the woods the media be paying any attention to him if that were his position of course not well they would they pay attention to what he said what they have a completely different take on it they'd be attacking him\nBecause they value and cherished their First Amendment rights to lie to you and to give you fake news without a First Amendment they can't do that camping with God Forbid the second amendment so these are the people that we're talking about why we didn't talk about Kevin yesterday here's what happened today\nKavanaugh fifty one to forty nine was voted culture was voted on\nAnd the nomination is proceeding\nTomorrow where Kavanaugh will be confirmed it he will be sworn in and he will be seated on this court and the rabbit left can't stand it in the meantime it's backfired their\n\nTake away their guns right they ... as I said in the presidential election twenty sixteen I Believe some people are going to be very very surprised when they wake up the day after I Believe they're going to be very very surprised to go back to gun but\nGive you a little hints of some of the things we're going to talk about on urban America radios monster broadcast the particular they W. R. hawk and now he's got a couple of great he says out that I wanted to hit you with today one of them in particular LeBron James this guy the clown he's just nothing short of a clown he's a great

Dodgers I don't want to hear Bob Costas Bob Costas was lecturing me about my guns on a football sideline a number of years ago to remember that we discussed it on armed American radio\n\nI don't like

much money as possible\nI don't want to hear it play basketball and don't do it during the off season\nJust shut up so that's my opinion what am I talking about LeBron James\nWell it's interesting
