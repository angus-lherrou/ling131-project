news what's up Josh\nChina has labeled a recent mission by nuclear capable B. fifty two bombers over the disputed South China sea as provocative and said we were solely responsible for recent downturn in relations between their militaries\nTheir spokesman also reiterated China's objections to a recent us arms sales to Taiwan and the imposition of us sanctions over China's purchase of Russian defense equipment\nQuote as for the provocative action taken by the U.S military aircraft we are firmly against it and we will take all necessary mean to safeguard our rights and interests and quote so they said\nTo be fifty two is flew over the strategic waterway largely claimed by China in what the Pentagon called a routine mission\nSeparately to B. fifty twos also flew over the East China sea where China has declared an air defense identification zone and claims uninhabited island controlled by Japan\nChina has sought to strengthen its claims to the south China Sea by building islands on reefs and equipping them with military facilities such as airstrips radar domes and the missile systems\nFive other governments clean territory and the oil and gas rich area which an estimated five trillion dollars in global trade passes annually\nDefense secretary Mattis said he wasn't concerned about the bomber flights raising tensions with Beijing\nQuote that just goes on if it was Twenty years ago and had they not militarized those features there it would have been just another bomber on its way to Diego Garcia or wherever ... said referring to a key us base in the Indian Ocean\nMad dog Mattis went on to say so there's nothing out of the ordinary about it\nSecretary Mattis is right we're doing we need to do to ensure a freedom of navigation as China's seeks to take control of a major navigation passage we have to refuse to play their little game\nAs we discussed during the service academy football review last week\nArmy suffered a heartbreaking twenty eight to Twenty one over time loss to number six ranked Oklahoma and the sooner is home stadium\nAs the game progressed in army hung in against a team that many picked for another national championship playoff plot the fact that it was a pay per view TV only event in the state of Oklahoma enraged college football fans on Twitter who are hungry for what would have been a massive upset\nOklahoma fan should have been rattled to find their team almost defeated in a game where the sooner is worth thirty one point favorite but it was the black nights post game locker room game that really made an impression\nOklahoma city's news nine ran a story about how clean the visitors' locker room was after army left the building and tweeted their appreciation\nArmy fans can take some pride but she may not have managed to upset a sea of power house with their locker room skills are unparalleled of course this begs a disturbing question if armies clean locker room and such a big deal what kind of discussing mess to other teams we behind when they visit the sooner\nTo the envy of some us troops members of Canada's military can now all wear beards provided they can do better than teach thighs but don't go full mountain man\nThe move to allow the spur which took effect last month according to the military was made to get Canadian service members more freedom in their appearance is\nThe new rules which came after extensive consultations with the troops are expected to boost morale and attract more recruit they came as neighboring service members to the south are pushing for more relaxed standards on facial hair\nLast year than US Army secretary Eric Fanning allowed seek soldiers to grow beards for religious reasons the directive it's since been interpreted to allow other soldiers to do the same including\nA soldier of the Norse pagan faith\nFor now the army's rules allow beards only for special operations soldiers in those with waivers officials have reportedly been studying the possibility of a more lenient policy looking at such issues as whether scruffy faces could interfere with gas masks\nOur sailors have also pleaded for permission to grow Crump catchers but so far the navy has resisted\nCiting concerns about the proper fit and performance of respirators and other gear\nThe same safety concerns applying Canada where under the new rules commanders may restrict feared growing but then only temporarily in circumstances where safety or operations require it\nFor example in chemical biological radiological and nuclear environment makers of gas masks and safety equipment have reportedly been looking into ways to accommodate bearded warriors\nBut Canadian defense minister hardship sides on an army veteran and seek has already patented as special could for the beard designed to work with gas masks and create a gas impervious to seal\nI oppose the idea of beers for military members excluding special ops troops part of the reason is combat ready troops never know when they're going to have to do on a gas mask or other kinds of protective stuff another reason as personal hygiene and combat areas birds do catch an old dirt and grime\nAnd finally I personally don't think of US military\nThe veterans of their report finds that carrots New Hampshire medical center accused last year of poor conditions is improving\nThe report found that the Manchester VA medical center received a rating of three which was up from two a year ago soon after allegations were published in the Boston Globe about sub par care\nWhistle blowers complained about flying infested operating room surgical instrument that weren't sterilized and patients with his mind condition who weren't treated properly top officials were removed\nThe latest report found the medical center significantly reduce the time it took for veterans to get an appointment expanded suicide prevention services and hired more staff\nEmployees also found that facility a better place to work than a year ago when it ranked one hundred and twenty seven out of one hundred and twenty nine facilities on that measure\nIt appears that lasted VA has the leadership in support of both Congress and the president to fire bad performers the poor care as a result of the corrupt senior leadership RV I always had for decades that is apparently being cleaned out\nI must have that many VA facilities have been and still do provide great care I salute or new secretary\nAnd the news this girl going to give them\nComing up on the front lines of freedom all share comments by the colonel and then when George them weren't wisdom\nI used to take a break [noise]\nKnows who died and wherever you are is the place the citadel makes it easier to earn your degree by offering master's degrees graduate
