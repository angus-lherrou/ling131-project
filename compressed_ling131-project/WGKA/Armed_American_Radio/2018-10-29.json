CD but they're not included even though they're in Europe but they'll include other countries in Europe\nUh and I'm a you know they won't include countries like Brazil or Russia or you know that obviously clearly\nMeet the income criteria and other criteria they're they're they're always why Russia is not a full member of the CD is because of the political issues that are involved not because of economic issues\nAnd um you know so I Would I go and give presentations are discussions that cut to point out what the graph look like if you include all the developed countries or if you include the ... the one that they want to go and pet but it's really\nYou know most people don't know the things they say fourteen countries up there and they just assume laws you know that must be all the developed countries I don't think most people even in their mind quickly go through and say well you know you're missing other European countries in the ... [noise] so\nUh you know it's not like the media really cares about trying to hold these people's faces a fire in the media is doing this as much as other\nYou know there are so many issues here it's not just\nThe murder rates are the homicide rate since ... issues about gun ownership so the United states\nIt's supposedly way out there by itself in terms of gun ownership you'll see claims that
