for having me I really appreciate being on\nHis in some of your background how was that you decided to focus on the healthcare system as a journalist I don't push as many people competing with\nWell there aren't sadly I Am a healthcare journalist and I've been writing about private sector healthcare for over Thirty years I write about nursing I write about health care system than about ... years ago\nOr more I had some contact with the veterans Health Administration and I didn't know very much about it I'm not a veteran and nobody in my family is so after I began writing about the VA my daughter worked for the help of ministry she doesn't as practitioner per year but I was really intrigued\nBy what you could do if you had a healthcare system I had\nDiscovered some things that that the ha had done to reduce very serious hospital acquired infections what they've done to promote teamwork which is something that prevents problems in health care and private sector health care\nHospitals don't do my job and so I became really intriguing I thought well it'd be really interesting to write a book about veterans' health care and about a national system because it's the largest healthcare system in the United states and one of the largest in the world\nSo I jumped in and I got the go ahead some folks at the VA and nice than five years researching veterans' health care and was just really stunned by what I learned about it\nWell as a veteran who has been using them for over Thirty years\nWhile I'm aware of many of these jobs are real problems I've had I've gotten very good care and I know many other people who have to go out I guess it's not surprising that a really big bureaucracy would have problems but by the same token is known worthy what they're trying to do\nWhat you know we sort of forget the VA it's big bureaucracy yes but so are most hospitals systems in America and the private sector because they're consolidating and what used to be one hospital and somehow twelve hospitals or is trying to be fifty hospitals so if you want to get away from bureaucracy\nI don't know go to Mars I mean it's everywhere you know and the thing I think that's different about the VA it's driven by mission not money and it's very accountable I mean one of the reasons we hear so much about the problem is it's accountable it's accountable to you it's comical to Congress\nAnd has its own factor general\nAnd everything is public and eventually becomes public even if they want to hide it that's not true in private sector health care I mean\nI've done a lot of work there and you know patients suffered a problem and even if they have a settlement from mount practice that sided nondisclosure agreement that they can't even talk about it to a state board of health or medicine so you never find out about the problems of the private sector", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Armed American Radio", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "15"}
