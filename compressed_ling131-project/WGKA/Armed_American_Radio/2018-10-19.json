step in your neck of the woods because you're already there you're leading the charge Montana come on now\nWe're talking about Montana\nAssociated Press Montana Public radio actually an ape you picked up on this yeah was it Associated Press a piece that Montana are empty P. R. dot org picked up Missoula patches amended emergency gun ban in public places think about the headline okay you know me\nWhat do I what what do I try to instill you every single program when you watch this stuff don't just be that headline surfer Missoula passes amended emergency gun ban in public places what makes it an emergency\nIf you're a liberal gun hating Democrat professional gun prohibition of banning ... guns themselves already emergency we talked about it yesterday health right that's what the twenty fifth district in California has done listed under her health issues for her campaign\n\nSo if you heard this this is a health issue this is a public health ice that everything's in emergency to a Democrat everything is an emergency to these\nMissoula passes amended emergency gun ban in public places this is a daunting headline let's dig a little bit deeper into this and it's funny because there's a photograph\nOf an ex de with though to through looks like six rounds on the on the top of the pace and its caption underneath it hand\nDone hand gun\nI was unable to discern that by looking at the picture of a hand gun myself hand gun to separate words and gone\nThe Missoula city council passed two ordinances banning firearms in public places that's what actually happened they passed on Monday This piece is dated October sixteen which was what\nMonday no one was Monday Monday was the fifty\nSixty that was reported by the a P we're talking this week this is Reese and stuff both ordinances past this past Monday just what four days ago banning firearms at all polling places\nSchools parks museums libraries and the city council chambers or we can have fun with this at the end I'll tell you why just a second\nAccording to the a P the first emergency ordinance that went into effect immediately due to the fact that the general election this November six while the regular ordinance will go into effect in thirty days\nSo I take it this is the first time Missoula, Montana has held in the election\nThis the first election ever held in Missoula, Montana how many polling places have been shot up prior to this coming election the answer to that is a big fat whopping zero so what makes this an emergency\nEmergency as the election is coming up what about the last election\nAnd the one before that and before that and before that and before that before that it before that\nHow long is Missoula, Montana been in existence how many elections have been held in Missoula, Montana do maybe I'm wrong because I haven't researched this\nMaybe this is the first election maybe this is the first polling place ever open in Missoula, Montana and when they open that they thought oh God we forgot to ban does we've got an election coming up and just under twenty days this is an emergency we have to pass a bad\n\nYou're following me here are you walking with me or are you seeing the stupidity of this the sheer ... beauty of this this isn't about banning guns this is about pushing an agenda one bad at a time\nIt's moving forward one step at a time this never stop the amended emergency ordinance prohibits members of the public from bringing firearms and do any building where the city council meets or to public assemblies\nPublic museums the public library\nCertain public parks on those parks are the ones that are under the city's jurisdiction and quote any other locations of public assembly where persons gather together to conduct and or administer any public election while election related activities are taking place\nThat is very reminiscent of what Georgia once had when it's public gathering laws that took the state of Georgia over one hundred and forty years to get rid of which it finally did\nVery reminiscent of that and worded it in such a way that they could probably make any public gathering any public gathering fall under\nThe constraints of this ordinance\nThe previous ordinance according to the a P only ban weapons in explosive devices in city hall\nAnd public school buildings just those two places so it's an emergency we have to give the rest of these places fixed before this election but here's what they forgot to do\nThey forgot to tell criminals\nBecause you see this is all about you you can't take your gun in these places but if somebody wants to murder a city council person they're going to go in with a gun\nThis ordinance isn't going to stop them it's already illegal to shoot and kill a city council member or anybody else for that matter\nAnd stay in your banning something isn't stopping that person that wants to do that it's only stopping the person who has no intention of doing that\nIn parks or polling place or any where else it is a farce it is fake it is evidence of what you face as a law abiding citizen every single day in America where Democrats run the ship\nMontana I'm not really sure what's going on up there I really don't know I'm going to pick on you a little bit today I've got a couple of other stories I Want to talk with you about two\nNow my programs Aaron Missoula, Montana and I want to get some feedback from you as the monster showed us I don't know

your day so I won't I'll I'll just give you information because you need to know it it kind of dovetails pretty well with what we were talking about yesterday\nWith the goofball liberal Democrat in the twenty fifth district in California that once her brand of gun control forced down the throat of every American I still I still cannot get past the level of\nPassivity the the the the level of elite system\nAnd how this stinks so bad and ... so bad of arrogance\nOf these Democrat gun prohibitions that he's twenty fifth district in congressional district in California can somehow feel that they have the authority to solve their crap down my throat not going to work I don't recognize your crap down my throat I'm never going to\nOn private gun sales within the city this is the holy grail to the left his gun grab prohibition is right now today they're constantly moving the goalposts but this is known as expanded background checks\nNow let me explain something to let me explain how

have to pay money to sell my personal property to my neighbor and I'm not going to let that happen I'm not going to do that so how are they going to know what happened there or not\nThey never will wait about a year from now a little bell is going to go off in their liberal dopey mine's hey we don't know if anybody's following our new rule we need to register these guns the only way we can do it\nWe need to register these gun well you know um somebody's going to have a problem with that but it's not going to matter why well some people are going to have a problem with that with registration I don't think we're going to be able to move on that well we don't have to let's just go to the same judge\n\nThis is this is a problem with the war you have a problem\nDistrict judge Robert ... ruling Thursday comes two years after the city council here we go again you see past a first in the state organs requiring background checks for gun purchases from private unlicensed sellers\nWhen I tell you as law abiding Americans that you weren't going to be forced to make some very difficult decisions in the future are you beginning to follow me here\n\nAm I going to follow a city council ordinance that infringes on my right to bear arms\nI'll tell you right now what I'm going to do and that is no I'm not I'm Sorry no I don't have to worry about that because I don't live
