I I hear that at the beginning but it quickly changed when I felt\nWell part of the reason and and this is very important until ... if I'm wrong in your case tell me but I think part of the reason is what you mentioned very at the very beginning they weren't that many Mexicans in Michigan so she so that was an advantage to you\nBecause when you are at an immigrant community and you can stay with that community in this in self imposed ghetto then you are primarily back and not Bob\nI agree with that because and and other cities in Michigan where I grew up there were REO so to speak but in the

back to you in Sun City west Arizona\nHi data high for being in the greater than the understanding the human experience on radio guys running it all out for us we really appreciate it thank you for that um I notice the difference between the generations I live in that he left her owner like at my ... year over Eighteen years\nAnd I notice the difference between the world war two generation which I'm we're losing very fast and uh and I've gotten a feel all alone when they leave because I think I relate more to them than any other generation but my dad's generation which is between my generation are over there\nAnd mine there just seems to be a depletion of fall\nThat make up the Arizona since ... in Phoenix it's well I've spoken to Tucson at their meeting in Tucson a couple three years ago and in Phoenix a couple of times I've I've lost I've lost track but regardless this is an organization that is at the head of the fight there at the front\nOf the fight for the right to keep and bear arms and it's an honor to be asked to go out there and do so last year I could not because of my wife's condition I was not traveling for that full year\nSo that we could do if this breast cancer think past us which we have successfully done thank God\nAnd that enabled me to get out there this year so lots going on it what was it was a real emotional week for a lot of different reasons not the least of which of course because my wife was completed all of her treatment as of a two days ago but as of yesterday actually\nWhen her chemo port was taken out\nBut because it coincides with the Arizona citizens defense league that I couldn't go to the year before I could now and it just made or a a great week a great way to wrap up what's been a difficult year with some fine fine fine people when I was honored to be able to do that\nSo thanks to you Arizona citizens defensively if you want information on easy CDL and I would highly recommend you get on their ... to read what it is they're up to because not only are they fighting for Arizona they're also fighting for you regardless of where you happen to live they are literally\nLiterally walking point for you as Bloomberg is let's just say Bloomberg\nWas hard to say his name [laughter] but yet if Bloomberg it's dumping a ton of money into trying to derail\nThe right to bear arms in Arizona which in large measure means the railing Arizona citizens defensively and there are many many years of effort you know people say well Arizona has always been gun friendly well that that might be might be true\nBut if that's the case why is it Arizona citizens defense league is necessary in the first place how many more rights do we need restored quite a few let me give you one indication of what I noticed in Arizona\nAnd I don't argue the fact that Arizona is the most gun friendly state in the country where a lot of reason however depending on what's more important to you may be places off limits is more important to you than constitutional carry\nAnd I could easily easily make that case I don't care if I can carry it without a permit some people would say\nHave a permit I don't really care I'd rather be able to carry in more places\nSo you know it speaks to one half dozen the other what's good for the goose might not be good for the gander so I've heard all of these arguments some people don't mind getting a permit some people wish they didn't have to get a permit but well that's just life some people put up with that okay everybody has different ideas different thought I Would argue\nThat well Arizona I Love constitutional carry and I do Arizona's got the freedom to come to Arizona you're a law abiding individual you don't need to ask permission and that's the way it should be nationwide should be that went off to the states eventually\nWe will get their don't believe the media we are in fact winning this battle that's why Bloomberg is requiring hundreds of millions of dollars to try to fight who us and he's going to fail freedom freedom isn't for sale\nBut well constitutional Kerry is great and it is and it should be that way I just set it off as you said I Want to be able to carry wherever I have a right to be that includes a restaurant that includes wherever I happen to do\nI saw more no guns signs in tombstone as I mentioned earlier this week in a day that I have in Georgia in a year because they just start for the most part\nNonexistent in the state of Georgia want to carry a gun into whatever stab us but you go to Georgians and business people understand that and recognize\nArizona's for whatever reason feel the need to put up a sign and they're all over the place you walk through I was walking through old town Scottsdale you'll see tons of no guns all outside in Scottsdale a you know it's not just out of this is where I happen to be but you see those in a lot of different places\nSo how do you know whether you can take your gun with you when you get out of the car to where it is you're going unless you call in advance\nMaybe you have to call and I don't want to have to do that\nI Want to know why I Want to know when I get out of my car or get off wherever it is that I'm however form of transportation I'm taking that where I Do my gutters legal\nLegal\nI don't have to worry about violating the law or somebody's policy and worried about getting thrown out\nSo those are just some of some of the arguments that we hear across the board some to some people that much to me that's very important I'll tell you that right now that's very important I Want to know I carry my gun everywhere I go\nSo Arizona What a wonderful time I had a blast I Can't wait to go back that's going to be in June if not sooner\nLook I'm going to see a lot of you Arizona over the course of the next year let me give you a quick rundown probably be out there again in February just because that's what I like to go\nI Know I'll be out there again in June for the freedom day's festivities in tombstone I'll have a lot more information about that coming up over the course of the next few months but I Will definitely be there will be in tombstone in which means also be in Phoenix\nAnd the gun rights policy conference coming up in twenty Nineteen is in Phoenix at the same hotel the easy CDL with that\nAt the Sheraton crescent in Phoenix so lots of Arizona coming up I Love this I I I'm looking forward to swell months because I Love Arizona so I'm Glad you were out there as I toured around a little bit and and got a lot of out of a lot of work done and accomplished a lot of things so that's a step back on Wednesday\nFrom that and boy we've had a lot to report\nSince we've been back we've been telling you about some of the efforts of the Democrats the ... falls

California we're talking about that liberal Ms Hill who wants California gun control for you America\nBecause why because while I'm running for Congress in California is twenty fifth district and the
