was just that you know out into stone Arizona\nAbout a week before the anniversary of the gunfight at the OK Corral but just a couple of days ago four days ago or so you wrote a piece gunfight at the OK Corral and you tied in\nThe one hundred and thirty seventh anniversary of that famous gun fight to the gun Control Act of Nineteen sixty eight\nThe gun control that was being instituted by Virgil or on the streets of tombstone at that time and you just expertly turned it right back into I sixteen thirty nine you you put it altogether absolutely brilliantly can you tell my audience about

Washington if I'm not mistaken but I Want you to I Want you to pay very careful attention to this\nNow do you correct me if I'm wrong but initiative sixteen thirty nine and the rest of America needs to pay attention to this because this is the tip of the spear this is the petri dish the billionaires are coming after you're about an issue to state\nNext and there are twenty other ballot initiative states this one is being used as the testing ground this is a proven ground for the ... day and I want you to stop me if I'm wrong but this initiative turns every single\nSemi automatic rifle redefines it and turns it into an assault rifle on the book does it not\nThat is correct every one\nWe're talking twenty two caliber rifle ... you know the old roommate denial on sixty six the river to in twenty two the model model sixty the browning\nA a a a twenty two I think is it does in nature that model you know the one that you used to seeing all the little shooting galleries around by ... class supplies all of them\nAs semi automatic assault rifles which is the invention of the the gun control lobby anyway because there really is no such thing as a semi automatic assault rifle\nWell there is today because they're getting that way you see an end again I obviously you know I'm playing this was a little word play here but there is a day because the narrative has been effectively pushed and driven by mainstream media\nAll right to the point where\nMyself on a national British radio interview just the other day when you that you're aware of that I did I referred to but I just didn't even want to argue with the host because that was limited for time we talked about assault rifles and sometimes I hear it come out of my mouth the narrative has been driven to the point right now where assault rifle and they've done this intentionally\nIs now part of the lexicon correct me if I'm wrong\nYeah no you're you're absolutely right and you know moving right along I I think ... that's that's a big problem with it the next big problem is you know when you know armed with this is ... Eighteen to twenty year old young adults people to conserve a little bit more during people who can get married\nThey can no food it's ... of their constitutional right to purchase an old any can semi automatic rifle\nSo if I make a decision to get married in Washington state of Twenty years old and buy a home\nBecause I've got a ton of money because I Am a brilliant young twenty year old and I want to have a family and I buy a beautiful house over here or even if I buy a crappy house over there and I want to be able to protect my family what happens\nYou're toast you're you're out of luck you cannot purchase any kind of a semi automatic rifle whether it's a twenty two or in a are Fifteen all of a A R cannery in any clone the ... of their platform you cannot do it\nNow and also if you're an adult overreached Twenty one and you want to buy such a rifle\nYou have to leave your medical privacy\nYou have to endure a kitten day waiting period you have to\nUh except the fact that you're going to go through annual background ships\nYou got to pay it an additional twenty five dollar paperwork she [noise] uh and you've got to prove that within the past five years you have taken Anna and completed\nA firearm safety course now wait there you've got at least two constitutional violations I think that we can talk about you've got a\n[noise] you know I let me let me go towards the exclamation points on this because there's a couple three of them I added to while I was talking with you the first one that cropped up while you were speaking is we are talking about the ... the people who don't care about this\nAnd that's to fall that's both points number one media the media bias that you point out as a journalist as you I Know it makes you sick\nTo your stomach I Know you and I know how deeply you care about this and I know how deeply you care about your profession number one so I'm sure I can only imagine how sick you are about is when you see your colleagues ignore this now the only reason here's exclamation point number one that they are ignoring this is because of a bias\nThere is no other explanation they've there isn't if I'm wrong explain it to me that's point number one\nNo I I think you're right I think there is\nAn institutional bias against anything that is pro Second Amendment would have I guess the organized media now I Will say listen I'm proud of these newspaper to flood leach five newspapers around the state both eastern or western Washington\nHave editorialized against of this thing and they are encouraging the voters and their readership to vote no however Seattle Times killed news Tribune the Herald a yeah it's a yes on ice sixteen thirty nine because we have to do some\nSomething yeah are we going to build\nSomething we need to do is where you and I would do something radically different than what they would do while they call it common sense it gets the narrative and it\nBecomes again part of the lexicon driven by the mainstream media we know a common sense is that is putting somebody with a gun in the synagogue so that eleven people can't be murdered I'll digressing do something else let me go to that other exclamation point here\nIt's not lost on me that the party of Brock Obama that the socialist Democrat Party in today's day and age the one in large measure responsible for the cop bashing that we are seeing around the country today\nIs down way this now if this were something opposite I think they'd be all over it they're not going to they're not going to go out and and and glorify law enforcement's position\nAnd this proves again the agenda that they're driving is more important than the people that they're dealing with they're not going to say anything positive about their law enforcement organization not a shock to me because they're more concerned about the anti gun narrative that this is pushing correct\n[noise] well yeah and and I will add something here too because I think this is important for your listeners both here in Washington state and everywhere else around the country there's another initiative on the ballot\nAnd every gun owner I Know what the state of Washington is encouraging everybody you know to vote no on this and that's a new should even nine forty and it wasn't an issue there is a debt\nIs Han ... police making an easy to prosecute police shooting incidents\nWhen they're taking away their protection ... and and actually the you know putting them really under the gun making them ... say\nWe will defend themselves for the public eye in the event that is they're faced with a a life threatening situation she's forty nine of what we're gonna we're gonna go into that I'm going to put my third exclamation point on sixteen thirty nine when we come back at your opinion and then we'll talk about nine forty [noise] because it all ties to go\nTo Chris fall morning time for your daily pumpkin ... as you wait for your coffee can get a
