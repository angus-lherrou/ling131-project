[laughter] I like his things you're asking you want to pull the per second door okay but you admitted that humid that you might be out there and let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania you're on with mark\nMark I got it when you heard that the Republican senator or lacking bird's eye on\nBut nonetheless about a half hour of work to do after the Mike shuts down so figure it's approximately eleven thirty before I have some downtime get to the house and chill out a little bit\nAnd it it it just makes for a very very long days you can imagine makes for a long day and it makes for a long night so not a whole bunch of sleep\nAnd then I get to wake up and I could start doing some research for the show the next day to day for Monday and it tends to make me a little bit angry and that then I get on Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday or friday for example because I Am a little bit more tired on Monday and that happened today\nWhen I pulled up I started doing my regular is at the big sites with the you know the the networks and went to Fox News Drudge Report hit the CNN and the rest of 'em and and there was a specific report on Fox\nThat came out at about eleven o'clock this morning\nDems accused of moving goalposts on Capitol after FBI pro ordered listen I don't mean to sound redundant on this but you have got to understand is a gun owner what is happening here and I feel\nA tremendous burden a tremendous responsibility on my shoulders to try to get this point across I don't know\nIf I Am making this clear enough I Hope to God I Am\nBut you have got to understand why the Democrats are orchestrating this hit on cabinet and that's what it is it is a hit Lindsey Graham apparently has seen that as well thank God\nBut it is nothing short of a political ...\nThey're going to continue they will continue to wrap this man's life and will continue to drum up accusations and they will continue to want more and more and more and more and more and I cannot stress too you enough how important is it and the things that you need to understand about why this is happening\nAs a gun owner this man is a direct threat to the Democrat gun control agenda and they know it\nIt's not just wrote the way\nIt's also the right to bear arms the two issues that the Democrats are most concerned about what Kavanaugh after they got through the little shenanigans on day number one and they actually started questioning this man the whole thing was a ruse anyway\nBut you start to issues jump to the forefront number one roe v Wade number to gun what did he will Feinstein was guns right out of the box\nAssault weapons his ruling or I guess I should say his dissent in the hell are two case making it very clear to the left\nThat Kavanaugh is the man made in the mold of Scalia and the left can't stand it\nThey know\nAnd I can hot clarify this enough they know that if Kavanaugh is seated your gun rights are safe they know that they understand that and hence\nWhy the personal destruction\nIt will say the politics of personal destruction it's just flat out personal destruction of judge Brett Kavanaugh continues and isn't going to stop and I find it interesting when I looked at the Fox piece about the Democrats moving the goalpost the similarities here\nAbout what we the ... just the parallels here are so in your face or so obvious to anybody who isn't at rest if you are even semi awake you're able to comprehend is but a lot of people don't and I need to I feel the obligation to make this very clear what am I talking about here look when you talk about\nWhat's going back to the Fox news ... dumps accused of moving the goalposts on Kavanaugh after FBI pro order of course they're going to move the goalpost\nPlay new at everybody should have known it\nThey all knew it but still there's this double into our we\nCan trust those people there are friends that they are not your friend these people hey you they hate everything you stand for and they will destroy your life in the process of eliminating you and the threat that you posted their agenda and their power grab\nAnd at some point in time to Republicans are going to have to figure this out or in this country is due but to go back to the parallels\nOh every market come out of the ... the parallels here about the things we talk about an armed American radio and hear on armed American radios daily defense\nJust cannot cannot be overstated give me an example\nMarc moving the goalposts what does that have to do with it has everything to do with God how many times if I asked you do you think they're going to go away if you\nGive them that we used to talk about expanded background checks that was the big deal back then remember\nExpanded background check we need expanded background checks so we never have another new town that's a bunch of bull and you know it no background check would have stopped Newtown and they know it the man murdered his mother blew off her face\nWith guns that he stole from her before heading over to the school and murdering murdering first graders and teachers\nKnow background check would have stopped it and the intellectually dishonest Democrats knew what they knew it then and they know it now\nYet every one of ... the talking point across the country the least we can do is expand background checks so my question to you that after Newtown\nGoing back to two thousand twelve to thousands Thirteen was do you think they're going to quit let's just say we gave it to him just shut up there's great Kate okay fine shut up enough already go\nAhead would they have gone away\n[laughter] have they gone away of course not they continue to move the goalpost nothing is ever enough for these people\nGive them one inch give them one inch and they're going to immediately scream it's not enough after they accepted okay we'll take the edge\nThen they want the terms of the agreement rewritten\nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary committee use last week's hearing over the accusations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to push unified message the FBI must investigate the allegations\nQuoting Feinstein if your very confident of your position and you appear to be why aren't you also asking the FBI to investigate these claims\nThe next day Jeff Flake of course capitulate it thanks a lot for that Arizona\n\nAnd he wanted them so they will just agreed or supplemental background investigation or supplemental means to a Democrat\nThat means wide open they'll just continue to widen the goalposts no matter where you kick the ball it's gonna cow\nSupplemental means just give us every thing we want because now we're going to be the ones deciding what's enough and what's not and they know the Republicans are so weak need they can get away with it how do they know that because they just did\n\nThey just did a couple of protesters scream at the way you look at me what I'm Talking to you I Would have said get outta my face it get out of this road how did you get in here can I ask security please play does it he looked at him and cry\n\nThese are people that have signs pre made to fill in the black\nWhen Trump made his selection who ever he selected what was going to go through this this isn't me making this up this is reality these people hate you\nAnd they're not going to stop take a listen to what Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders wrote in a weekend letter according to Fox he called for investigating whether Kavanaugh committed perjury given the very this is a quote given the very serious fact that lying to Congress is a federal crime\n\nA fundamental question the FBI can help answer is whether judge Kavanaugh has been truthful with a committee this goes to the very heart of whether he should be confined to the car said Bernie Sanders\nNow take a listen to what Connecticut Senator gun grabbing hateful Chris Murphy said yes of course there should be an FBI investigation he said but whatever they find doesn't change the fact\nThat Kavanaugh specially after his performance yesterday\nIs the most dangerous Supreme Court pick of our lifetime that is absolutely true senator Murphy absolutely true Kavanaugh is the most dangerous pick of your lifetime because you\nAre a gun hating constitution hating freak show you and your party you know what Chris Murphy you are absolutely one hundred percent correct judge Kavanaugh is the most dangerous Supreme Court pick of your\nLifetime why because he will not fulfill your agenda of the destruction of this country and\nUse the Supreme Court to do what you will stop you at every twist and turn because this man understand and will uphold the rule of law and the principal set forth by our founders in the constitution [noise] yes there he is dangerous but only if you are liberal freak show back after this\nThe possibility\nThat there may be a conservative another conservative on this court because they know and understand the importance of this one and again for the purpose of the show take it right back to your gun rights\nSo I Wish I could say that we hadn't seen this coming\nBut isn't it interesting you Everytime I'm at a cocktail party or I'm at an event or I met some type of\nOf of venue where I'm dealing with like minded people it's interesting because we all see the stuff we predict the stuff we understand is coming we want we get frustrated we said why aren't the Republicans on this committee doing this or why are they doing his wife's Mitch McConnell doing this\nAnd that that's why I said it looked like like Lindsey Graham finally had an epiphany of sorts you know the day it's like he saw it it's like he understands now hey wait just a minute these people might not be my friend\nThese people might not be my friend I could actually envision a scenario where these people might\nTry to do this to me you should see Lindsey Graham is now understanding that these people would do this to him to push their agenda forward\nIt was a or we could just keep going on and on and on but I'm going to knock that went off and I'm going to move on to a couple of other things oh you know what before I go though did you do your homework yesterday on the monster broadcast I directed you over to a piece by Laura ... that is probably the best written piece I think I've ever seen\nOf hers anyway there's this one

Tribune as the alert that I got but it is titled watch out we're next\nAnd she nailed it she absolutely males it's so Google this up\nHollis watch out we're next you'll pick it up wherever she
