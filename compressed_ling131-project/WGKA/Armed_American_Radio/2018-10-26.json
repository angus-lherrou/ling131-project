Indians and uh he adopted an Indian child now so I just am reviewing what we've said do you recall the point that you were making were should move on\n[laughter] no actually they done that so that I Would love to jump right back in the court yes was it of course I Am I understood ready to go to commercial but the point I wanted to make was that\nAt the time Jackson was actually considered as a moderate on the issue of American indian some people make a really really went after him for being as they would have called it an American Indian water\nAnd the reason was because as president as he's really cutting costs cutting the budget which he did very effectively he also was laying out tons of money for the removal of the union for resettlement west there were a lot of people who thought why is Jackson spending money of white people\nSo that read people could settle in these great areas on the great plains\nI it was really sought after land so Jackson at the time so different from the day and as you say we have no moral knew what the certainly the left doesn't have the time it was a really complicated issue in Jackson was very worried without question was worried that\nThe whites and blacks would have very very high procreate a birth rates that they were just going to destroy the Indian culture simply by surrounding them in al populating them so removal to the western territories was a way to actually protect the Indian cultures that we used to be thought now the again the execution that that was horrible\nBut his intention I think was generally a good one [noise]\nThat that's fascinating and that's one of the book or is it important book now you don't only defend him on the Indian issue you have a general defensive Andrew Jackson\n[noise] you know it's one of the things I found so I think we all do that and it's true that jets and was incredibly violent man there's just no way around that\nIn every way he was but he also had really certain rules so that violence never ever could be applied to women or children that was the same actually for blacks as well as for Indians in white\nGive a deep respect strangely enough or or beautiful enough yet a strange interesting respected women are buried deep respect\nTo the point actually he's almost ... times and he treats again Indian women as well as black woman in white wearing very very well but the other thing I found about him so he's got this violence but he's got his ethic that's really interesting but I also found Dennis and you know counter so many current politicians the guy was just\nUnbelievably honest in everything he did and you ... I think it would it kill his soul to have done something that would have been misleading or dishonest that\nThat's how much of a stickler he was about living out this deep deep profound honesty and integrity really quite stunning\nHow did he get the I I ... how did he get his a bullet wound\nOh well somebody had a couple of getting quite a few good things in a number of Jules back he had been preaching in that scene as a Thirteen year old he fought in the American revolution along with his brother and they had actually been captured at\nJackson during imprisonment and mouth off to a British soldier kicked that that sort of the hill to his sword and actually beat in Jackson's goal or even and fill it with Jackson died of a dope male could still lay a finger in that ...\nAnd it wouldn't be actually even with the rest of the school that's how deep it was that the kind of being ... would never forget by any means but I'm sure you were thinking\nBy the way it would either I I we have very little time but I bought ... from you was such a scholar and folks you really should read this book I Can't wait to read this\nOr is it is it fair to say and totally different would be if it isn't he hated the British more than he hated Indians\n[laughter] I don't think there's any question about that this is yeah you just didn't cross Andrew Jackson and because that soldier did that go ahead Jack I never ever\nThat's what I thought you are a delight and are the folks the book is in defense of Andrew Jackson scrupulously on us guys you can see the joy to speak to him\nAnd will do it again and or go to a prayer for Hillsdale ...

nice guy saying he's never going to cut me off but that was funny I see I I Wish you could have heard that anyway he put a loop in my ear when I said that because I Can't hear out a one year it sounds like I got three loops going on so\nThat was fun All right I'm going to say something here that's going to be a little controversial when to start the day off with this because I'm disgusted by what I'm saying well let me start with this you know if you've been listening to me\nFor oh gosh I don't care how long have you listen to this program for four years you've heard it a million times more important if you listen to the Oscar broadcast for ten years you've heard it for ten years I lay blame\nAt the foot of the mainstream media for a large percentage of what his ailing this country today who\nDo you do it's not their fault that's where you get your information pal\nThat's where you read what you read here what you hear and see what you see\nIn in today's day and age twenty four seven and a twenty four hour news cycle and I have been warning you for years that a propaganda driven biased mainstream press that is in the tech for the left is Democrat Party\nIn the age of twenty four hour news cycle is doing horrible damage to the psyche of this country\nIs in large part responsible for the division in this country and the deep hatred people have for one another now but wait a minute\nHow can that possibly be well tell you if you take your face out of the media and you put your damned phone's down you quit reading all the crap twenty four seven you turn off the twenty four hour garb by\nAll of it and live your life for about a week you won't hear any of this crap\nYou won't know enough to hate your neighbor because you didn't see it bombarding you twenty four seven and I've been telling you for years how dangerous the media is in this country today and then I've often you go back and listen to the ...\nGo back and listen to the tapes for ten years I've set it the damage that this is causing in this country\nAnd I have made it very clear that's making it even worse is the fact that you have the media largely in the tank pushing an agenda not objectively giving you the news\nNeil Armstrong stepped on the news on the mood today twelve fifty nine pm that Reagan knew\n\nWhat he had for large what they thought he was wearing whether or not it was ... isn't new its opinion it's garbage\nRetired people all day long spewing crappy you all day long is not news that his opinion and you know twenty four hours cycle we've lost new it's gone we're never going to get it back\nTrump coined the term fake news and its stock and that's what he's referring to and you go back and you you go back and listen to what I said ten years ago that none of this was going to get better and it's not\nJust with Donald Trump said in a tweet today a very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused by them purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act\nPresident Trump I'm Sorry to disappoint you that's never going to happen the cat is out of the bag the shark has been jumped it's never going to be put back in the bag ever again it's out it's twenty four seven it's anywhere and everywhere you see it\nAnd it isn't going to change\nAs a result of that you have a terrible wedge being driven between people in America today because this is what they see this is what they hear other conversations with neighbors we talked about this\nSitting around a fire pit having a cold beer and the conversations have deteriorated into an argument simply because of what someone sees or hears from some stupid pundit\nWho gets face time on TV\nThese are very dangerous times in America so let's bring this altogether to today a lot of suspicious packages out there ...\nLots of them\nWho's plant and those ...\nI don't know the timing furious suspect isn't it yeah timing is supposed to be suspect here's my controversial statement\nWhat all this is said and done assuming the FBI is able to find out who did this you're going to find some ... goofy dopey left is wacko\nAt the root of this thinking they're helping the party before the midterm by making Donald Trump and all conservative Americans look like the haters the media's been cramming down our throats for two to three years now saying that that's what we are\nWhen Ninety two percent of the coverage that comes from a Harvard study\nDoesn't come from me\nOf the president of the United states is hateful garbage rhetoric not that you get what you get to that you get Maxine Waters embolden to be an idiot you Eric Holder Eric withhold her on this show still never gave us the documents you get him embolden to be an idiot and say we pick up\n\nYou get hate filled rhetoric from the left that has been ongoing now since Donald Trump won the election because they can't stand you won the election\nAnd now this perfect opportunity to blame Trump for everything they've been doing the violence erupts from the left and they blame Trump\nVery very dangerous times very perilous times we are living in fascinating times what does this have to do with guns it has every flipping thing to do with guns because this party of hate filled rhetoric wants your guns ask yourself why\n\nI went off script there I didn't mean to but I'm Glad I did I feel better no food or drink in Studio ... hold on a second let me take a sip\n\nWhat's your drink and mark violating the rules of honor microphone I'm drinking an ice cold Coca Cola in a bottle Mexican made with real sugar and it is super cold and it's very carbonated\nWatch out let's go to my fan favorite guests today I'm going to get all of his perspective on all of this leak the gun writer Williams is going to stay with us really hourly how you doing brother [noise]\nGood rather hope you're feeling better I have three words of advice for your cold good dark rum [laughter]\nWell you know I can give you one word martini you [laughter] and none of that house the medication is is this working thank goodness but yeah you're right ... ... ... yeah that's nice nice and warm right\nI'm yeah I'm up so that we have but what do you think we've got about a minute left [laughter] what are you\nAbout this crap what are you thinking about what I just said\nI Love it or what you described Tuesday I called the advent of the news actor where there are the personality more than a reporter more than the traditional anger you see Anderson Cooper Don Lemon a stories written about them as though they're involved in the new store using verbs like slams her beach down\nHer calls out or dishes [laughter] yeah that's it you nailed it and uh unfortunately that's you know seems to be where we're headed in t._v. bank thankfully you know we are not [laughter] but yeah you're absolutely spot on the news actors man they're taking control there there's a story\nThe news actors I'm Glad you said that I haven't heard it put that way let me give you a real life example Megan Kelly but let's go there you go to Megan Megan Kelly has been in the news that\nNow we're going to get ready to take a break so hold off of that but when we come back I Want to go to Megan Kelly for a reason because she highlights exactly what you were talking about the news actors and it's very important today in when you see what I'm seeing right now more pushes packages\nInterrupted it's the whole thing stinks\nNo south let's let's go let's go there boy until you hit on all cylinders brother because that as gun owners we face that right there for decades have we not\nWe certainly have sir\nWe this is nothing new to us what we're seeing now masquerading as news is nothing new to gun owners we have been a victim of this garbage reporting for I dare I say decade now\nI I've been talking about for ten years that's one decade and I'm sure it just didn't happen when I went on the air Tom Russia has been talking about it for gosh two and a half decades so that's plural I can say decades\nBut when you when you point out what you just Don Lemon buyers backing Trump\nWhen somebody is watching ... will stay warm Washington I'm watching the news what do you watch them watching dumb and you're not watching the news\nYou're watching Don Lemon fire backing Trump and you ask is that his job I'm going to ask you is that his job Mr journalist Lee Williams the gun right or the real journalist from Sarasota Herald Tribune is that his job\nNot at all no not at all he's a news actor he's acting and and and that kind of crap requires a script to know you can report what the president says you can report what the opposition says period\nAnd he has a columnist who's the columnist there are columnists who are paid to have their opinion I'm a gun columnist okay I've obviously kind of pro gun here so I have an opinion that's different the problem is when you're they're not labeling\nOpinion an analysis or straight news anymore it's just all coming across the airwaves and one constant twenty four seven barrage and and the viewer who is brain is turned ... this has a hard time distinguishing between news and opinion or news and analysis and I think that's their goal\nWhat that is their goal and what if I take you to heart what you just told me is that it's scripted number one and number two\nThey you think that's their goal\nSo that leads me to believe that well gosh that's an agenda driven plan is not\nBeing\nIt has to be there is no other explanation for it right\n[noise] absolutely and we as gun owners have been suffering as for years because you were there were they were all given some kind of tacit license to have incredibly slanted incredibly biased stories about guns that could be chock solar errors and no one cared I mean if if I or one of my guys\nHas an error in one of their stories we correct it\nI mean ... it's marked on line that the story has been changed it's in the next day's paper as a correction but there's there's there's no accountability here as we all know all the people with a gun we've suffered this for decades to I mean ... chains are being that comes to mind\nThey felt they yeah what a great place to take a break because that's enough to make you throw up your lunch or mid afternoon snack good Avon chainsaw bayonets wild yeah we saw that just recently when we come back with Lee Williams I have some other things I Want to talk with you but I don't want to point out to you when we come back to the evil was real\nThat evil exist don't get leaves opinion on it and they don't want to ask him about\nA court order and a judge down in Florida going after state preemption you know Florida\nGolly we're we're going to talk about you for the next half hour or at least a large part of it any way\nYou got issues down there
