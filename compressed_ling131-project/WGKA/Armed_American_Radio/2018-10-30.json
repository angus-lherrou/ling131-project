I go on with that but I'm not I'm going to stay where I'm at Dr John why joined the in the third our of the program yesterday and as John always does\nJohn was John he has every single fact and number two backup everything he says he simply\nHe can't have at every twist and turn you but you know John is frustrated right now and I played an audio clip I won't play again here today but John was frustrated and he put out about a minute forty second somewhere around there audio tape\nOn social media than he recorded\nAn extremely frustrated about what is it going to take\nFor these people to understand that gun free zones are murders a gun free zones are getting people kill John has research we discussed it on the program yesterday or the monster gas that shows that easy that these events\nAre plan as little as six months in advance to back up to two years in advance\nAnd the evidence that John refers to into show last night is overwhelming that these killers\nPlan where they go specifically so they can rack up a body count they mentioned into their manifesto at what point in time are we ever going to be able to convince\nGutless spineless politicians intellectually dishonest individual and some that are clearly suffering for mental health problems who are so overwhelmed\nAnd have to feel the need to attack millions of Americans such as she added watch\nThat their push for continued gun free zones is getting people killed at what point are we going to be able to convince those people the answer to that as we are not they're not interested in fixing the problem they're interested in making more money that's been shattered watts case bringing in more do even more than Bloomberg supplier\nLooking fundraising off of this is just sickening it's evidence of a bigger problem as far as I'm concerned\n\nIt it's it's awful it's awful but nonetheless it's expected\nNo we're not going to change their minds it's it just it is what it is when it comes to these people they are not concerned about fixing the problem there simply concerned about their agenda our and money it's it's sad but true\nI opened up the program yesterday with a really fascinating exchange that I had the whole thing started very interesting yesterday morning\nI got a phone call early\nIn the day\nAt a early was early early is a relative term right if you're a person that sleep still Pan Am I Am as early it was about it was about nine nine thirty eastern time I got a call from a a British producer who I I get a lot of calls from them in situations like this I Do a lot of interviews oversees\nThis one was leading Britain's conversation obese the Ninety seven point three radio\nKevin Maguire is the host I've been on the show with Kevin before Kevin is looking for red meat I understand his game he's not interested in quote unquote debate he's interested in attacking is gas in this case me or in an attempt to I don't know compensate for whatever it is you feel he needs to compensate for\nWith his ... some of these people look for red meat radio Kevin is one of these guys\nI'm going round and round with Kevin before it's not my first rodeo when Sunday what to expect\nBut the producer they're so nice over there it's it's so hard to say no I'm busy\nAnd mark Hey Mike the LDC we drove to have you on the show today with Kevin could you talk with just a little bit it's it's so there are so friendly him here so nice though hard to say no but I didn't want to say no I wanted to do the interview and I knew what to expect from Kevin\nSo having said that\nI agreed to do the interview Fifteen minutes later the LDC producers called me back and I found myself on the air with Kevin McGuire he originally went to a reporter is first guest was a reporter for the Pittsburgh Post Gazette a gentleman by the name of Paul I didn't catch his last name\nBut Paul was a stream Lee thorough and his response to Kevin question about what can be tuned to stop these Mad Men with guns\nAnd ah I I Can't say that you know the guy didn't come across I don't know anything about Paul from Pittsburgh Post Gazette when he was one hundred percent rational his response was essentially look unless you come up with less Americans pass a law on all Americans agree to take every gun and somehow do that\nThis isn't a this is very it's impossible to stop it very difficult very complex issue he would say\nAny continue to point out the gun control laws simply don't work no new laws go stop someone else and Kevin did not question him at all he left a journalist speak from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nThen came to me and the attack began\nAnd I I started by admitting that I've bought Paul was correct I thought it was I was listening I thoroughly enjoyed it\nAnd I started to elaborate on some of those things I did it politely I did it graciously I never lose my cool when I'm On the air with them over there if you lose your cool you lose the argument first one to lose their cool loses the argument and it's always Kevin McGuire I guess the biggest kick out of it\nHe simply cannot accept the fact we talked about background checks\nHe wants background checks to stop these lunatics I reminded him\nThat the killer in Pittsburgh and about thirty other's past background check\nHe said we've got to do something of course everything he asked war we already have and then he can't propose anything different and I began to flip the question on him and said listen I'm interested in hearing what you have to say tell me what would work let's let's do what you think would work and he immediately goes to banning guns which of course isn't going to work in the United states he doesn't want to hear that he gets off the\nPicks up his little toys runs out of the sandbox cause basically Cosby an idiot slammed the phone down says we're all in just that you're not interested in your thoughts and prayers any ... and he hangs up knock out the whole thing is on video because he's televise doing this show\nBy the way what on earth as American gun most have to do with us here in the u._k. shouldn't we just bought out it isn't like the u._k. if such a fantastic place crime is through the roof of there were more murders in London last year the New York\nAnd throw a Martin Palmer's the guys got it together over there very well written response and by the way I did destroy him that's why he got mad and hung up picked up his toys and left the sand box because the only way he could win an argument with me was if I wasn't there are participating with them because you can't argue with somebody who's being nice to him and actually giving him facts so\nGo watch it if you can find it out there I don't have to wait for the full interview\nBut you'll enjoy it it's always fun to go round and round with the Brits who you know are going to hate your gun rights though wouldn't it be interesting\nTo have somebody contact us to talk to us a little bit about what happened you know what before I go to Kentucky let me go to Donald Trump real fast yeah\nI got to go here let me see how far I can take this when the media\nDonald Trump is all over the media and I am absolutely loving it lead story on drudge I haven't looked at drudge since I started the show it's been a while I don't know if this is still up but I have it up here on my computer screen I pulled it off on one of my monitors and it is Trump accuses media of stoking great anger in us\n\nAnd it starts from the New York post despite calls for him to cool was overheated rhetoric after the deadly synagogue shooting and pipe bomb mailings President Trump on Monday continued as of salt on the fake news media by continuing to accuse them of stoking rage\nQuoting Trump there is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media of the true enemy of the people must stop the obvious in the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly you wrote on Twitter\nQuoting that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony fake news must and\nDonald Trump is absolutely one hundred percent correct\nI have told you for years\nThat twenty four hour news\nBeing pushed by biased outlet that isn't new CNN's not news

when you've got a guy like Jim Acosta CNN bashing the president on during the mass of journalism and people watch him think they're watching the news\nThat is exactly what Donald Trump is talking about that is what I've been telling you about for ten solid years on this program that the media is the enemy of the people they are doing the bidding of the left\nAnd they are absolutely working to
