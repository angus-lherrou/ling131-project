year and I've been coming back to the city every year since then I think about Eighteen months without a stretch and I got to tell you pulling into town today you have done in unbelievable job here at the place looks great\nThank you thank you well it to you know it takes a lot of a coordinated effort with all of the merchants and the citizens to make the town look as good as it does today and a dinner on them and I like to talk about the citizens are\nIn a which by the way I don't know if you told your listeners but as of today you become a U.S on or a citizen of tombstone Arizona the town to to die and along with salad and over here and I was a pleasure for me to be able to make you fellows both of you are\nOn average citizens of tombstone\nWhile what I'm going to do is I'm going to shake your power right now and thank you because I Want to listen or it's the as you know radio was theater of the mind we've got a couple of plaques here and I can't I Can't tell you it almost brought tears to my city of Tucson honorary citizen presented to mark well by the ... and in addition to that you handed both Alan and I\nAt golden keys to the city of two so and I got to tell you\nThat to me is one of this is one of the coolest things I've ever gotten in my life thank you very much bars\nWith my honor I Will tell you though a market it doesn't work on the job you can't\nGet out and Joe I have absolutely no intention of finding out I Do know that they were hopeful over the next two days that were here that will be able to talk with the sheriff listen quickly because your time is very valuable I Know you have another meeting used quite the history of tombstone you didn't just get here\nNo I'm actually force the generation native of tombstone my great grand dad came here in Eighteen Seventy seven it was a a reporter for the San Francisco chronicle doing a story about a boom in southwest and capture drowned them all\nAnd ended up the cap what you could move up to Eighteen miles west of here\nAnd they told him about a fellow man I met ... made a big strike here and he ended up over there become friends with him and it wasn't long after that to give him a contract to how timbers into the end of the new newly found mines and we've been here ever since\nYou know I Know I Know a lot of the history of the town so we and I've told my audience over the years the story of ed shuffling and\nHow he was told how the town got its name that he was told by the guards at Fort which you can now that he would find is you know what are you doing going out there in the middle of the night and Apache cut you off what are you looking for he said he was looking for silver and gold he says they told him and you tell me if it's true\nAt all he was you'll find out there's this tombstone and that's how he named his first strike is that true\nThat's absolutely true we are actually the ... and ... and had a had a unique way of name and his mind and claims and his first one called tombstone he called a tombstone because that's what the soldiers out their temperature could totally all you're going to find out there it does your tombstone\nAnd uh and and believe it or not the next uh\nSiamese decked out what is called the graveyard\nOf what I think it's fascinating to me is that your grandfather your great grandfather and doing that now after that strike he went back to Illinois which we will see from Illinois and he raised enough money with his brother to come back out and this is when tombstone exploded from that point forward\n... much yes from that point forward or it wasn't long have you had a a prospectors coming from all over and uh all over the the country mostly rent from Nevada um northern Nevada northern Arizona tombstone to stick their claims and that's how it started\nAnd now tombstone became in this made national news and I want to talk with you a bit about it now it became the first America's first second amendment city how how does that tell me about that\nWell you know it's it's only appropriate that ah tunes don't recognize the second amendment since uh you know we're famous for a lot of things that are mostly for the gun fights a\nBut also were famous because we've always believed in having firearms to protect ourselves along the Mexican border and we're a\nAnd you know and I'm not talking about bad about Mexicans are are Indians but we had to watch out for the Indians too so the second amendment was important back in the Eighteen hundreds just as just as it is today\nBy often say I use the phrase that the city not not just the city what state of Arizona real at America in general but where we sit in our particular was built on the gun is that a true statement\nWell uh I I think that would be a true statement yes or\nNo you're getting ready to again because we have just a couple of minutes I Know you have another point but but you're getting ready now to celebrate Eldorado day here in tombstone that starts next weekend this coming weekend and it kicks off of course eight October twenty six is the virtue of the one\nThat was ...\nThe big gunfire ... stone famous um\nA wider the was successful in getting tore out about the gun fight when he moved away from Arizona into California and the ... to it's become very famous down worldwide\nNow is that a good thing for the city of tombstone let us know for the gunfight at the OK Corral\nWell I you know it's what it's a lot of folks\nThink the tombstone as the Old West is anonymous with with the tombstone\nThat doesn't mean that tombstone supports treating people down in the streets right there just means that we know order history is then we know how important was to have the guns back in the Eighteen hundreds as well it is today\nOr in the you know wider and his brother actually went to ... brother perjure was ... was the actual Marshall tombstone\nAnd they actually tried to control the guns by making the guy's either carrier gunner or check it in a and they weren't allowed to carry guns in town\nAnd a lot of people don't realize I've talked about it on the show but this was early form of gun control by ... it was not very successful in town was\nNo it wasn't didn't actually that law was on the books up until the seventies and somebody challenged it and said you can't do that that's against the state statutes in the constitution Second Amendment and to the judge overruled an overturned up ordinance\nAnd did away with it so that you can carry a firearm anywhere in the city of ...\nIt is absolutely and I am carrying right now I Hope that's okay right I'm going into some yoga okay good I'm going to things that you know it's fascinating because that the gunfight at the OK Corral of course was actually fought over gun control emerge or from the boys walked right down the street outside where we are now down Fremont Street made a leftover by flies photography studio\nAnd said we're here for your guns one of them went for it and ... said\nHold that's not what I Want over for\nGun control some threats by the by the folks who were actually violating the law right\nThat that's absolutely correct than to actually didn't start just that day they'd been warning the decline\nFor that you can\nShare your guns in tombstone we've made the lawn you're gonna live by the law and ah that that that day was the more than point where it finally blew over and and the ... to ... you know I Wonder sometimes as many shots as they shot and there was only a couple of guys here and\nNow let's talk a real quick and we've only got a couple of minutes but it was a if I'm not mistaken about thirty four seconds was the total fight summer didn't last thirty five seconds to wrap it fired shots when often succession to this day we don't know who fired the shots is that right\nThat's correct the there's no record is there is no way to prove which who shot the first show\nWas your grandfather hearing are great grandfather here in town at that time Jesse was\nDo you have any writings are stories I mean this is fascinating Alan Gottlieb is sitting across from me and he's he's grinning from ear to ear with each question with these with each answer we've had a long time coming trying to get it going to talk to him shortly but does do you have any family heirlooms of recollections or anything from that\nWhile I Will tell you that uh my grandad\nOr and my great grand dad ah we're pro Clinton the climbers they were ranchers is that right really Clinton had eighty some dollars in his pocket when he was killed over here in that eighty some dollars had been paid by my great grandfather for breaking some horses foreign so\nWow see I I'm just sitting here is\nThat is a fascinating story Mr Mayor were coming to the end of the segment I I can sit here and talk for hours and hours and hours I Hope you get the opportunity in the future okay thank you so much that's Dustin ... of

Second Amendment rights so ... started at a gratitude\nAnd you know what I think the school about what you just said\nIs to store may be a very small place but it is widely recognized when you hear the name tombstone people know they know tombstone it might be what twenty six hundred residents are somewhere around ... hundred Fifteen Fifteen hundred so it yeah Fifteen hundred there's not a lot of residents are small town but it's got a big name\nWell mainly have Fifteen hundred residents but how many tourists as a kid a year a lot more than Fifteen hundred now in Eldorado days is coming up you and I will be gone at\nThat time were here right at the heart of held ... days but at the ... that is designed to\nDeal with not designed to but what it does is it celebrates the ... you know just the history of folk worthwhile to think about all the color of her characters who came through you saw a great today that said I don't even remember his name but he was shot Frank Leslie Frank Leslie was one of the most notorious gun fighters in the Old West\nAnd I would guess you're probably more of those names up there probably wasn't price only victim right probably not\nDay do you see that graveyard is the amazing piece of history a and it was a great privilege to downtown itself to the fish are doing that first and then you look at the city I Can't wait actually for ... you get out of
