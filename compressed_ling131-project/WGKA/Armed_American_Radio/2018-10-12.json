forty out the door by for it's a short sweet and powerful meeting\nSo I'm looking forward to that that will be on Saturday can't wait to speak their now on Sunday I'm going to be bringing you of course the monster show from out west but we're going to do something a little different\nI may take some of it in advance I might have all of it depending on the amount of people that I'm able to bring together for the show these are people that I I have a very difficult time getting in a room altogether alone let alone just on telephone to bring them into the show at the same time so\nIt it it's going to be so good I Can't even tell you who's going to be on the program yet because I just simply don't know\nBut I did speak to the organizers of the event we've got a place to sit and talk to people as they come off the stage at the easy CDL meeting this is a a meeting with great important as we head into the midterms\nAnd into twenty twenty now explain more about that over the weekends broadcast so I'm either going to bring you a full taping because I've got all these wonderful people veiled you made an error Sunday or\nI'm going to do a combination of both\nBut I Will have some amazing people sitting with me including Alan Gottlieb who will be sitting with me in Arizona and out this gets even harder\nIf that could be if that could be the case because on Monday if everything works out the way I expected to now\nI Will actually be broadcasting from tombstone Arizona with Alan Gottlieb and the founder into stone of making tombstone America's\nFirst second amendment city I'm going to leave it at that I'm teasing you something I'm not positive about yet but my goal is to bring you the show from that history rich city\nTown of tombstone Arizona which I have done before in the past bidding on the heels of this week which is that are pretty fun history lesson\nThroughout the last four days of armed American radios daily defense and we're going to continue that again today I Hope you've enjoyed the programs this week I was in fact I Know you have I've gotten more email than normal let me read just a couple of them as I pull some of these up live with you on the air\nOr this just came in today are from fab he wrote earlier this week\nMark I wrote you a few times this week and this was because the shows have been so powerful I wanted to let you know I sent a message to my mother this morning then re posted my message on an NRA social media page and in doing so I invited all those on the page to join the radio waves and tune in to your show hopefully your numbers increase off of it\nHere was my message on my post I Hope you are listening to the armed American radio shows this week if understanding the threat of what really is of what reality is and how America is not only at it in any logical disagreement\nBut past the threshold of one side for control at any expense the other try to live at ease while playing by the rules listen to it\nBut like dealing with criminals when only one side plays by the rule book the others will always live in a state of defensive awareness or die blind and unprepared\nThe next on civil war slash American Revolution is stirring that's from Joshua Joshua thanks for the email well done I wrote an excuse me I read one of ... was emails earlier in the week that one just popped in earlier this morning\nThis one came in from Ken Thompson mark you've really been bringing it this week I was wondering how you would follow up your analysis of Colin Powell I wasn't disappointed the Charles Sumner and Hillary discussion was fascinating to say the least\nThen he goes on to tell me that earlier this year he read a book called Nineteen Seventy Nineteen Seventeen written by Arthur Herman the book about two men president Wilson and Lenin\nArthur Harmon is no pundit of any kind left or right he just gives you the quote unquote news as it was in history and so history tends to repeat itself\nThe book describes Wilson's progressive ism where it came from and how it was implemented a real eye opener as far as letting goes it describes the tactics employed which are chilling Lee and eerily resemble what we're seeing from the left\nOnce again today like some of the things that could happen in our Senate manipulation of the masses and the later bait and switch and gun Herman theme describes how these two men were in many ways very much alike in their goals for the world\nThe book reads well and I think you personally be interested it's also available as an audio book take care sir here so the fresh start to a new year\nFor you and your wife ten times and Ken thanks for the email I can promise you I Will read the book you know we can take a lot of things back to Wilson uh of course the beginning of what we would call modern day progressive that's but that's a\nWhole different subject on a whole different series of radio programs no doubt but I appreciate it and I'm Glad that you're enjoying the show\nAnd this one came to this one comes in from Mitchell Mitchell were says yesterday I accidentally saw the um on poor and company interview with Hillary Clinton accidentally mic shows you accidentally stumbled on that [laughter]\nI Love it she lays out her agenda and she and bill will be starting a Thirteen week tour across America letting people know\nWhat is wrong with Trump's America she just will not go away great email here's why\nThe final line she just will not go away mutual you're right she won't go away and here's why a large part because the media doesn't want her to go way remember that over eighty five percent\nOf those writing about hosting the show your view him as such as ... a month or and company production staff riders\nCamera operators boom Mike operators everyone behind the scenes directors et cetera voted for her\nThink about what they if you were going to go into this today we're going to continue this discussion today because ... and I I you know I I had planned on kind of trying to wrap it up and down on a representative skull east tend to piece today an op ed what you got it over at Fox News I Want to go through it with you it will probably take our\nBut it's a great exclamation point to\nPut on this week's program and I think it would it's it's just funny how stuff gets handed to you let me put it that way and that's what I Love about doing daily radio in live radio we we can go\nWherever we want to go and we just never run out of time in the sense that we can do it all over again tomorrow when we wake up and that's where we find ourselves to that but you are absolutely correct she just will not go away\nAnd that's the reason why the Barry media who creates the news and drives the narrative doesn't want her to go anyway the incendiary comments that she made this week about being impossible to be civil to Republicans\nI Will tell you today how damaging they are along with others\nBecause guess what else happened yesterday on my way through school Eric Holder made combat that we have to bring up today\nIn the context of the follow up by Steve ... and of course holders literal call for violence and that's what he did Alex playing it more\nAs we continue on in this radio program\nBut Michel your comment she just will not go away is key Eric Holder will not go away\nWho gives a flying satellite radio moment word about Eric Holder who\nNo one Eric Holder is re injecting himself as we talked about Colin Powell earlier there's earlier this week in to the forefront\nHe's trying to make himself visible anybody wonder why this scrawny little character of a goof ball goon left just believes he's got a shot at becoming president\nHence why you're seeing from him while you're hearing from him\nAnd make no mistake about this it is not a coincidence that the leaders of the Democrat Party\nAre encouraging this type of rhetoric these calls to violence against their political opponents oh but wait the I don't I don't remember oh I don't know I haven't heard Joe Biden come out and say attack anybody were ... they don't have to the mere fact that\nThey're silent condones what their colleagues are saying and make no mistake about this American gun owner armed American if you were talking about\nWe're going to have a great program so they have a lot of things together for you as we always do but this is a fascinating topic it's a frightening topic and unfortunately it is high time\nIt the discuss why because the left requires us to discuss it\nBy an individual who tried to wipe out an entire baseball diamond filled with Republicans in large measure because of the ... being perpetrated by Brock Obama's dogs just call them leftovers\nHillary Clinton's and the rest\nWe were informed by letter writer just earlier won't go away by ... they will not go away and they won't for good reason so that the ... knows a little bit about this because of the rhetoric coming from the left he and dozens others\n\nWere the attempt ... were the were the target of an assassin a political his job by a leftist lunatic\nIn Virginia on the baseball diamond that the Steve ... we've got a little bit to say about that\nOh you know what maybe I should let me tell you quickly what Trump said I don't want to have to circle back\nLet me tell you a little bit about what Trump said about these disgusting comments from Eric with holder here's what Trump said take a listen to Fox and friends this morning let me play a clip it was just Donald Trump earlier this morning on Fox and friends when he was asked about hold her state and here's what you had to say let's go\nTo care for what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's wearing a disgusting shape and found him back for him to make a statement like that is a very dangerous statement\nBy that Donald Trump telling you he'd better be careful what he's wishing for\nAnd that's great advice for all of these Democrats Maxine Waters and every single one of the top that are not decrying the statements and not think about this note top Democrat\nNone of them not a Bernie Sanders he's an independent you get to pass right not a Bernie Sanders no one\nNo Hillary Clinton no in fact she's making the statement I'm Sorry I forgot about that sorry about that slipped my mind I I Do apologize Bill Clinton Brock Obama Michelle Obama\nSilent Durban silent pillows he pleads waters please\nThey're silent they're complicit\nThey better be careful what they wish for\n\nPretty profound words from the president of the United states now see I I got myself a little bit longer than I wanted to hear but that's okay because you're going to go to Steve school least when we come back and talk a little bit about this and while I Do that I Want you to go back and think because I'm going to remind you obviously\nAbout what we talked about earlier in the week and we're talking about Charles Sumner\nAnd the ... the painting of Charleston think about what we're getting ready to talk about when you hear me discuss these ... words and keep it in the context of where we weren't Eighteen fifty six keep it in the context of the things we talked about together this week this is very important stuff\nI'm going to make some predictions for you before the show is over a lot of people were to Chicken Little to do
