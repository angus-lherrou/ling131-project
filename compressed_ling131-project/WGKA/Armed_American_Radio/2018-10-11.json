what is right that the on parallel liberty that we have\nBecause they incorporated in the constitution checks and balances\nAnd other limitations on government that would ensure our liberty because man is entitled to liberty and an animal rights are citing he was created in God's image they burned more laid back so\nI mean majority of our founders are Christians contrary to history they're just

that's a hobby isn't it but it's true isn't it\nHillary Clinton is a two time loser big capital L still can't get over the fact she's not president I bet she walks right can you imagine what goes on behind closed doors in her house how angry she must be\nWhy am I saying that yesterday's program was fascinating I I Know you enjoyed it because I got a number of emails\n\nBut we talked a little bit about yesterday some things from the Senate the cold civil war\nThese ... these are fascinating topics to talk about I find them utterly fascinating and then of course we're talking about may twenty second Eighteen fifty six the gaining of Senator Charles Sumner that most history professors probably don't teach any more you got to kind of ask if you want to learn about something like that\nAnd is that that that was from the U.S Senate page a little bit of history lesson the crime against Kansas of course what set that up\nAnd that was the the the talk or the one hundred and twelve pages long\nAddress by Charles some there when he rose to speak on may nineteenth Eighteen fifty six he directed this Ira to individuals one relative of one of the individuals that he directed his higher at\nWas a member of the house of representatives came into the Senate chamber beat him nearly to death with a cane in the U.S Senate\nThe rhetoric today is so bad particularly coming from the left\nIt comes from everywhere if you get out on the Twitter and all these goofy social you know social forums you that you can go on to any more you know today's day and age\nSocial media which is doing terrible damage by the way the psyche of the country I recommend if you can live without that stuff if you don't have it for a business purpose just get away from it go live your life get off that stuff it's unnecessary Twitter is not life\nPorters wear a bunch of people with a lot of time on their hands go up again for business I have to have it for business it's it's a great forum for business in reaching people in this type of stuff but if it's if you don't need it for business you can get away from it\nYou don't need it you don't need it\nBut you use social forums are there people are just so angry in these things getting back to the rhetoric being so bad let me before I get into all this let me start with this\nEvery thing of the research for this program today began at about quarter to two in the morning\nI have four teen different areas to go to a day that I'm going to kind of tie together I I Will tell you all fourteen of them I've just for the sake of telling you how it came together today it began at quarter to two in the morning eastern time\nQuarter to eleven at night Pacific time\nWhen I was awake sadly by fall asleep on early so I slept kind of hard woke up early middle of the night and started reading some new study on the you know start looking perusing with it and it just started falling into my lap\nToday's research that's why I was just uncanny is where I began sending some of these things to myself for further follow up later in the morning after I got some more sleep\nBut started coming to me in the middle of the night as I was perusing stories on the news the news right we talked yesterday about what's the news the news sites that I went to when I go to a number of them\nBut talking about rhetoric and it being so bad today\n\nRand Paul is talking about\nHe's afraid they're going to be an assassination and I can promise you Rand Paul is not worried about it conservative assassinating a liberal or the other way around he's worried about the radical unhinged unglued left\nWho are taking their what I don't like to use the term that you know the dog whistle garbage because it's not a dog whistle when Maxine Waters stands up and tells fellow Democrats and unhinged lunatics\nTo hassle Republicans everywhere they find them\nIncluding in front of their homes that's not a dog whistle you know anything about a dog whistle you can't hear it\nOnly dogs can here to meant to be some type of silent clues to those who pick up on things put the radical on his left out\nThey don't worry about that they come right out and say at Maxine Waters comes to mind but the rhetoric is so bad Rand Paul is very concerned about that few minutes his wife sleeps with a loaded firearm\nAs well she should as well he should\n\nYesterday from the Senate page itself\nThe resulting beating galvanized the nation and haste and civil war\nThink about that\nThe painting of Senator Charles Sumner Eighteen fifty six may twenty second from the Senate own page\nNation suffering from the breakdown of reason discourse that this event symbolize tumbled onward toward the catastrophe of civil war\nLet's focus on the breakdown of reason discourse that this event symbolized the event be the beating by Cain of Senator Charles Sumner by an unhinged Democrat\nThat the events\nThat symbolized in Eighteen fifty six the breakdown of reason discourse\n\nMcCotter yesterday reminded us in no uncertain terms that history may very well look back and see Steve skull lease as our modern day Charles Sumner\n\nTo be exact he said if they do not meaning if the left cannot begin answering fourth lawlessness\nWhich is creating the political divide in this country and deepening are cold civil war he called it\nThe better come up devise he said an answer soon and I quote now if they do one day historians will record the violent left had turned Steve school east into our Charles Sumner well there's a difference here\nSteve Sebelius was not attacked\nBy a fellow elected official was attacked by an unhinged leftist wacko trying to murder as many Republicans at a ball field that he could\nThe rhetoric heated rhetoric that we were talking about yesterday\nIs doing tremendous damage to the country and of course it is coming from the radical unhinged left I e Maxine Waters Maxine Waters is a ... he's a nut job he's got screws loose I don't know who votes for these people I don't\nWho who walks into a what what normal intelligent honest individual walked into a voting booth and pull the lever for Maxine Waters\n\nI don't get it [laughter] dies it's hard for me to wrap my head around that quite frankly maybe it's not for you I don't know but we have to look at where she's from to write\nA bunch of goof falls out there in the Gulf today Maxine Waters but the rhetoric coming from the left so what's the first thing I see a quarter to two in the morning\nHillary Clinton is the headline Democrat cannot be civil with Republicans anymore now I don't care what you think about Hillary Clinton you know what I think about Hillary Clinton\nA man who want to kill went to the ball field to kill as many Republican members of the house that he could\n\nHere's what Steve school we set seriously Hillary in a tweet seriously Hillary\nAnd of course he linked to a CNN politics quote of hers you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\nMitch McConnell yesterday took to the Senate floor and use Clinton's remarks\nTo remind America and the Democrats in that chamber and anyone else who cares to watch and listen\nWhat Hillary Clinton said here's what he said on the floor of the Senate she told CNN exactly how she views millions of Americans who hold different political views than her own\nNo peace until they get their way more of these unhinged tactics apparently these are the less rallying cry\nWhen you already knew that\nWe have been talking about the danger the threat\nOf the radical left on this program since the daily defenses inception and on the monster gas for ten years now in ten years we have discussed this type of behavior from an idiot allergy\nThat hates our right to bear arms we've seen this as gun owners for years apparently this is new to people like McConnell when a gun owner like you were I\nHere's Hillary Clinton call was deplorable we know exactly what she means we know she hates us\n\nWhen we hear Brock Obama say we cling to our guns in our Bible we know exactly what he me\n\nMeanwhile for a large part of America these comments or brushed off\n\nBut I Want to take you back to the Senate dot Gov Web site again in its history minute pages the painting of Senator Charles Sumner\n\nThe nation suffering from the breakdown of reason
