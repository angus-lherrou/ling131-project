for\nThe issue um but the tech method is the news report um the power companies in the end it\nDown and then of course yeah military the military I Want to point to solve their military is standing by and ready of course I go on air force base to home of first special forces\nI Know a number of their units are assembled and ready to go they moved to higher ground or to get out of harm's way that phone aircraft out all day will be ready and there'll be allowed and military support to this this will be similar\nTo what we saw mobilized in the Carolinas I Do believe will have a huge military presidents we've already got well over two thousand for the Army National guardsmen that have been mobilized\nA state troopers are all had nor has\nYeah and I saw big tomboy a little while ago I walked outside of the ... leaving from the airport ah with ah what looked like power trucks they must have staged over here somewhere close by and they were headed out going the journal direction but there you go okay now um\nAnd again our thoughts and prayers go to all those folks ah we've got a situation this is now and we spoke briefly about this and I just wanted mentioned in passing a we're no the a chief here of the war in Afghanistan as of October seventh ... this year\nThat correct\nHoller how long are we going to hear here\nWell here's the deal\nCount man in those ah other a pair of ... um that they harbor and healthier and collaborate with\nA can move freely about the country you know they they have made it yeah you know ungoverned space right um the United states who coalition forces and and the allies\nWe are still I Would say somewhat restricted in certain bases by which we can operate so you you have a geography advantage for the Taliban and\nUm we are back in negotiations with the Taliban What we're doing there with them I don't know what we're offering them I don't know I think I Know but I I Can't be sure but nonetheless um until\nUh the Afghan forces are getting you know handle things on their own um and step up and in a much more robust way like the Iraqis did um we're going to go in the nineteenth ear and the twentieth year that you know where it is\nNow Nikki Haley of course was the best serves the United nations and she turned her resignation apparently she told the president's six months ago she was going to resign and so it's no big surprise for the\nJob with health condition that one of the conditions I think are the two years didn't uh-huh\nAnd um so she she didn't tell him a couple of months ago that as a reminder but furthermore um she came to her resignation\n[noise] about a week and a half ago and uh she gave it to Trump the trunk old he was the only one that she told him he held it because we were slack in the middle of the whole cabinet All right so it was coordinated that we've come out yesterday\nNow where his name to um that had been revealed that are on the shortlist so far and one is breaking\nNow the U.S ambassador to Germany was stuck in a long long time to get confirmed through the Senate um I wouldn't leave him where he is ... it took so long they have a\nUm ... and ... that are shipped all failed for Germany and he had been there all that long although he was you know a deputy secretary to the un and for eight years under the Bush administration right [noise]\nBut at this point um I Believe that he really needs to stay where he is because remember we've got Europe\nEspecially Germany um\nAnd that is not necessarily falling in cadence swear the doctrine on Iran right and uh so I think he\nShould stay there certainly to leave that charge the other one is Dina Powell I'm not a fan of being a Powell [noise] um\nHe ... you know a Republican or at least she's registered can be okay but he was brought in a under a comic master and he came from Goldman Sachs I think she's going back to Goldman Sachs\nShe got very good ties to get that believe that she was actually either born lived in a gift for quite some time if he speaks fluent Arabic um but uh he emigrated to the United states from from Egypt\nBut she's gotten very ties to the ... too [laughter] yeah um [noise] so I Would\nI Would kind of made me put her in a pencil maybe on a less I Would try very ... different tactic if if I was the Trump Administration on who he candidate to replace\nNikki Haley in fact I Would work pretty hard to make it a woman that we can you know kind of a new in town can count on neutralize this war on women the Democrat says yes and I would take somebody out of a congressional seat in order to possibly open it up to the Republicans\nAre I'd like to hold that thought so should be right back with more rigid you Simon from founders cone dot com and we're going to talk about uh some other things and I'll give you a little cheese on and how about the New York times you're voting to\nTurkey blames the Saudis were killed and chopped up\nBody inside\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations in one cell gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps\nBut here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here

people say oh colluding what game is Baker's testimony was\nUm [noise] but I ... in this point I think that Trump is\nWaiting Rosen staying where he is and the reason they end up doing is because the whole ball or investigation um is about to come to a close some of the cases obviously have been handed off in two other court a as we know it did with the Manafort ill\nAnd uh he mall or even let
