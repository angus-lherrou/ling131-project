cell phone because the New York times is reporting that both China and Russia had been listening to Trump's cell phone\nCorrect and that is not coming from um just something that the New York times concocted but\nApparently\nWe got several within the CIA that um\nAre voicing these concerns a and over to OD and I coat that have gotten up to the White House and said hey now the reason it apparently is because apparently some of these offered in the CIA operatives are learning about\nCertain tattered among rogue people out of China and Russia that a centrally no more than they should\nUm about certain things because of communication that Trump has on his cell phone so they they voice their concerns through the rank and file of their own agencies and then it got to OD and I coat and from there\nIs um apparently gotten into the presidential daily brief the now the way the New York times ... jump right the isn't to give up the phone or you know to change his phone down to one more secure we all know about all that far yet but\nNonetheless there has been and is apparently current condition where China and Russia have some kind of access to jump cell phone\nNow every time he treats that's from a cell phone right we don't know that okay because it was from a cell phone I can understand where that will be coming into play I don't know if maybe she was\nSaying boy yeah we we don't know ... hour in either that or some\nOther kind of tablet um we don't\nKnow what is it Brock Obama who had his cell phone taken away from the same reason\n[noise] [noise] I don't

was cooked up to you know\n... sympathy for Democrats I agree and and this election season I I agree is my guest smell something around here\nAnd so doesn't that just about everybody else that's out there because even some of their pals and the mainstream media are saying that they believe that strong possibility that this has been contrived to uh take the pressure off if you will above the caravans which we're going to get into in a minute\nAnd also all the all the little things that have come forward like a hundred pages that have been released about\nThe Democrat down here uh Andrew Gillum and the FBI was investigating him when he said there is no investigation they never were investigating me but they were ... they were doing whatever but he lied and then they caught him at him
