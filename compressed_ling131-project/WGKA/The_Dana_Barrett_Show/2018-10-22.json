it's up let's\nUp our little discussion we were having above the nuclear arms treaty with Russia now we're talking about the intermediate range nuclear forces treat short short and intermediate millennium and it was negotiated by then president\nI don't know Reagan Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Nineteen eighty seven which required elimination of land based short range and intermediate range nuclear and conventional\nMissiles by both countries now word is China's\nNot involved in this right no okay so somehow some way somebody in Russia's telling us that I'm\nA ... let's see let me go here Trump should the United states will develop their weapons in West Russia and China agreed to a halt development on what they're doing because according to Russia China is doing the very thing that uh we're accusing Russia of doing\nWell they may be developing them that they don't have them deployed on ground based um location point in Europe right [laughter] so\n... you know this is a typical tactic that Russia injecting you know something that doesn't need to be there because China is not a party to that at\nAll I'm now a this would\nEssentially the pullout and again this is this is really just discussion it's an assertive discussions that I'm ... and there's going to have with Moscow um that we would renegotiate because Russia is clearly in violation\nAnd they keep saying they're they're not in violation\nSo they want to muddy the water ... and um that is part and parcel of of why the United states and having a discussion with um Moscow to start with this coming week\nNow let's talk about this caravan 'cause everybody's really really concerned about this curve as is coming up\nUh out of a Central America now they believe that uh it started out with Honduran natives and then when it got to Guatemala picked up some more folks\nAnd then somewhere along the line has gone from a thousand of two thousand four thousand and now we're hearing it's at least five thousand strong and some of the element has crossed into Mexico already they jumped the border\nOr somehow or another but the rest of them are pretty much intact and they're starting to scatter\nOut I'm as they continue to move along the Mexican border any idea where you think they're headed\nWhere they're headed they're headed to the United states\nBut are they headed in one particular location or are they going to spread it out and\nDo that no I mean they wouldn't do that but\nI understand something here um the United states\nAnd this happened last week with the Mike I'm ... I went to Mexico and said okay here's here's what we're going to try and do the here so there's all these stipulations that have happened and the stipulation include\nThat if you are part of this caravan and you need some kind of a asylum then these are the rules in order for you to be in the ... I'm a filing for asylum if you do not\nComply with the process\nThan anything that you do once you get to either the United states or whatever it will be the gated because we we've given you the wrong\nSo they're already seeing themselves in the foot the other thing is it the Mexico was called in the United nations that hey oh we're going to need some help with this\nAnd these are the things that we need and that included um if you will tend to put how these people mhm of with Mexico obviously you know they're not\nPhysically prepared to to deal with this and that that part I understand I'm so they need some humanitarian stuff\nTo be delivered to Mexico from the United nations which also includes personnel to help Mexico ... these um\nUh application if you will right and\nWhat not and that would also include some humanitarian\nProvisions meaning food or medicine or water or whatever else if they were these people go into these can't location so um the United states with Mexico worked out and build some Mexico has a\n... it's more equipped to deal with it um then having them come through to any in the United states is that the next ... they're not coming here that's just where we are they're not ... here and\nI'm now some of them you know kinda scored out one end because they you know they they could get Charlotte ... that's a different matter but most of the most part\nIt ain't going to happen now\nUm I Would also say that\nAh when it comes to this caravan we are watching very closely who's behind a lot of this coordination right\nAnd um Mexico has deployed their military I'm In order to stop wherever they can at their border with Guatemala though I mean Mexico has clearly stepped up and that's because we clicked\nJust amazing pressure on Mexico and Mexico has to make these for requests of their neighboring nations because they're not ... I mean Guatemala and El Salvador Honduras or not our neighbors that Mexico is\nAnd then the United nations so or essentially teaching Mexico and for thing Mexico too you know come into some kind of human\nAnd we have a question we have a question for male he said that um there's a report that there are ISIS fighters and disturbing\nI heard that um but I heard one and I heard or a hundred American out\n... and ... it came from somebody from official in Guatemala let that official has not or what he said has not been substantiated but because he some kind of special in Guatemala [noise] um he made that announcement\nWide well hold that thought and we'll be right back with more rigid nice I'm from found a showdown Tom we are talking about that Tom words that everybody's got their eyes on and um I can tell you that the\nCross this would be the international red\nIs already set up some moved tent\nAre seeking refuge right now so that's the latest on\nHere to visit because it's one\n\nPresents Cathy Lou candid real estate agent now in the living room you see this beautiful day window it's energy efficient and let's see enough natural line and we'll also let's see when you leave it unlocked and he'll still your laptop and slap screen TV [laughter] I Know who wants to see the kitchen\nIt's hard to know all this comes renting a home or apartment that's one of the guy go insurance agency makes getting covered for personal property loss and damage quick and easy ... dot com and see how affordable renters insurance can be\nThis is Michael Medvedev here with my saw from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe costs of many Medicare plans are decreasing us here so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate\nHealth markets offers a free service with access\nTo thousands and Medicare plans plans I can eliminate you're out of pocket costs plans with zero dollar premiums and even plans I pay you back\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind with so many new option it can be confusing you can get objective help to find a planet may cost less than an cover more with lower co pay more choice of like dental vision and prescription drug coverage\nAnd the freedom to see the doctors and you don't miss out on savings you deserve our help markets Medicare assistance is free\n... comes I'm truly no state promise or nation is prepared for situation like this where the uh uh all the people on them all all the or he's talking about ISIS there is no ... province our nation prepared for situation like this talking about ISIS or Taliban\nMeticulously and it you know what we have here isn't surgeon and I might be a little hyperbolic and using that term but I don't believe so\nUm [noise] you know you a sense like Mexico that has declared really a state of emergency mhm because they've deployed their military and they deployed there a state police into these locations they got um a plane and flew 'em in there\nThey also dropped humanitarian stuff to these people um so I mean we we have a state of emergency in Mexico I'm\n... and and I think Mexico is necessarily caught off guard so the United states had to go in there and say this is what you need to do and your name made to be on not the United states is happening in Mexico um and let's not forget these people need asylum out of their country they're out\nWhere did you hear this the New York times put out of an article and it's just the Democrats are George ... one micro caravans just five Republican claims the answer's no and then um the person to protect ourselves said this helps Trump and the ... the wind a world where Charles want to help Trump\n\nAgain\nI'm throws his name is not\nOn it because he fun but you know the ... the top tier group and then those groups are the ones that get the money and handed out so ultimately he's a Mack Daddy as the bank\nMhm yeah well this this person is putting some out there which again the niche just conjecture on their part so yeah and the New York giants without the article there they were good arguments as it's not it's not ...\nYeah or whatever you know and I would not believe anything they ever posted and I mean we\nWe blame sorrow probably for things that he doesn't need to get blamed for but in this in this case you know let's not forget his financial model yeah he ... he passes out the money to designated organization a thorough but for Heidi and then those designated organization pass out the money or wherever it wants to go\nRattles or we're running out of time so what are you writing about today\nUh I I may be if I get some time here I may be doing the thing where uh Iran is flying a weapon\nParsons eleven on all ... we didn't talk about that but the GPS parts that they're going to help the U.S has blood as their target ship already we'll talk do tomorrow morning same time soon venture\n...

I I stood there for a second watching the TV it's over here over my shoulder and a kitchen in the break room I stood there and I looked at the television I said my God this guy looks and the mannerisms I said this guy looks just like Rocco bomb a junior on steroids\nWell he he saw something that worked for two election cycles that worked or rather well for something that is\nA solemn someone that he's code saying quote from or you know he's a he's a ... and the progress of this as social ...\nA so she tried to replicate that he doesn't have rock Obama's apparatus and he doesn't have brought Obama executive at either\nUm Bible was excellent at the mall and then he could he could make a make or ... percent of uh so we're uh this guy is a a a little less polished Brock Obama was a huge you know working on it all is on the plan\nIs working on now the other thing you talked about there were several things she said that as soon as I can start doing some fact checking I found that wasn't true I'm run just send us a talked about you know six years in taxes and being increased and this that and the other and Gillum um you know and he asked them questions about raising taxes in Gillum never gave them an answer\nAnd then he ... he says well you know we have the most dynamic most progressive and we are the fastest growing city this that and you know I started to look at that I couldn't even find Tallahassee\nAs head of the fastest growing cities in the country I couldn't even find him on the top one hundred list couldn't even find them\nWell and and this is what progress was do we been talking for the about this for over Fifteen Years\nUm they will they will create a narrative and and say whatever they want to say tempting you to go out in fact ... and turn them down but it's already been said mhm and and for people who share it and don't bother to fact check it becomes a reality\nSo here's a guy who is claiming a color has he was a of a fast moving we're going to be the next ... San Francisco ... when it comes to progress of creating jobs this and that the other well\nNo I did find I did find this out Frank I found out that the survey that he talked about was an internal survey in Tallahassee had nothing to do with national or statewide\n... your ... vote quicker than the ... the most beautiful person in the room\nYeah and when it came to the the cities in Florida there were the fastest growing and the most uh you know dynamic in terms of our economy Tallahassee wasn't even in the top ten\nAnd Taylor has got its own unique set of problems or if you've ever spent any time ago I have the the parents or you didn't do a lot of fixing anything or as a matter of fact he did a lot of complicated things from Tallahassee especially the local economy\nWell here or you know and here's a big deal\nAbout six years in a row the taxes went up when he started out as a counselor and I guess you'd call it a ... but when you started I was at six or six years in a row the taxes have gone up there\nAnd and there you go on and he doesn't have a problem raising taxes if you look at his platform it's all about that\nSo and he's only going to charge the top three percent\nOf course you know and they're yeah right that's what he said then we hear that before\nYeah we did we did was went out and bought him a\nLot of what happened everybody ended up taking gas\nYep yep and then he talked about health care and he talked about how health care prices were so out of touch and how the Republicans had a a a cause the price of June to grow up in this that and the other and I actually found the stats from\nThe the um the medical uh department in the state of Florida deport for the state department at all\nWhere since Obama cares mandate was read removed and is no longer requirement that you must have Obamacare that their premiums and the general insurance industry on health insurance have actually gone down\nOf course they have they've gone across the board across the country it's because of Obamacare was the most expensive tax with ever took place in in the history of the United states\nYeah and this guy this guy had the audacity to say well everything has gone up and as we go to the Republicans I have NO PLAN\nThat's because progressive say whatever they want it it's like saying go go ahead and and and make that mistake or or execute the transgression and ask for forgiveness later\nYou know that that's what they do they see what ever they want to say that's beneficial at the time it doesn't matter if the facts given the way\nWell I'm Glad you said that let me tell you something near\nThis election is not it's\nNot simply about Republicans versus Democrats it's much bigger than that it's really about white versus wrong it's about free markets versus socialism\nIt's about due process versus mob rule it's about civility versus violence and it's about good versus evil\nNo and then people need to be clear eyed about those two you have somebody who is who is a\nHe's a socialist\nHe's he's just a social ... a woman out of San Francisco\nAnd and they're making inroads here because they have money to be able to manipulate the narrative the they're they're seeing warming Fox News when they get and they started dismantling the capitalist system and imposing a socialist democratic system that's what they want to do\nAnd they're doing it incrementally they've been trying to do this and the turn of the twentieth century and they have been succeeding so this is a line in the sand for us it anybody who enjoys freedom who enjoys capitalism self government self representation\nAnd self responsibility we have to make a point says elections title hold that thought and so soon we come back we'll talk a little bit more was so vital by the way my health insurance went down\nMy neighbors health insurance went down most of the people I Know their health insurance went down because this is the fact that we're not locked into that deals as some of these other people are so Sam tell me who you're with everybody this is the cast members is you get to six am here tonight there'll be talked about on this radio\nStation is

of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and save money\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind enrollment\nIn the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options

like you see coming out of California in Dianne Feinstein Chuck Schumer of New York mhm\nUh or or your woman in Tallahassee for that matter of a much lower level you have people trying to pick winners and losers in an artificially leveling the playing field for everybody and that's what capitalism suffers and\nYou must let people fail in capitalism in order for for the markets that actually thrive mhm if you're always constantly trying to bail someone out you're creating an artificial field or if you're\nIf you're covering the herd down to just the few who are privileged like in the media not as an issue when you when you look at the media\nTake a look at what we have to do every time we talk about an issue map yeah you've got you've got the big stations including CNN and MSNBC\nJust something that a narrow because they're controlled by an ideological set your right and then you have people who throw the Richard the machine like one America news at Fox and and programs like this is talk radio you know ... that's because of the ownership is diverse there\nYeah yeah and they understand that there were about America we are not about an individual source or reason or whatnot because this program is all about America\nWell when you talk about capitalism you can put in the equation Martin ... and put the word on the other side of opportunity where when you talk about socialism or government control you're talking about the lack of opportunity because the artificial playing field doesn't give opportunity to all\nWell let's do this right so you can get everything in
