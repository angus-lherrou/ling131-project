will Democrats get power back in the house and what about the Senate to the gym pig actually gain seats two three four several current democratic seats are in the spotlight\nDoes in North Dakota Indiana Florida but nothing more than Missouri as incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill wants to hang on to her seat against her very able challenger Missouri's attorney general Josh Hawley my colleague Larry Elder spoke with James O'Keefe of project Barrett tossed\nAside keeps investigative team do deep inside the McCaskill campaign\nWe've got the news because Claire McCaskill shut off responded to our hidden camera destination she attacked a video of course she made a false statement in this state that she put out a she said that the Republican candidate for Senator John Ali\nHad brought you normally embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct I had nothing to do with Josh ... never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved with the investigation\nAnd just to your listeners know our investigation McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that her and McCaskill on about his policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that other staffers talked about banning semi automatic rifles and mechanical herself was caught on camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her saying that they would be a gun Dan of some type so they canceled out just respond on local news in Missouri\nThey are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not and um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only the the Stanford talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they talk about handguns\nClara herself talks about um when she gets into this and that she'll vote with so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there is a red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are moderate they're not ... they're they're they're moderate the pro life pro gun Democrats still thing in Missouri on paying these like steak so what is investigating exposures is that in order to get elected\nIn order to get elected you have to lie to the people and that's what all staffers are saying he's saying the moderates we'll just have to get over being lied to very devastating very powerful\nI mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done because it involves a sitting US Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling or wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill's response James okay\nWell it is some startling [noise] hey Josh how I Would be part of fraudulently in betting on me and my campaign nice the attorney general of the famous airy he's supposed to be going after fraud\nNot participating in it [laughter] so um there was nothing there I've been very uptight about all my position I've made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment which really telling about that\nIs how far they're willing to go too far in that time they in my campaign\n[noise] well first of all it does I mean it's an old faith lie categorically unequivocally falls\nJosh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I'd never met him and she didn't live on local TV in Missouri Larry what's gonna happen next to this other than a candidate John always say that he's not doing it\nShe's gonna have to respond to that so I think we're we're achieving our goal of holding people accountable and I think that she's in a lose lose situation\nBut hurricane that rabbit he's in the Florida Panhandle northward from the Gulf was horribly

veteran himself\nBut get right down to it the danger zone has receded according to I'm writing a real clear politics story here the congressional leadership fund has seen see six districts will hurt Andy Barr my boss Rodney Davis Brian mess John Katko receipt and to save comfortable territory\nIf it's we're down to twenty to thirty districts that are competitive and they sound pretty optimistic it on hold the house or Mike Gallagher what do you think\nWell this is anecdotal but certainly in the Republican Party ... as we have around my district and our bases cap and we've seen in a surge in volunteers coming in people coming in that aren't necessarily party faithful to pick up signs and ask\nWhat can I Do to help so I Do sense a slight momentum shift I've always thought this was going to be a knife edge when we talk about control of the house you know five seats one way or the other\n... but also my understanding is that our we have real opportunities to pick up some seats from Democrats in Minnesota and that the Democrats are pulling out of a couple of states that look it'd be treading in our direction so again we got to run through the tape\nThis is you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't take anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down\nThe candidate quality and sort of the twenty to thirty states that we are talking about here\n[laughter] sorry let me talk to you about some defense issues first of all the F twenty twos at ten dull a it's a murky picture or I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt that that but maybe we did get hurt that that may be a danger to stealth technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment at why by the way do we keep at twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell you try to read through this and I'm looking forward to being back in session and November So we can at him hard questions of aid figure out what exactly happened\nIt seems like Seventeen twenty Jews are damaged I think ten of those are cats and the storm rated hangar but no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus miles per hour winds and seven of the seven of the Seventeen when Lester rated hangers\nI think it's important to note that no one thought this would be a four to five little earth in forty eight hours prior I'm not trying to make excuses for the military here um but the planes are based in those so that they can have access to the training range of of the Gulf of Mexico no one would want a bunch of that twenty two going into super cruise over Kansas is too disturbing to the local community\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country so as best I can tell him talking to officials plug it experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be your air but the problem here is the skin\nOn the plane there's a lot of radar absorbent material ram involved and the repairing and replacing it'd be very expensive\nAnd my understanding of the initial site survey suggests that the air frame appear to be okay\nSo we believe we can get most of them back on track to repairing the skins um will be a very expensive proposition finally I just stay out of your question why were so many their ground this goes back\nReally to the Obama administration decision to hold the program a two thousand nine factory gates was the ultimate decided that decision and the decision to cut back on the air force personnel and train maintain ers and funds for reading it so we had to answer the reason that the question that so many were on the ground and the first place\nWith their engines pulled it because of the lack of spare parts and a lack\nOf trained people George ... president enjoying worthy job campaign when candidates invulnerable critical house and Senate races in Ohio he took time to praise the work of some of America's political and military heroes who I Am from the state so what is the civil war general Ulysses Grant was preceded by the mention of grants number one\nGeneral Robert ... blurry older shows on media misused of soundbites to paint Trump as a racist\nTrump is being criticized for praising General Robert we said\nThey gave us a great president who has it been properly recognized OK William McKinley he has not been properly records it also gave you [noise]\nHave\nGeneral [noise] who is incredible he drank a little bit too much you know what I'm Talking about [noise] so Robert\n... was a great general can you hear that he says so Robert ... what a great general [noise] still Robert Daly was a great general change like that [noise]\nAnd [noise] Abraham Lincoln develop a phobia\nHe couldn't be Robert Daly he was going crazy I don't know if you know the answer but Robert Daly was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln jama reason I can beat Robert Daly\nAnd one day it was looking really bad and you just said you\nHardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem [noise]\nI said I don't get what probably as you guys aren't women [noise]\nAnd his name was grant general [noise]\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared its intelligence Turkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe a video of him from inside the conflict showing who did what any excess in Asia you know they've got they've got the goods\nIf they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence ... who often work very closely with the Turks\nThen that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on us\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nRight now under the impact that for example the war in Yemen this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses who's\nJordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America trying to confront the who these who are sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome as being a necessary course correction in the middle east\nUh I'm not sure that has any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish than his whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a ... operator before the Saudis had begun to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as the succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nCan therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it as an exotic story and reads like a trailer I'm Jamal ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long David Kirkpatrick\nYeah I think we're trying to say before where it's going to hit the crown prince is with elite opinion you know the wall street and Silicon Valley or he's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and they're no out to help diversify the Saudi economy\nHe's going to find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort and that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia over the not too long term has got some real issues in terms of being able to support their economy on their oil revenue\nListen to the entire interview with New York times reporter David Kirkpatrick on town all review dot com coming up\nLast Monday I got closer I Can't learn that to

avoiding campus culture we've seen this in a shocking reality at UC Berkeley clermont colleges especially Middlebury College where Charles Murray was wrapped up on a campus conservative and vices basically well look out\nFor the most recent example it was a university and invited to speak of cliche that story is a graduate of Rutgers is now a counterterrorism expert she was invited to speak by her alma mater but before she was this big band brought bleep just invited us to my colleague Dennis prayers for at least on his show [noise]\nSo you were about to speak after DOMA monitor Rutgers University while was the topic supposed to be\nAll the schools I commend it over a year ago the school recommended radicalism on college campuses uh before this fiasco and it started with ... a calculation and all of that I uh basically brought in just about freedom of speech on campus listening to other how far can far\nNot going out with and the hashtags and find comfort but actually building that dialogue on campus if I had they quickly or a shirt I Would say about freedom of speech ironically\nWhen we what was the date of your schedule speech\nLast Monday I got a call from the vice chancellor alerting ... to the fact that there is a petition and to turn by some students it wants to start if that's a ironically the student is the head of the college ... he worked on Bernie Sanders' campaign and he is also\nOn the Muslim public relations are going to be the ... are they on campus a vice chair of hope that he met with the students\nAnd only a handful showed up we've got to me to be honest I don't understand their grievance against you but they feel injured\nAnd I have to be sensitive to that now\nI I I mean to assimilate that a few students felt injured and she cancelled your speech\nBased on base with allegations that in the\nFall of partition a quote I mean I I was blown away by this because as you know me while I Am of Iranian descent and have always taken such a new one position with regard to differentiating\nBetween Muslim people on the news or the hijacking the will of Islam in political Islam and extremism\nPastor Andrew Brunson has God given love for the people who've turkey were approximately eighty percent of the population identifies says Muslim but there's a rich Christian History in that region vis is one of the two locations where the apostle Paul preach the gospel\nRuns and lived administered in Turkey for Twenty years suddenly he and his wife Noreen were arrested she was released Thirteen Days later\nHe was charged with espionage in prison for two years ... founder and chairman of liberty council has followed this case closely he joined by program on WNBA in Washington DC\nMaybe you could tell folks have this terrible injustice ever got started with this subtle American pastor and Christian\nWell it's certainly good to have this news and we were Joyce with pasture Brunson and the family and we really want to thank the Trump Administration under President Donald Trump\nOr they could smell Eighteen American hostages from hostile countries have now been released including from North Korea and now you have this from turkey so there is an amazing effort to bring our American citizens home that are being held hostage from around these different parts of the world you know twenty three years\nPastor Brunson and his wife and three children have worked in Turkey without any incident at all they passed or the church in is near turkey called is near resurrection church he actually was applying for residency and turkey before his arrest and he was arrested\nYears ago October seven twenty sixteen he has actually been charged eventually this year in April a with membership in an armed terrorist organization\nThey issued an indictment that was sixty two pages but it only had unknown and discredited so called secret witnesses he could've spent thirty five years in prison in April of this year April sixteen\nIs when there was a trial that began it was the first day of his trial it was actually attended by North Carolina Senator Tom tell us and the U.S ambassador at large for international religious freedom San Brownback\nAnd of course faster Brunson is a U.S citizen he lived in uh North Carolina he went to a church in ... North Carolina and had been passed soon as I said there for twenty three years in Turkey wanting to have permanent status and that's what he was applying for\nAnd then out of the blue came this allegation that he was part of a\nMembership of an armed terrorist organization which is absolutely do because\nHe has been in prison for two years and from April sixteen\nUntil last friday the hearing had been kicked down the road four times the last most are scheduled to hearing believe it or not amazingly was last\nFriday October twelve that was when the fourth\nA rescheduled hearing was and it was on that day or October twelve that it was announced that he was going to be released instead of going to trial so he is now back in the United states and uh we rejoiced with them but I think you know certainly for for this faster\nIt's great news that he's free no question he lost a lot of weight\nHe had been transferred from a very bad prison to home arrest because of his declining health he lost about fifty plus pounds or so in prison\nUm and we rejoiced with him being able to be released but you also have to understand why was he there for twenty three years what did he want to ultimately have permanent status as a U.S citizen and turkey just because he loved the Turkish people and he was a pastor is a pastor\nAnd while he has been released and he's back home and we rejoiced with him understand that his ministry is now no longer going to be able to take him back to turkey if he goes back to turkey he wouldn't be arrested again so his ministry that he has dedicated his life and his family for for twenty three years\nHas come to an end in Turkey we just pray that God will open up some additional new doors that maybe he doesn't even even really understand at this point in time because he and his family have been so faithful to share the gospel to people in Turkey\nReasonable people would say why would turn to go after this man after twenty three years other than because uh I'm going to assume some industry was affective Turkish people were being led to Christ why else would they go after him ... what other uh issue might there be for the reason\nThey would go after him and because you know obviously I'm there would be no doubt that may have been some moms that ultimately wanted to come after him because of Islam and they didn't want people being converted from Islam to Christianity and so they concocted these false charges that he was a member of an armed a terrorist organization you imagine\nThere's a pasture twenty three years he wants to be permanent there you can imagine that you're going to be a member of an armed terrorist organization to bring violence to turkey now he wants to bring the gospel of Jesus Christ church\nMore of an interview on pastor Brunson return\nChristian I don't talk while there sign up for the podcast and receive great interviews like this one\nOn Guinness is a respected speaker and

for your life in Chicago with mark ...\nI'd like to hear just a little piece of audio from the news ah from the last couple of days as we begin our conversation so let's do that quickly\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to recognize and respect is Frank\nAnd you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell the president\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nMm okay how do you respond to that kind of thinking\nWell I thought ... son also Eric Holder's remarks as they Olmert attorney general ... credit irresponsible and his reason was because the tragedy is that when words breakdown violence is never far away\nAnd that's the trouble of where we are my book is about the present crisis and I think a lot of people get wrong some people that just absolutely hung up on Trump never\nPro Trump and I think Trump is not the issue is the consequence of the class is not the cause ... and people need to get down to analyzing what the causes because you've got\nTwo very different views of the American public tens of American freedom and that's the cheapest they were all those things like ... and does all national is to go with us and so on\nAnd when you get down to that you see that one sided it's actually\nGoing back to the ideas of the American revolution which was largely on that not tightly typical for the reformation\nAnd the other on with him in many cases going back to the enlightenment\nAnd the French Revolution and thoroughly empty ... then when you look at things like a lot of them is multiculturalism political correctness the sexual revolution an income for the sake and much of a ...
