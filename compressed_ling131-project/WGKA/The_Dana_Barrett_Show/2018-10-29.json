absolutely and and all the pictures of very elementary understanding of the country do you understand that that was a there was not only a constant in the in the formation of our of our country but the way they live back\nNow one of the uh the standards of our country is freedom of religion and over the weekend we had a horrible shooting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at a synagogue\nBy a very deranged and very upset and very mean an evil person and I want to first let all the members of the Jewish communities are listening to us know that\nHearts and prayers go out to you and um we we can't comprehend how anyone could do something like this this is a heinous act oh you're without doubt\nAnd and my my other Mexico yours a ... whenever somebody does something like this are automatically their their mental status has to come into play uh obviously this guy's affected by something jade is a big one of the Jewish community has been\nTargeted throughout history by by people who have a harbored great eight against them or to to the point of a mass executions during World War two incidents like this so you know\nIt has to stop and you know they they have a saying never again well in the larger scale that that that word came out or it has to have to apply here as well\nMhm then of course um we'll hear about this for the days and weeks to come as more things will come out about what's going on but them this was directly on top of what happened friday when the arrest was made in the bombing\nOf the bombs that were sent out to Florida for the most part uh down here in adventure of Florida which is right there by the ... post offices were about eleven I guess there was eleven or the bombs or maybe it was ten I forget the exact number were sent from there the others were sent actually in New York City\nAgain we have to call into question the mental status of this person and as much as the left is going to want to make this about partisan politics which has to do with mental health ... you don't mail bombs the people you don't walk to worship the search shoot people a\nFew political differences you debate them and you're going to beat them waiting name calling\nAnd they and and and violence now you know ... they're going to make a big deal out of this guy suddenly bombs too too liberal progressive and I've got to call him a fascist leaders love\n'em but you know these said people have to condemn the the violent acts which keeps a better to watch\nNow your phone was starting to fade out there so hopefully you lean into the window some more but job the vice president I had this to say a late last week about this caravan niche reportedly had it in our direction here's what he said\nAs President Trump said earlier this week it as nothing short of an assault on our country\nAnd he said today and I see myself to those in the\nCaravan turn around we are not going to allow you to answer our illegal\nI'm all for that but of course we sent eight hundred support troops down to the border I Believe that came out of Fort Bragg North Carolina a part of what we sat down there was a U.S Army Corps of engineers which to me\nAre based on some of the intel I'm getting back they're actually taking some of the easily accessible territory down there and making it just a little bit more difficult to come try and across our border by putting in what they call up berms you know those are right\n... and any of this is just one more argument for the for a wall that's right\nYou you know this is see if it is incredulous for anybody to believe that this is an orchestrated\nAnd and financed by people who want to see this happen not to mention a condoned by governments are shot from the border you don't have this kind of a mass of sold on a on a border when people have to travel through other countries to get there without their collusion\nYou know so you have this number of people trying to enter into your country it's hard to believe that you can't use the word legitimately use the word invasion and and that's an act of war\nAnd they are using that term and this is an invasion by unarmed people or they're not armed by weapons which means that we can't meet them uh where's the armed force because uh that's not what we do with our military down on their border because of a little something called the ... act you know\nPeople want to keep talking about them being on our Nineteen hijackers on nine eleven were unarmed where they came into this country as well\nYeah but they were armed with box cutters [laughter] you know that is a hobby that is a weapon but\nThey they were armed after they got here my point is people coming into the country can come in on our ... and still do great harm to the country and our people\nAre sure of the ... this idea that they're on the armed it doesn't really speak to their mindset about why they're covered over the border so ... you can't differentiate between the two if you're trying to come here illegally ... with the ferry as more of and that's what this giant group is doing they don't care about our laws\nThey don't care about how you're supposed to go by the process\nOf entering our country to be here they're just coming and and you know that you have to take that into consideration\nAnd I'll be right back with more than ... bottles of managing of the new media journal by the way these folks are about a thousand miles away from our border right now and the group that was seven thousand is now about three thousand to thirty three hundred they've lost a lot\nThe way because of the fact they gave up they can't go any further than that is a good thing is uh about two thousand of a circus Iowa\nIn Mexico [noise] maybe just the amount of the day I'll be right back\n[noise]\n[noise] let's talk about your business for a minute [noise] thinking that I'll be things you're doing to attract\nThe town between networking events in ... you're probably spending plenty of time and money to find the right people know what was your office tracking employees today's my boys noble game winning off that he designed around the way they weren't\n... makes it even

to stick to my guns I'm going to tell you right now that uh the go the G O P is going to add three to five senators this time around because a Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp\nAnd Joe Donnelly are the three for sure they're going to get and I think they're going to pick up a couple of more including Scott that's four and then there'll be a fifth one somewhere along the line what are you saying\nNo it it's hard to think that the red wave isn't the reality when you take into consideration the special lectures ever happened over the last two years\nYou know the economy is is good and they ended we're we're adding jobs were looking at people who are able to to use the extra income from the tax cubs to invest food to increase their well for the opportunity and when people are happy with their wallets through usually happy with the powers that be\nSo I tend to agree that we're going to see positive things happening in the in the outcomes or we'll see what the numbers are actually are\nNow the generic pole real clear politics right now has the Democrats for two hundred and five seats the Republicans were two hundred and one and twenty nine up for grabs but I'm going to go out on a limb and say right now by the slimmest margins of Republicans will still have the lead in Congress and the house of representatives\nGo I I I Believe that the houses is much more safer than you know we're definitely going to make your maintain and and probably ... seats in the house side of this the one that I'm looking at a little bit more of the curious I\nSend it it's going to be better than a house that's going to be up to the deal there because there's been a lot of uproar send a lot of people are mad about that Kavanaugh saying\nWell and they should be mad about the cabinet off a that was ridiculous and the Democrats especially the ... the progressive Democrats in leadership they have to be taught a lesson with strong message that we don't care for those tactics anymore when it comes to\nA judiciary but everything all the way around start arguing and debating the merits and and knock it off with the slash and burn scare tactic pull up politics nobody likes it\nBy the way very soon Mr Michael ... and that the sweat neck woman are going to be indicted for lying to the Congress and making up a story and NBC News could somehow or another be dragged into this because they went along with the hopes and actually played along with them\nWell why not you have to hold people accountable for bad actions\nParty we've got to tell us out of here you your your show stuff look for us on
