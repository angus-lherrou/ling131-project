that very much and if you check my website and those other sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Laurie and\nIn fact I'll be filling in for Dennis Prager on Monday in this hour I'd be remiss if I didn't start out talking about the recent spate of bombs or at least a would be bombs I guess and the arrest of suspect\nI don't even want to say his name because often these people like the fame or infamy for that matter that they acquire by these dastardly acts suspect but we did have previous arrests and was known to the authorities but we\nCan't prevent every crime or a threat in this country I'm Amazed that we prevent as many as we do and and you know figure out who's up to what but one has to be impressed with the quick action of the authorities to find the suspect\nIt will never ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent our law enforcement people are they are truly amazing\nAnd and in fact the one of the things I set for all the years that you know the top press is not that effective had bought the day in and day out people who do the job are terrific and it was good to see by the way the FBI Director make a statement about the effectiveness of his team\nAnd others who helped out actually I don't know what I felt the FBI Director disappeared and he was on the FBI's ten most wanted list you know never hear from him in his like he doesn't exist\nI've not been happy with his lack of enthusiasm and taking actions against those news department who abuse their authority and they clearly did\nAnd speaking of unhappy with leadership I see where attorney general sessions if you're watching today he made a statement showing some leadership and one of his last\nMy opinion likely high profile lax before his dismissed I I think the only reason he's not being dismissed by the president is 'cause all the issues and people you know with the Mueller investigation and everything else that's going on and\nHis next attorney general wouldn't be approved right now with you know what do you want another uh Kavanaugh hearing to take place that's not the time but he's never lived up to the expectations I have for him\nAnd I think many others did too I don't remember he was the first one that came out for President Trump's ... among the first senator who did so and he took some of what a risk so you think he's got courage he's a risk taking nah\nIt's such a nice asleep at the wheel sometimes to\nActually now that I think of it he an FBI Director re never seemed to have the\nPassion and energy that I think is necessary and their job and speaking of big surprise I was impressed with the postal employees who helped in this effort you know catch capture the suspect\nI never stay I'm being so mean Sean I never thought they could move that fast and let me ... I'm Sorry I'm Sorry\nI Know I was just thinking about it well you ever you know that there was an older you'll see them and if people remember Steve Allen did the Tonight Show and he wrote this book call I think it was a dumb ass and he said he pulled up to the post office had one heavy box he's having a lot of trouble lifting the box he finally gets to the counter at the post office\nAnd the clerk and Steve Allen is the only one there he was before Johnny Carson and the coach says where's your number\nAnd Steve Allen says I don't have a number he says well you'll have to go back and could not much we can freeze the box always it back plus I Want you know those numbers like you might get at a bakery or at a deli counters something\nGrabs the ticket comes back with a heavy box walks up to the counter he's the only when they're in the postal clerk says Thirteen call this number but that's the postal service right that's always been the reputation hey but you've got to give them credit seems those who investigated these kinds of things that an excellent job [noise]\nUm but seriously it never ceases to amaze me a professional an excellent our law enforcement people are ... I ... you know President Trump says we have the best and the ...\nThink in in this case you know around the world when there's investigations of plane crashes or any issue like that they have a you know last plane lost ships whatever it was called the United states we have tremendous law enforcement people\nWhich by the way it's on the side was why it was so disappointing to see the upper echelons of the FBI and the Justice Department\nEngage in a soft coup I think a lot of people's knowledge that now against the legitimately elected president of the United states Donald Trump or unhappiness with these top officials as I said was never meant to reflect on the regular agents those who do the work day in and day out\nAnd the FBI and other agencies\nWhich as I said that's why so disgraceful to see those in power tarnish the image of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies and then you have the Democrats saying\nAll the Republicans don't support the FBI no we do support the FBI we don't support it becoming you know it's an image being so tarnished and so ruined because some of you and gauge day not at all like a banana republic activities that's why we're unhappy with the top people or the Justice Department people like Clapper Brennan and the rest of them\nSo whether the suspect winds up being someone with deep mental issues or someone who's just evil\nThe fact remains that in this country you do not get back at your political enemies by threatening them with harm or worse you just don't do that\nNeedless to say these type of acts can do irreparable damage to our political system\nAnd the you know you don't you know on the line I think of what the ah the Hillary Clinton people left and those who are out to get the president is what they were doing that's why we're so disastrous someone should be pointed that out\nWhen he tried to do the political system is what you guys already with the political system and trying to get legitimately elected as a president or impeached\nNo one can defend this behavior and everyone should condemn this is pure evil no matter which side of the political spectrum the perpetrator is on and it looks like we all know looks like what did he have a stickers on his van and actually it looks like one of those crazy is that you want to be around no matter what side but heck and certainly\nWe all get deeply frustrated and disappointed when people we disagree with control our destiny\nIt always amazes me that those in the resistance against President Trump have no clue nor did they probably care that we were is unhappy with this election and the re election of President Obama to the presidency as they were with President Trump's victory\nThat would never dawned on them never never never dawned on them [noise]\nAfter all many of us thought Iraq Obama was the worst president in our lifetime if not in our history so what are the you know it was five days I think it was five days before the election that he wanted to fundamentally change the United states of America we are far away\nThe middle class you're not as [noise]\nI'd always gotten the wrong I always thought it was seven days that he really gave notice how quickly for job you to give to let us know ... days before that [noise] what previous presidents I Want to ask you had said anything even close to that\nAnd which president went on an apology tour soon after being reelected\nHistory has made when a leader steps up stays true to his values in charge so fundamentally different course for the country\nThat's 'cause you're not in power when you get a power I Wonder if you agree that we should try a fundamentally different course when we get in power that he wasn't even Obama I didn't even know that well he should have was right yeah [noise]\nAnd apologize for what you may know my sign of is always a pleasure privilege to have like front of the greatest history a country in the history of the world\nBut we're on our side never engaged in a resistance as such we never engaged in a soft coup we never threatened to bomb the White House than those actresses or singers threatened that like that march that day of or the day after whatever it was\nPrinted you see this in the New York times uh about the assassination of the current president I guess it's supposed to be fiction obviously but ah we don't do that kind of stuff but the left and the Democrats and the press what'd you really the same thing\nHas never accepted as victory and will do anything to remove him from office that seems clear including blaming his rhetoric for the suspects violence which is where I'm going to go now even before anything they knew you know they didn't know much about the suspect\nSo this will be used and is being used to hurt President Trump and the Republicans\nEspecially with the November elections just stays away [noise] so this guy did it because of what President Trump says that's what they'll have you believe [noise]\nYou're on with mark Highmark\nHi Mark that Mark I'm what you were bringing up about a media is absolutely true\nThey don't want to report the fact that the a psycho and he is a psycho prior to the threatened to blow up Florida light power and I I don't know some other bump to sow what Trump responsible for though no\nHappens to be just you know the the ... the global curse of the ... now and another distinction is the fact that you know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them up or ... you said a few times during his is a a\nA not his candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times he said oh yeah go ahead on the base or something like that that was that but\nHe hasn't done anything like that where the the law whether it's the actual a political of people or the the news uh they've all actually said there\nAre going out and confront them and and and and run them out of the stores all this other stuff so um again that's that's part of the contrast and different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face wherever you see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know they're in the cabinet ... this is\nWhat they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that [laughter]\nOh of course it's the the the ultimate double standard that everyone recognizes that accept them well do they recognize it but they're not going to say it and even most of the hard core I Would say\nYou know a intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic that are reacting to something there that way if the Trump arrangements that now they could argue that that's the cause of it now too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah it ... you know that's what they would say no question about it breaking ATF news just recently in the U.S department of education announced that\nActing on a complaint filed by

that but um I and I voted for President Obama twice while a\nI'm Sorry I did that but I Love President Trump a I changed from Democrat to Republican I've heard that a lot of people have done that\nAnd we need I I Know President Trump was going to win because I Believe that got his hand on that man here's the strong man he is a an intelligent man\nHe knows what to do he wants to do the right thing

Hurley told us what side swipe is all about\n[noise] I think that it's a comedy and you can I get that that that that it's tackling dating in the digital era and then it's going to deal with relationships but romantic and they see my mom and then our cat also dating and she's in her fifties and widowed\nI'm living with my character and starting her life over for the first time and killing on a dating app and then you have my younger sister again that are twenty and she's the millennial\nKind of living by the ... or you know she got married for thirty has a kid but now it's sort of feeling like that seven year itch and her marriage and getting a little bit bored wondering if she made the right decision in his living vicariously to our character that we're having fun\nSo tell us about your character Olivia what kind of person who she\nTight and the beginning she works in insurance doing really well\nI'm without a relationship for the last few years she had a five year why not you know after she got out she just went over to our work and didn't date and had done really well and so now she's starting pitcher attacks are into getting on tinder after she goes to the gynecologist ... played by ... they get right down there that\nAt thirty five basically you're starting to dry up and if you ever want to have a kid there anything you'd better you know like he kinda got to get started on at least dating um which is a lot I think I think that women here in the thirties and there was such a thorough there on tender and um he decides to date I'll let her ... and you'll see her kind of start opening up throughout the season\nAnd becoming a different person away all of them have big ark\nWell she has two hundred and fifty two matches so yeah\nSince Olivia do is type of doing the ultimate in speed dating or are you assume that not every day there's a home run is now is that the case\nAnd also she's not always the home run you know what I mean like I feel like that's a big part of dating is\nIowa in the ... you know that like drink too much or I was the one that was the date sometimes it right in the first episode you'll see that she's the one that the man I'm and it's not a data that we ... the it's not like you'll see a different data every week and then you know we're going to go on to and in fact it's really not that it's just the jumping off point of the show\nBut the show is really a grounded it's about life more than it is about just hinder dating and these relationships between the mom and sister\nAnd I think a lot of people will find related bowl and a lot of it's based on my own experiences in life whether it be with dating or just embarrassing things like the gynecologist office that thing happened to me I'm so you'll see a lot of that stuff brought to life where it's kind of cringe worthy comedy sometimes [laughter] but I Love to watch\nSo when do you think that many matches with Olivia learned about human beings and what does she perhaps alert them so\nYeah I mean that's that's really the message is is\nYou know she's not at the end of the day she not out looking for Mr Right to save the day and come in and you know live happily ever after\nI'd like to get the message across that you know you're going to even experience all these things in life but really the most important thing is she's figuring out who she is and what she loves that if somebody gets into that part you know naturally than great\nBut it's these three women kind of figuring out who they are at the later stages in life\nUm and and how important that is\nAnd how much it affects you if you bring somebody in and get married and make that everything to you what happens like right on and when her husband died she left with nothing you know she has no skills he's never had a job and she has to come up with my character\nAnd I and so a big part of it is just you know as women I think we're we're taught as kids like the print Saturday live happily ever after any find your print and all that stuff and it's just it's so much more about know figure out who you are you know do your thing they get what makes you happy and if somebody fits into that great\nYou mentioned the ... mom Mary she's old dating\nPlay by rather than our cat is amazing\nThe fact is the no she was something in common is that India do vetting him sort of relationship did they become closer his mother and daughter\nIn certain ways that died in certain ways that it it you know a makes it worse because your mom and dating and she's living with her and her she's a little bit like a teenager you know what I mean she's like I said she never had a job if you're going to see her\nGet a job for first time like figure out what it's like to be independent and Olivia their role to reverse where Olivia is more like the mom and she's like the kid\nSo and how that affects Olivia when she really just needs a mom you know\nLike it it sort of based on like when my mom was single and her fifties they're very different my mom's very independent but the idea that um that that when you're when she's doing that and they kind of to become your friend as opposed to your mom and how that affects the relationship I always found that really interesting and I bring that into their relationship\nTo you mentioned the rules and of course is is your ... was it like working with her\nIt was really fun I mean she's a proud she's been doing this forever and she's so good and honestly it was perfect for the role like as soon as her name was brought up everybody we were just trying to think who would who would be good for this role you know somebody in their fifties that embodies all of these characteristics are good at least play them and she was she was dead on and\nWhen we met her she just was game to do anything so that was awesome and and had her own ideas I wanted to bring menopause into this world you know what I mean like what it's like to be going to ... I found that really funny and interesting and sad\nI'm so she was great I mean the fact that he was gay to do everything it's a very vulnerable role that I think a lot of actresses would have trouble playing that she took on end did have challenges but but handled them really well and I think now that the end\nRight now you mentioned that size why is partially autobiographical so humbled to believe you truly you\n[noise] you know it's it's it's based on parts of me you know but it's not it's not like it's definitely not an autobiography it's not I'm not just like\nPlaying myself exactly there's a lot of things about her that maybe are things that I went through before that she still having to go through or they're loosely based on even like other people that I Know that I'll bring into the character but I always at the core of it almost every character I write has a piece of me and them\nUm so so there's that but it's definitely not an autobiography um I don't I you know I'm not\nAs uptight as her and closed minded as she is you know but there are there are big pieces of of me that are in there for sure\nSo personally when it comes online dating your view what are some of the positives and we'll just some of the news\nWell negatives I think it's you know there's a lot there's a lot of choice and I think it makes it for people will you know\nLike if it makes it hard people to settle down like they they'll like somebody and then there'll be like but what else is out there because there is something else out there you know there's a little you can go home and and go to bed and get your phone out and start swiping on more people and have two more days the next day if you want\nSo I think that that can be a little bit of a negative it help it it it makes it where people it's hard to connect I mean not that that in the show it's easy to match hard to can act I think that's a big problem but positives are I went on there\nAnd had all those two hundred and fifty two matches in real life and I met my boyfriend who I've been with for over two years so I think you know if you can just kind of sift through and when you find somebody that's worth it and great stop and take it in and connect it can be really amazing 'cause I wasn't a man or otherwise\nRight and you know we think the way that you know the forefront of a mountain and say well I think today [laughter] you can't judge people by on that side I think you know you have to pay people in that time\nTo understand why they why they they don't want they did what they did but like I said everybody has a everybody had a family everybody was worried about you know standing in line\nIt's the same major consensual way kind of human\nAnd Andrew working people find out more about secrets on line\n[noise] well ...
