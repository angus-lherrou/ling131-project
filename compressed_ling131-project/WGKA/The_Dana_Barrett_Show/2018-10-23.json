some serious you think they're all wonderful people you got some bad people in those groups you got some tough faithful in those goods and I'll tell you what this country does it want them [noise]\nWell yeah we don't want them because number one we don't know what kind of diseases are bringing in right absolutely\nAnd we don't know who's in that a big caravan which I'm going to call it an invasion of Denise Simon calls it an insurgency but we don't know who's in there we know there is there much Thirteen mixed in with that crowd crowd there may be some uh ISIS supporters in there to we just don't know who's ... this this deal\nWhere we do know that there are some of the church and she shook the Arab people don't care and they're coming here to do a huge harm\nUm we got to decide this invasion it's actually been going on for quite a while this is just selling have you ever get several yes this is just a part of it and finally we have a question that's recognizing this at least this portion of the invasion we have this many people coming in to our country on a monthly basis\nWho's financing this George Soros and others yeah but it was a George Soros personally\nI'm\nOK directly indirectly indirectly you are right it's George Soros open society\nFoundations and fellow travelers at something\nFor a number of years this is how he does he does not do it directly he put some money into their and then they turn around and give grants to these different associations but white deer here who some of the people are that are involved in this year ready sure Catholic charities Baptist church charities\n... charities to name the stream major churches at all have us connection so at all a lot of\nThese churches are paid off to to to do\nThat is correct ... yeah so this is like a business for them\nYeah and what an unholy alliance so to speak\nWell we're in I'm not going to try to you know put religion down or anything like that but it's it's rather obvious to me from where I'm sitting that this has become a big profit business for these organizations feel uh because they don't\nPut down to a religious Genovese you jump to this is an unholy alliance they're shipping money how slow horrible people I've met strip the bottom line\nIt just got to be exposed because it's all tax deductible those people\nGet a tax deduction and what they're doing and what they're what they're doing is is just not in my book and sat pro American now if you want to talk about food for the poor World Vision Samaritans persons who are doing it the right way not\nTaking any money from the likes of a George Soros I mean there you go and uh let's see feed the children there's another one of the children\nNeed to help these countries to help themselves and I don't mean by\nDumping money on them teaching them how they can live\nAs a society of the the real deal is because I Am I can say it that way because we've already spent billions and billions and billions of dollars to each nation you bet\nAnd by the way they're using some of that money also to help from these people to help give them water bottles and feed them and transport them so the combination of George shows his money and some of the money that we're going down to these nations so we need to cut them off\nAnd I just pray that uh our military personnel are at the border in time to stop these go well\nThey can't just show up on the border doesn't work that way there has to be a national emergency declared on the border I guess what Congress has to authorize a she can't just send the troops down there and say here we go\nWell the president does have the authority by the way to declare an emergency and wants to emergencies declared to take action because this is an emergency this isn't a literal invasion and they are allowed to do harm in many ways yeah\nBut that he has to have the blessing of the Congress the house of representatives which which so far I think he'll get because I don't think we're going to lose that many seats there or we might lose a couple or three or four but we're still going to be in control but that's the way it works I've done plenty of stand\nYou know but the the one thing that works too there's a literal invasion on the country\nI'm president has take action whether he has a blessing of Congress or not this is a literal emergency which can affect the future of this country in a bad bad way all these people are allowed to just jump into this country they're coming here to do some\nOf the U.S can do it on their own to yeah yep well they\nJust stayed any state almost border states can declare an emergency and they can have the national guard down there in five minutes from now if they do it correctly\nSo money we've got to do something\nYep and there will be something done the question is uh what's it going to be and how soon as you're going to be by the way before we have to go to break have you noticed what is going to slow this caravan ...\nWho knows what's going to slow down yeah hurricane Willa yeah\nA major big time barn burner category almost five category for similar to what Michael was coming ashore today right there at the Capitol ability couple's son Lucas started down in that resort area you're going to come across in his act they're going to stop the\nAny forward progress of this caravan because if they're out there in ... in this I ain't going to be pretty\nHold that thought hold that thought books should be right back with more on a captain's American third watch Ron Edwards host of the Edwards no

term right\nYeah All right and uh I Can't see where that's going to happen this time they might not going to happen they might lose they\nMight lose two or three maybe four seats in the house they're still going to be in the majority but a Senate I'm telling you right now the Senate they're going to pick up three four maybe even five seats from what I'm seeing right now\nAbsolutely absolutely but one thing that does concern me really does concern me as\nLord oh boy yeah well I Know all boys right um this Gillum guy out in can anyone breathing\nWith the history of Florida the past Twenty years
