I'm not going to dwell on this but the man charged with killing\nEleven people in a synagogue and Pittsburgh on Saturday more\n\nThis is just a a horrible\nSituation and of course our hearts go out for all of our friends and the Jewish community but to all Americans are as well as all people around the world that have to go through the shortest saying uh every day of the year\nIncluding in Israel where you know they have things like missiles fired at them almost every day\nIf they do um [noise] it's a horrible situation over there\nWasn't the Iron Dome and and and that's real life would be pretty difficult over there because they were getting ... rockets shot in their direction every day and and it was hardly ever covers it amazing\nHow that you know aren't um [noise] it is what it is is you like to say a ... foot my prayers go out to the families of those who were shot there and in Pittsburgh\nAnd uh it's my open and clear that this guy does get the death penalty I think that's what he deserves and a must be ... as well\nWell we have to face the fact that one political party a year's been mainstreaming a normal normalizing anti Semitism and a spoiler alert folks it's the Democratic party make no mistake about it\nAbsolutely one of the Democratic party has been you know very anti Semite for a long time yeah ah they are very bigoted as an organization and we get the ah [noise] they're the ones isn't it funny how they are always accusing others are being what they really are themselves [noise]\nUm you know and it's been in that way for such a long time I mean they're anti Israel or many of them I'm not going to say all Democrats with many of them have shown themselves to be rather an anti Israel\nUm don't one needs to go no further back then the pirate ministry shouldn't and you saw how that Democrat leader dealt with Israel and and the Jewish people\nNow let's talk about uh the border and I have the statement\nFrom the department of defense on support given to the department of homeland security because the way this all came about fifty two hundred troops that are being sent to the Mexican border or to counter the caravans that are coming not one not two but at least three maybe four now we're hearing I'm going to read the statement\nAnd says [noise] and this is from the department of defense\nWhich says and I quote after receiving a request for assistance from the secretary of homeland security the secretary of defense has approved providing mission enhancing capabilities because the department of homeland security\nUS Customs and border protection along the southwestern border to this assistance is in addition to the previously authorized support of sea BP's operation guardian support mission which was approved back in April when they could have as many as four thousand troops there for support purposes only now the department\nWill provide defense support through civil authorities\nWould planning assistance engineering support which will include temporary barriers are called Jersey berms barricades and fencing\nNow they'll have fixed it rotary wing aviation support there to move CBP personnel medical James ... treat and prepare for commercial transport patients\nAnd command and control facilities plus they'll have temporarily housing there for CBP personnel and any people that they take into custody\nAnd also personal protective equipment proceed be personnel to boot now one last little thing you watch the northern command will be the lead for the duration of the operation and it's in support of the customs and border protection um group so\nThis is a monumental changed or what they're doing and by the way the military police that are going down there are going down there to assist the a a border patrol and US Customs and border protection groups\nThey will be armed with their side arms or because they will be there in a law enforcement capacity\nTo assist another federal agency\n[noise] okay it's a lot more people that are being sent down there\nA few hundred old enough\nTo basically um watch are the people coming in so there's not going to be a real protection of our border it shifts to more people gathered down there to assist and watch these people come in\nDo you believe the president when he says they're not going to get in\nI Believe\nHe is in the heart of hearts wants to make that happen next you know make sure they don't get him [noise] but um [noise] 'cause you know saying they're not\nThere they go ahead and then there is I think it's article for something like that somewhere where the president does have authority to prevent people from coming in and they do present a national threat to our to our country\nI think there is some provision for that\nWell he again there's a procedure they have to go about in the middle of the procedure is something we've explained over and over again a lot of people don't understand what we're all I don't know\nI Know if they get permission from Congress but I don't think but I think there is\nA well no no no he can declare a state of emergency down there because look what happens is the governor's a tell him that they want a of of whatever and they declare a state\nOf emergency as a result based on what the governors aspartame wait hold that thought we'll get back to run and we're just the ... guy and uh it's got nothing to do with insurrection okay the insurrection act has nothing to do with this puppy right back\nDon't go anywhere [noise] everybody this is a captain ... students who the six am here tonight

costs of Medicare plans will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best right help markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and say honey\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice

enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act\nAre in the um the mode right now they want us to increase those interests wage\nMhm now I mentioned um and I'm going to bring this up again uh pertaining to the border\nYou know where to Jersey barrier is writer Jersey Bermuda seen them before oh yeah absolutely they are being transported by the truckload right now down to the U.S Mexican border from wherever and however they're stored or because they use them at all these different construction projects\nWhen they uh take four lanes put him down industry or to or whatnot and there's a whole bunch of I'm headed to the U.S Mexican border and I told your during the break I was told by some of the farmers that I've talked to down along the Texas Mexico border that uh the\n... they and you made a joke about this a while ago what did you say about digging a trench\nOr you're using a back home and uh 'cause I should or if I had a ranch down there with the big big big in these big holes or the back row and trenches and never oh ditch I said I Would dig ditches and cover them over\nWell I guess what\nThe Army Corps of engineers has had some of their heavy equipment down there and some of those places\nDigging a ditch to make it that much harder to get across end of the United states have places where they could basically just walk over now they got a big ditch to contend with a big covered if you will that they're also going to put these Jersey barriers that and make it even more difficult and it's about time\nYeah ... ...\nAnd nobody has been reporting that because they don't want you to know\nWell well well we do know but you know I I think they do need the ditches to assist the Jersey barriers because Jersey barriers are pretty easy to her\nWell they are if you don't have it but there's a little problem ... called constant gene where you are right now all we ever tried to hop over something would cost ... sharp it\nCuts you to pieces you know I haven't yeah well there's going to be lots of miles and miles and miles hundreds of miles and Constantine where it's going to be laid out down on the border\nThat's good gr my words and it's already being done\nThere will be a good substitute until we finally get our wall\nThat's right and that's exactly what it is a substitute until they can build a wall and this again goes to prove why they need the wall right\nNow I Would like to know how much it is costing put those uh Jersey you know Jersey barriers the wire that ditch you to take the ditches and all that I Know it costs something and it's not cheap and I was wondering how much of that cause could have been used to build some wall\nI guarantee you a guarantee of what they're paying to do that they could have already build a lot of the wall a lot of it but here's the thing that they've already had the Jersey barriers store those construction sites they laid literally have hundreds of them available\nAll the time and a lot of different areas around the country because it's something very common that you see that all they're doing is bringing all the extra once thank God\nWhoever the whoever the Jersey barrier\n... counter is sending them all down there towards the border so you'll see 'em and I guarantee you when some of these reporters figure out what's going on for some of them are very smart they'll actually go to war this
