worse than Saudi Arabia because he\nRan is a far greater danger to the west\nAnd to Israel and Saudi Arabia is which is a danger more to itself although I fully acknowledge the Saudi contribution to a

to\nYeah okay I don't know I don't know rumors of\nWould have been Saudi Arabia was not prices\nYou make the point that\nGift giving them is that they're fleeing theoretically up the persecution this may be the first in history where the country are fleeing persecution from you march with their flag\nRight right I I I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt is gracefully\nBack Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany\nThey weren't waving Nazi flags and singing German nationalist songs and talking about how they're going to transform English us in the U.S in Germany the image I mean that the people are mixing up the Jewish refugees in Germany with the German American button you know\nUm these people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by the government's they're they're just living in kinda crappy countries\nYou know and those countries are crappy for a reason\nUh for historical and cultural and political reasons that 'cause they never embraced ordered liberty they um they ... they inherited a bad dictatorial political culture from Spain uh whereas we inherited a kind of an anti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England and\nAs a result they have worse government worse economies they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things there's a great\nLatin American economists her and I think his name is turned on the court\nOr ... I think it's ...\nSoto was found out\nThis photo and even if you enforce property rights of the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from thugs and from Troy drug lords Latin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence of it they were fleeing to America and we have a huge welfare magnet\nA lot of these people even if they they come in and start working their kids will grow up properly I public assistance large percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away refugees get a get a whole honey pot full of benefits from the government\nOh so what do you think is going to happen or when they reach the American border\nWell my hope is that we will have the U.S military lined up and choking off the entire border and I think President Trump ... he's already said this is a national emergency he should start using defense funds to start constructing the wall\nYou ought to lay the he ought to lay the cornerstone of the wall gold plated with the big tea on it\nAnd start building the wall led Congress scream and yell blood judges scream and yell he should for their court orders and continue to use as authorities commander in chief to seal the border\nAnd ... and take money away from gardening Afghanistan's border if necessary to guard at the United states sport or [laughter] that's what we elected him for we didn't like Jeb Bush we didn't elect Nikki Haley we elected Donald Trump because we wanted to put America First out if we're going to be global policemen you know charity begins at home\nAnd there's a crucial point I think because people feel a sense of moral moral ambivalence oh these people they just want to improve their lives okay first of all that is true of half the world's if you are going to say that you if you pick up in Honduras and say this sucks I'm outta here\nI'm going to the U.S up if that is enough to get you went to the U. S. gets what most of the Islamic world would like to come to\nVirtually everyone in China would like to come I bet Bangladesh Pakistan you could empty the world in the United states and our welfare system will be bankrupt within you know\nThirty six hours but hey at least we feel good about ourselves as we you know starve to death and watch the civil war overwhelm our country and turn it into a what I call Akaka stand like so many other parts of the world but what about the moral argument\nI think we should see our country as a larger extension of our private homes\nIf ... if somebody bangs on your door and says he's homeless and demands to live in your living room you have a right to shut the door and use whatever forces required to stop someone from staying in your house and eating your food against your will the exact same thing occurs applies to us as a country is our country of common home\nThat we work on and we improve and we leave to our children were grateful our grandparents we lead to our children we judiciously accept new commercial or something to offer or\nAre we just ... a giant refugee camp like the ones we see your you know in Turkey and Jordan where anybody who shows up you have to take him in and you put them on the same girl and given the same uniform and they and they gather around the same trash you know\nTrash cans with a fire is that the future of America\nTo me politically this is gonna happen\nPresumably right before the incredibly important congressional elections right and I I I I worry given the butter bias of the media\nThat we will just have video after video and photo after photo of some American either military person or ice person or a border guard are pushing some mom was a baby\nAnd then uh it's it's it seems to me they win the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and then suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets in at a George Soros funded attorney\nNo that's not to forgive me John that's not the propaganda war that swimming the war I agree but the propaganda war you know I mean I I just didn't want to let me let me just breaking point\nIt seems to me that they win if they get in and the women say don't get it\nAnd I don't because if they are good I Hope you're right there's no little toys I you're right\nI think if Trump shows weakness if he tapes then Republicans across the country we just our hearts saying we realize the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status\nIf even Donald Trump can't say no to something this ludicrous and politically cooked up\nThen we're we're toast and I think that would depress turnout\nOnline I I agree with you I agree with you I just I agree with you I'm so I think if she I dance term it'd be nice if you have to learn that that will mean in picture in pictorial form that they will be fights between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us because I think people see\nThat this is an invasion they can see it the people who are going to cry because a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back those people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out for for\nA poor otherwise going to turn out this is a national impeachment referendum the less space has already fanatical they've got their their ... ready they're ready to go to the polls they've got their dead people registered to vote but left is all\nReady at its maximum frenzy and hysteria they've maxed out\nWhat the Kavanaugh hearings did was wake up the Republican base a wake up

Texas Senator Ted Cruz as you hear in the interview he was forty one layer in China's which helps explain why I'm here today but enough about that enjoys and say\nWell Senator Cruz talked me a little bit about these nine a suspicious packages at least one of them was a real bomb the president's condemned the vice presidents condemned that Rod Rosenstein condemned I'm sure you're going to condemn it\nBut the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy it's either some not in the basement where it's a hospital power messing with our election\nBut what do you make of the attempt to blame Trump\nI Love it if the media dealing with the media does which which is any any narrative that they can twist against Trump they will do so this is terrible I mean this is terrorism and whoever the terrorists do\nI Need to be ... you need to be prosecuted needs to be put in jail for a long long time\nAnd a an up and it that'll happen you know it's interesting you remember some months ago uh we we had the bomber in ... ah after setting up a route Austin and and I met with uh the ... of the yacht oh we're leading the ... or so and the

pot on a regular basis\nYou know it's kind of work to want to buy because\nIn some ways marijuana was a creative force in my life I Would you know I wrote almost all my book I all the time and I I Can't although\nIn retrospect there there's a lot of there are a lot of scenes in the novels that are about getting high I think there will be fewer of those but you know it it it helped me come up with certain like fancy indecent jokes and the creative stimulant subways but uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative\nSince I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present\nFor my family and my friends I feel like my life is in order professionally in a way that it wasn't is that as much chaos and I'm and most

thing you you mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years did your wife ever share a year and says he has them for a lead\nNo in fact you know she doesn't see the opposite no she she has no interest in it at all um and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem or just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know because the the ... the marijuana is an addictive it in some ways it's considered a health food\nUm and so I just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism and my family um and obviously has the addiction gene I just ... it it it just didn't

commissioner Bernie Carrick he oversaw the police response to nine eleven they spoke on AM five Seventy the mission\nYour reaction to a where these pipe bombs may be coming from and what is this the psychology behind the guy that's doing it and how are we on the on the trail of finding them\n[noise] um so let me say this you know we're we're on speculating here you know nobody posters sure know based on what the FBI NYPD has seen\nThey believe that the ... by the same person or persons date or is that\nYour child's and ... ... ... screening use U.S Postal service screening which tells me up to ... and it's working people lie nothing detonated so far right ... ...\nIt will be much much easier to do it as it stands you know as far as who saw it a ... you know I I was really every eight to one person to achieve a look ... and nobody knows for sure the people on the left is sharing\nIt to people all the people on the rights to ... below this one day the entire country should be light we should be high literally binding the person's responsible period\nAnd let me just ask because I've got to think that with if they're able to retrieve all the devices and kind of a take them apart bit by bit um there's gotta be some Easter eggs in there there's gotta be some fingerprints there's gotta be some DNA of a follicle of hair in a minute\nI predict yet they have the basic idea ... from ... um they have all the elements in tact it they can look at a ... inch ... pullout leaves the bushes\nAnd I think you know ... I Would I bet\nIt did it costs the fetus editions one day\nBut I urge Emily ... light behind law enforcement you know he and his country his sort of ... all the active all the bottle dishes terrorism issues terrorism at the heart of television and people have to realize that\nThis latest bomb threat comes in the run up to a midterm election that his way to your than the average mid term the key word for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer impeachment\nOf president has such stress flying Michael good when the New York post the latest including the rally was said Cruz once again with Kevin mckell\nTwenty six team was a long time ago in politics I remember\nBeing at the convention when crews on endorsed Trump in his speech and it was essentially booed off the stage and I thought boy somebody just blow up this political career\nBut here we are two years later and there are ... and uh all as well and and you know when you need each other you're able to overlook a lot of sin but now ... and that's politics as usual\nNow pretty much a listen the president as is working this campaign cycle from my amateur eyes Michael as hard as he would be as if he was running for office themselves\nFirst of all is that a fair assessment secondly isn't going to make a difference are we going to see some momentum growing in the Republican grassroots a congressional races that he's hoping he will be able to turn up the heat on\nWealthier your first point about him running as hard as if he were on the ballot um yeah I think is actually running as as as life depends on it and and it does in a certain sense because if the Democrats\nTake the house or take both Congress says he's going to have his hands full ... he'll have to adapt if they have the house\nOr what we know what a Adam Schiff Jerry Adler and Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi have in store so it's going to be a very difficult ride if they take the Senate as well then it would be extremely difficult for the president [noise] so\nThink that he he clearly recognized is a danger he's been out there three four days a week or putting an enormous energy and time\nAnd yet I think that the significance or or the the question of whether he's helping 'em yes in some in some states more than others in some districts more than others\nBut he has a unique ability\nBeyond what any president does I think to focus the mind on issues right and just as he did with the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process and the political\nCharacter assassination to Democrats carried out on Kavanaugh and now with the caravan of migrants caravan Trump is doing something similar\nI he has it I I Know a unique ability to spotlight an issue with language and emotion\nThat really gets the juices flowing and I believe in both cases accurately show I think he said some things about the caravan that may not stand up in terms of how many middle Easterners and that sort of thing nonetheless if they are able to reach the border\nOr in significant numbers that that says we don't have a border\nAnd I think that is a significant political issue in the mid term to say you have Kavanaugh and the care of them are I think these two issues the president has highlighted are very significant issue is which is why you're seeing the less go crazy attacking him over his comment\nThat is weird is this is it's like this kitten the Caribbean has brought back Trump's number one political issue from twenty sixteen and put it on the front page for him to run on again in twenty eight\nI mean when you have that day one when he announced his campaign in twenty Fifteen I mean that's the day when he talked about\nMexicans not sending their best some of them are rapist that was their wife yeah and that proved to be a very important issue for him and you know Kevin me the immigration issue\nIt cuts across a lot of things I mean certainly impacts American Jobs\nThe economic situation the sanctuary cities but also impacts public safety national security and so it it is an issue that's potent and a lot of different ways and caravan I think is actually helping the president now now I I caution\nSaying we don't know how this story and right if he were to send the military if there were to be violence if the military were to accidentally or even intentionally\nKill people maybe children that would be a pretty horrible situation all around that I think would work against the president but for now is that the threat of the caravan the pictures the\nThe the imagery of those of them crashing through the borders into Mexico and Shane nobody's gonna stop us we're going to the United states that rightfully alarms I think a lot of Americans that we really have lost control of our border\nThis caravan working its way up to our southern border has absolutely highlighted a campaign theme from the twenty sixteen lecture but it has also raised a whole host of question mark strand from am eleven sixty hope for your life in Chicago turn to Glenn door of cedar bill university\nLet's talk about President Trump and this yeah let's just say this is a little difficult problem you've got what this caravan moving this direction so what does he decided to do on Monday he declared that the United states would begin cutting aid to three Central American countries\nThat he says have failed to stop these migrants from ... to the U.S border\nIs that a good policy or are we are partly to blame for the problem where do we go\nYeah it's a it's a very complex is for the\nCaravan again it's really they they knew I deal or that has been formulated in Central America to to send like runs\nI'm In a big whoop or to the United states as a means of a better safety security getting rid of human trafficking or less of the the likelihood of that it started in San Pedro Sula\nIn Honduras which is the major city in the middle of the country a very very high murder rate all kinds of gang problems for example I unemployment and so a lot of people on the she doesn't like flee to trying that United States\nFor better lives are at to that similar problems and Guatemala El Salvador Nicaragua as a socialist president ah or take that are that has clamped down on protests recently\nAnd so from for those four countries in particular people are moving across on jurors to Guatemala that now in Mexico and the U.S house of miles from the border with Texas President Trump is respond within sets a you know you think about the two thousand six being campaign\nIt's a particular challenge to legislators it's a challenge to school administrators it's a challenge to anyone who has to do something as simple as labeled a bathroom male or female for men or women when you're looking at this kind of confusion it filters down every dimension of a society\nThat's why it was big news on Sunday when the New York times broke the story about proposed guidelines dealing with the definition of these issues\nThat would come from within the Trump Administration Monday's edition of the New York times included a front page article by Eric Al Green Katie dinner and Robert pair the headline was ... may limit how government defines

Administration is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological immutable condition determined by Jenna Haley at birth\nThe most drastic moves said the reporters yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protection of transgender people under federal civil rights law and quote\nNow that's the leap paragraph from the New York times but let's work backwards just a little bit but one thing we are told that the proposed guidelines again obtained by the New York times indicate according to the reporters\nThe most drastic move yet in what's described as a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people\nUnder federal civil rights law now wait just a minute what federal civil rights legislation has anything to do with transgender people the answer would be nothing\nBut what is implied in this is the fact that the gangs for the transgender community by administrative action under the Obama administration they are threatened to be rolled back by the definition of these issues under the draft guidelines obtained by the New York times so what's really going on here well the beginning of the paragraph tells us what's going on\nThe Trump Administration we're told is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth\nNow before going any further in the article let's just say what we should all understand\nThat is exactly that is fundamentally that is virtually universally throughout time and throughout space\nHow human beings have defined what it means to be male and female and to be\nTo use the modern language a gender and human being from the beginning of the human experience this is why as we've often pointed out when a baby is born simply looking at the baby there is the almost immediate celebration and a dedication it's a boy or a girl\nThe Trump Administration according to the New York times is considering a definition that will be totally consistent with that\nMost basic human affirmation but you'll notice that that lead paragraph has written as if the Trump Administration has been caught trying to do something that is innovative but of course the Trump Administration if these guidelines are exactly as the New York times reports\nNot doing anything innovative at all it is simply declaring what a rational person to well virtually
