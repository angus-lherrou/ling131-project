Britain left no we'll talk\n[laughter] are you ready\nOkay here we go ah let's finish up our conversation about a print Solomon and or do you think that he knew a as a General Michael Hayden former CIA director and a national uh what was the national security chief\nI I ... the war is being you know ahead of the kingdom the answer is yeah um but because he wielded so much power and because he has done things like insane other princes in charge of that money back that\nHe has a print is that it's in Philly sorted out of the kingdom and spent outside of the game them in a hurry from all up and he put 'em in like house arrest boat tell with Carleton or whatever [noise]\nUm I think there are some that were very afraid of him\nAlthough uh he does have a bodyguard that travels with him um then Solomon does that apparently um was there yeah in Turkey at the climate of this chaos [laughter]\nWe're ... we're ... we're standing there was what twelve no\nYeah yeah we've been able to identify three or four of them but we all know about the other eight or nine of them\nI'm\nNow here's another fascinating thing there is a lobby group in Washington DC that is\nOne by Republican in this Republican\nI'm ... is white occasionally for the Washington Post as well the Washington Post\nWent to this Republican named America does not somebody out or and his lobby group and said you either right for us all you caught lobbying on behalf of Saudi Arabia and\nSaudi Arabia when they only contract that this lobby group but a lot of it was called B GR group um had a hill so lobby for a Kazakhstan and Bahrain whatnot\nIn the lobby group gave up to eighty thousand dollar a month contract with Saudi Arabia does Washington Post really will that kind of power um in order to protect\n'em a Saturday just then which is what his Yogi was me something is just very ... it's just not killing years something very wrong [noise]\nUm yeah I Know I Would say a where the somewhere between Gina Haspel\nThe head of the CIA and light Palmdale obviously who used to be head of the CIA now secretary of state they both know everything there is to know the question is how they told Trump I Would say no they haven't been ...\nUm because ... tend to be a little reckless with his fingers on Twitter\nI'm like you did yesterday when I was actually about Stormy Daniels yeah so I Would say we have to have Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is an ally in the middle east we cannot deny that\nUm so uh in the United states kind of in a position here to clean up after yeah some kind of a mess that was made well there might be some truth to that but I'm Still something about this cat that he had to be eliminated and\nWell I guess eventually and we'll have a clue what that is known about eventually we'll get to the bottom of it it just won't I don't think so and the next day or two or week or whatever\nBut I don't think we will ever know the ... the\nShow in the meantime we're hearing and by the way I heard that rumor again I don't know if it's a rumor rumor but boy you heard it again I did yesterday a on a sale radio network news that a tool of the ah security people had been sent back\nAh to Saudi Arabia to face charges for apparently are causing the deaths of this man they said by a rough interrogation so that's what I heard yesterday\nWe I don't know that there is evidence of all of that that might be just signed a kind of a lawyer tactics that the kingdom has taken an or to shield sure um my mom's been Solomon himself\nUm ... we don't know and I would this point what we're told we don't even know is the truth I mean was this guy truly murdered or is this just they can then things the headlines is coming out of a\nRight to one now you know what I'm saying yeah it's something you know it's not working for me\nAnd the New York times is reporting right now there are five suspects in the ... are tied directly to the crown prince security determining\nYeah and one on the body guards you know\nOkay let's talk about Nikki Haley because of course she's leaving the un ah there's a lot of speculations what she's gonna do next but there are a whole bunch of candidates are are now names being tossed out there to replace her and one of their names are was mentioned was General David Petraeus\nCorrect we talked about that last week we did know I've had some people say is that for real is that really going to happen or is there somebody a stronger genetics you think would be involved\nI have no idea I mean I Know they're the lists that I'm being developed that name and they're on there and pencil and on just because of that name on the left doesn't mean that that person would even except that you all I'm a or that whatever you know advance\nA you know above somebody else so I I don't know no way to heal\nBecause usually with the way they imported a appoint ambassadors of most presidents as they take the fund raisers the people that raised the most money in the

N. double A. because that would have given him a skill he got in right away and made rank and all that stuff and I'll be doggone if it wasn't a civilian contractor I was shocked yeah\nAbsolutely it's it's another one of those sectors of aviation that when you come through nationally Beijing academy that either one of our locations in mass Jew store here in Florida that there is an opportunity out there uh\nThe uh United States military and and foreign militaries have a lot of aircraft and they're looking for skilled labor to maintain them and a lot of times we don't have the active duty personnel to maintain those aircraft so a civilian contractors will do some of that work\nAnd he told me he graduated up there in uh Massachusetts at the Boston campus uh just outside Boston that is a Concord\nAnd die he'd been doing it worked out for a couple of years and he'd been in this state she'd already moved around three different bases are doing contract work but he said now because of what happened there he's probably going to be extended above his contract which is supposed to end the end of the year of January ... January ...\nAnd he said now because of the equipment that's there he expected to stay there longer besides besides that um [noise] uh the uh and and the other thing he told me was because I asked her I said well how many people in your class actually did this he said about eight or ten\nSure about eight or ten went to work for this contracting company and we're scattered around the country so for those individuals\nThat keep we keep talking about the military contractors and I always mention overseas and they're right here in the country yeah\nYes yeah I absolutely uh\nThere there there's a lot of opportunity and one of the things that people tend to think\nIs that when they when they deal with military contracts with government contractors always leaving\nThe mainland us that's not necessarily the case you know there there are many military bases here you know and if for example what just happened in the panhandle yeah ... southern Georgia you know you you can't always get all those aircraft down there\nWhile they didn't have any pilots you know they ran out and I as I asked a young man I said how come those planes that looked like they're perfectly good tied down how come they're still there and they didn't fly out he said we didn't have any pilots yeah wasn't that many but they were twenty chosen those aren't cheap\nNot not not cheap at all and you know\nA regardless if if they looked like the damage or not there's going to have to be an inspection done to make sure the aircraft is air worthy and it's safe to fly\nSo at the very least some mechanics and have to go there and go knows the tunnel looking over make sure it's all in good shape make sure there's no hint damage that nothing went down the ... no no uh no hell damage but you know debris damage on it and and just make sure the aircraft safe to fly\nDo you remember a Hurricane Andrew in home said\nYeah I Am absolutely remembered his\nBase didn't look quite as bad as homestead but where the damage was there it was just destroyed I mean the hangers were gone loud yeah flat and then then the better hangers were out on the runway and they were one of them was like ah out in the middle of a a past your field a guy that good half mile away\nThey'll just move the whole thing up and she can peaches and landed\nYou know like way out of off the base and um I Know they were getting the run while the runway was clear they called the runway because that's where the all the big transport planes recovered for bringing into big what do they see five eight ...\n\nThey were bringing those and and then
