court of appeals was unlike anything we've seen before\nYes we had the ... of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas episode to point back too but this was something much worse\nWe don't need to recap the ugliness of recent weeks but we should note last weekend the Senate confirmed justice cabin I'll buy a boat at fifty to forty eight and he is taking his seat on the court justice Kavanaugh spoke at the White House\nThe Senate confirmation process was contentious an emotional that processes over my focus now is to be the best justice I can be\nI take this office with gratitude no bitterness on the Supreme Court I Will seek to be a force for stability immunity my goal is to be a great justice for all Americans and for all of America\nGreg plugs in of Sri news joined John Hall and Kathy ... onward at them in Pittsburgh Greg this has been painful in every regard but Brett Kavanaugh is actually just doing a job\nRight the first day on the bench shut the Supreme Court\nThere were a couple of oral argument cases ah regarding a prison sentences for for prisoners and uh\nSo he's off and running and there was a very friendly and good spirited a welcome by the chief justice John Roberts inside the courtroom wishing\nThe newest member Kavanaugh oh you know along and happy career on the bench and so you're right this was a sort of a nice day of relief certainly for cabin on for his family for the White House and the president for all of Kavanaugh supporters but it was a brutal and bitter process\nGreg tell us about what the welcome chief justice Roberts looked like\nWell I was not in the room I've I've read news accounts of what happened you know at the beginning before or arguments to get on any cases that are before the justices that the Supreme Court they sometimes will do some business you know ahead of time they'll swearing\nMembers of the bar they'll make other announcements about other pending cases and then they sometimes just you know make these kinds of remarks obviously they weren't knowledge that they are in full Supreme Court mode now nine justices at the ready to hear obviously the Supreme Court went the first week\nOf their fall term with only eight because of the ongoing confirmation battle\nHave any of the justice has weighed in on the Kavanaugh situation\n[noise] yeah it was interesting over the weekend at a previously scheduled event you had justices Kagan and sort of my or um make a joint appearance and I don't remember the name of the conference or the event where they were they were speaking publicly but\nEach of them did raise concerns primarily about the more partisan anger that was expressed by Kavanaugh on the day that he followed a Christine Blasey Ford's testimony [laughter] um I I I don't think that anybody who felt like Kevin hours wrongly accused\nReally fault him for being angry that day although there were some even some who supported him who thought that\nBy mentioning the Clintons and by going after the Democrats in particular that late some questions or concerns about temperament and that's what we heard from ... or and Kagan they they weren't elaborate remarks about that but they did raise that as concerned mhm\nSo talk about the standing ovation and Mitch McConnell got when he left in the proceedings [laughter]\nYeah Mitch McConnell a got a standing ovation I mean it was it was it was a very interesting Germany in that you have the you know you had the fitting eight justices independence there you have the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy so you've got a lot of\nYou know government star power in the room there the Easter I'm I'm Mitch McConnell he and and you have to remember this is this is the hardest and the White House sponsored GOP friendly audience so this is not like just a general audience this was you know\nOne of these are the fan\nExactly it was a it was a friendly room to start with but they looked at McConnell and realize that he's done a couple of things now one is east too strong even though it's been widely reported that Kavanaugh was not his first choice for the president to have made for the vacancy [noise]\nBut then he also lead the way in a very unusual manner and twenty sixteen by not moving forward on President Obama's nominee holding out for the election having Trump ended up winning the election and that of course led the way for Gorsuch so McConnell played a key no very critical role in both of these before\nYou got to give it to him I mean for I mean he has been the two chess master and all that he really has a watching so much of the news\nCoverage over the course of the last few weeks the casual observers or the uproar over justice cannot be led to believe that this frightening conservative jurists would bring politics to the bench in fact the opposite is true [noise]\nKavanaugh and justice Gorsuch before him had the judicial philosophy that seeks to keep the courts as much as possible how the politics conservatives had for decades now been looking for judges who are strict construction is judges that apply the law and understand the constitution as\nThey were written but with history as our guide that hasn't been easy to achieve Albert Mohler provide some historical context for us from his briefing program\nBy the time George W. Bush was elected president of the United states in the year two thousand conservatives had had enough of pledges about the nomination of strict construction is judges they wanted proof that justices who would be nominated by Republicans would actually be strict construction is\nBus even going back to the first decade of the century groups such as the federalist society committed to that very reading of the constitution began to grow in importance and influence\nBut then fast forward not to two thousand nine to two thousand eight but the two thousand sixteen when Donald Trump was running for the Republican presidential nomination\nIn an effort to try to demonstrate to conservatives that he should be supported as their candidate he indicated that he would go to the federalist society for a list of judges whom he might appoint as justice of the United States Supreme court\nIt was a list of somewhere around twenty five justices it has been smaller and greater sense\nThen but the point is that this list which will be made up of judges and legal scholars who had already demonstrated their commitment to originalism and strict construction as him and us then candidate Donald Trump who had previously shown very little interest in the Supreme Court and had one even talked about nominating\nHis sister little liberal federal judge to the United States Supreme court it was then that Donald Trump indicated that he would follow exactly what he had said and he would nominate from that list and only from that list\nWhen President Trump was elected in November of two thousand sixteen he himself subsequent to that election make clear that he believed that the pledge that he had made concerning the Supreme Court was in large part the reason for his election especially for conservative turnout\nThe argument made by many evangelicals and others to support Donald Trump in the two thousand sixteen presidential election a move that was completely out of sync\nWith the kind of candidate that conservative evangelicals that ever supported before the argument was made that the Supreme Court is virtually everything and winning the Supreme Court and actually changing the direction of the Supreme Court was so important\nThat it would justify supporting and voting for a candidate unlike any candidate that evangelicals have supported before especially given the moral and character issues that were involved\nBut what's really important for the sake of history is to recognize that this past weekend is exactly what Donald Trump promised when it comes to the Supreme Court of the United states and it's not only the nominations of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the court that are important\nIf not only the fact that they were both thoroughly vetted in their constitutional interpretation it has to do also with the fact that both of them were completely supported by a White House and made very clear\nThat they would not back off of these nominations even under intense political pressure\nOddly enough the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh is due to one of the most unique partnerships and the history of modern American politics the partnership between\nThe Republican president Donald Trump and the Senator Mitch McConnell the Republican senator from Kentucky who is the majority leader of the United States Senate it took the absolute determination of both men to see the cabin on nomination through\nAnd sources close to both men were very clear that they both understood that it would be a political battle royal to confirm any nominee\nWho would come to the seat that had been occupied by Anthony Kennedy the understanding was that the cultural left would fight it with everything\nAnd that it would take an equal determination in order to gain a successful confirmation process\nJust moments after the Senate voted to confirmed judge Kavanaugh Robert Barnes writing for the courts of law called them at the Washington Post began his report with these words the capital of court will be the one conservatives have worked for decades to construct experts say\nWith velocity the only question about the Supreme Court's advance to the right end quote now here's where we need to understand that when the Washington Post in the column like this talks about the court advancing to the right\nConservatives would come back and say no it's not advance into the right it is just returning the court to a motive constitutional interpretation that was implied and required by the constitution was ratified they're not trying to take the court back to Nineteen forty nine they would argue they're trying to take the court back to Seventeen eighty nine\nBut for so many of the important cases that will come before the Supreme Court the magic number isn't five five would be a majority of justices burned opinion is rather than number for that is the number of justices required for the Supreme Court to agree to take a case issue what in the language of the court is called a ... a search your E N\nWere not going to do anything to compromise the safety of pastas daughter and others like her\nI I didn't think when I

the department of education office of civil rights and we were encouraged to see that the federal government is taking a look at this and launching an investigation into the school district because their concern is not only is you know this is\nA dangerous policy but they the school district may have violated federal law\nBy adopting this policy not responding appropriately to to what happened in and creating a hostile environment for boss's daughter and and other young girls at this school so that's a bright light and all of this is that we now have a federal government that's taking these issues seriously and so we're going to continue to work\nThroughout that investigatory process uh but at the end of the day what we're wanting is a good policy in place wounded ensures something like
