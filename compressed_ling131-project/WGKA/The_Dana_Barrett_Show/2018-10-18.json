line right now we've got Dan demand in Lafayette, Indiana right just freezing or just ... they're\nGonna hit thirty to thirty one than I thought about it for a crime you know I'm ill it'd be I don't think it'll be up to tell the grass yet but law the leaves are starting to trade\nYou know and you said you already had snow up there at least once\nYeah it came down for about an hour it didn't stick it melted but I mean it was big wet quarter sized like that was last friday okay I uh tested my son I said it's thirty two I'm smelling heritage that's too bad that it's a funny in eighty two here in Beirut and yet\nYeah Tom though but no I heard that when you're done for said a lot of the marine corps correct\nUm I think when we get out of Afghanistan I think they're going to turn their attention to China and the Taliban because of the leaders ... which are Islamic and that was always something that China worried about\nUh you know they got a concentration camps up to him a million ... right now\nThat's one of our foreign policy Trump cars if we ever had to play one would be the on the ... and I think that you would see the Taliban and ISIS start training on arming the waivers in western China but something most people never even heard of but that could be their Achilles' heel\nAnd as far as the Chinese Navy goes by God they're they're building carriers with old Russian technology moves a slow death\nI got they got to get volunteers pilots to fly off those things and you can you can only really why I'm In the daytime\nBecause you're not going to land on one of those things at night with a deck like that they're there they never were very effective [laughter] you know the the Russians are up several like that when they tried to show horse off of\nOff the poster Syria they had to get pub boat couldn't even go under its own power ... that carrier so\nI'm not I I Would love to the Chinese Navy yard because no two ships are the same you know they bought a lot of old Russian old Ukraine old Arjun pine old Indian ships\nAnd it ... it would be amazing to see how they keep those ships to blow to look at it looks impressive but I think under battle condition I don't think we'd have much of a problem with Chinese Navy right now they can't even get one of those carriers to go around the globe without breaking down and they don't even tried it yet\nNo that's one of the things that do\nThey probably wonder you know with Obama United States go back to the Obama foreign policy you know but your glasses back on because you know because we want to you know a take them off because we don't you don't want to see you in blurred vision yeah we want you know so I I think that\nWhat the Chinese right now I have enough internal problems I don't really see can be much of a problem for a while no good long while they were smart about it\nOther than the south China Sea and building on I don't think the United states is going to have much of a problem with them but I Wish when we go freedom of navigation instead of sending a a destroyer I Wish we could spend a couple of destroyers crews are carriers\nThere there's a lot of the ... we don't need to go like well we'll maybe function\nWell we keep 'em we we keep sending are bigger ships over there I think we've put an aircraft payload grow breakthrough there while back\nBut we need a couple more battle group

captain's America third watched dot com that's the captain's America third watch dot com will join us right now from the founders code dot com website Denise Simon hello Denise Simon how are you going on and\nLet's talk about Hillary because we started out talking about the Treasury Department employee who got caught with a flash drive would God Knows how much information there but now we're hearing that a mistake\nAnd that provided clearly false statements and shock to a federal judge who was looking into all this stuff with the a document requests that have been made by I Believe Tom fitness group or is that correct\nWell what happened what ended up really happening here was that there was an inspector general [noise] and then the inspector general's report or it came out that\nThere were allies and I'm affidavit that had ball data in it um about coughing up documents coming out of the state department regarding Hillary uh Cheryl Mills and the others I'm On the on the case of her email server\n[noise] now the case had already gone before this judge and\nFortunately the judge ruled the right way the first time and then um when evidence because of the continuing lawsuit than judicial watch has um the inspector general's report was added\nAnd so the consequence uh the judges just blown away by the allies and what not in the mean any that are Cheryl Mills got\nNow because of the ball vacation a the affidavit the coughing up the document\nThere may be and we don't notice it and if there isn't there should be um it would make the immunity first Cheryl Mills null and void\nUm because obviously there was some kind of a cooperation a collaboration or even possibly collusion or conspiracy um between the state department\nAnd Hillary's operate in including Hillary herself on coughing up these documents so we'll see where that necessarily goes interestingly enough\nIt including going back as far as Ben gossipy mhm though I'm someone could be very interesting\nWell now I'm with the drilling of the document requests you if you will because that's way Fox has reported um what can we expect next from this year we're going to a ... and you're going to get involved in Michigan are we going to get a little deeper into this you're what's gonna happen\nWell we don't know um it depends upon what the judge ultimately does um so I think we'd have to necessarily check competing over judicial watch\nTo see what he reports coming out of this whole thing um okay uh you know they may\nNow I Believe that and yet another judge has granted approval to judicial watch to bring in Hillary for testimony\nA fun Hillary to be given to a judicial watch ... now I think that was scheduled for next week but I'm not convinced I have that one right\nOr no one's talking about Crimea because suddenly that's back room and thrown back into the mix\n[noise] well yesterday there was apparently a small college in um\nCrimea ah on the black sea region where Nineteen people were killed Nineteen students won't kill\nNot only what gunfire but apparently with some kind of ... now I'm putting this coming out and saying well he doesn't blame Harris says mass murder well I'm not sure that there\nGoes I Do use are kind of tells Richard ... well\nI mean there were obviously some kind of incendiary bomb devices that they're speaking do or whatever else you call one of the un I date right\nThat's correct um so\nAll it was an absolute panic not only did they kill Nineteen but\nA whole pile of them were also injured\nA kind of does is it a little college I'm a ...\nLane on that yet I Love it really matter what it anyway\nUm but [noise] you know the troops were sent in El personnel carriers all sense of the theme parents went in to collect their\nKid on that goal in other schools in case this was why you know going to go even further can um you know some other educational facilities right so I wouldn't say that hey\nYou know everything here in the United states is ... ... oh I Would say this is a big deal on what happened in Crimea\nAnd the fact that there was such a tepid response by putting where Nineteen students are killed so um I think that in itself on these major headline that just doesn't think debate is crazy\nWell you know those are the exact you try and do that but uh we haven't talked about what goes on over in Iran or in a while and apparently us warships operating in the Persian Gulf or know regularly over flown by Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles\nThat correct adding a brand new wrinkle to the operations in the region and why are we alone in them to do this I Would never opted for viruses in charge of their trip they wouldn't be over my ship\nOkay well um I Would say somebody\nIn the navy and somebody in the Pentagon needs to um ... ... ... you know get some permission to\nHandle that situation maybe we are just watching it very carefully maybe we're seeing that\nYou know they're an armed they're there for surveillance they may be just another cowboy tactic that the Iranians are doing in the Persian Gulf we don't know mhm um but we we can practice electronic warfare and we have them fall out of this

America Africa and chose a republic for which than than one nature nation under God\nIndivisible with liberty and justice for all and ladies and gentleman we emphasize the two words under God that great combination of words signifies the\nFounding of our country on Judeo Christian values well\nRon we've had an interesting case since yesterday all kinds of things going on but of all things that we have to hear about why can't Hillary Clinton and the state department and all this Google doc go away because once again the state department according to a federal judge\nClearly clearly provided false statements which even shock the inspector general report that was put out there I mean what are we going to when are we going to learn here that I'm Hillary and her\nHer group of ah marry men and women just\nCan't be trusted\nAlly they absolutely cannot be trusted in it but we're going to continue to learn more and more details I Believe because of this stuff went on for quite a while there are various activities and it's kind of like a drip drip drip uh they they just stuck them come out [noise]\nBut uh you know things happen in the investigation wrap up to look into the joy\nOr you're going to be going even more um a thing going on and uh I I still believe that eventually even Mrs collect oil um kept on the show about the long arm of the law\nThat dream on my friend let's talk about let's talk about one of the things here that did happen yesterday which is hard to believe the dramatic arrest of a\nOne of the treasury department's own you know do you remember a member of the Treasury Department and all those wonderful things so they did to the Tea Party groups remember all that\nI remember that yeah Ali Obama's yeah\nWell Natalie Maynes flower showers Edwards forty years old a senior official at the departments financial crimes enforcement network is accused of illegally giving a reporter bank reports documenting several suspicious financial transactions\nIsn't that just ducking and what they were trying to do was she had a flash drive\nThat she was carrying with information that ah she'd pill for information I'm from the uh\nFor the department of treasury trying to get information about Paul Manafort the former remember him the former Trump campaign chief campaign official Richard Gay Sunday accuse Russian agent Maria Butina ah they were trying to get whatever information they couldn't\nIt was going to um some reporters who were of course not using it for all I don't know to a correctly report anything\nWell you've got the un identified a treasury colleague also cited in court or as a co conspirator with the news was whether it works or however they were not charged\nFor you know we're both street it was ...\nYeah and the person that identified only as an associate director of fence and who met which record exchange more than ... hundred messages\nA with a report it via this kind of what the answer was an encrypted ... message application\nAnd um you've got a chance thousands and thousands of ah SARS along with the thousands of other files containing a lot of sensitive government as a nation\nAnd she ... they really got into the book of these people are um because um\nWhat kind of damaging stuff um how are they dealing with here I mean you're dealing with in government information I mean he's got these people are playing around like they're like totally wings or something [noise] um but um I just I just\nBelieve that uh [noise] you know there was highly sensitive and cremation of material relating to Russia Iran mhm and um the Islamic state a terrorist group also\nAnd so you got a lot of stuff or information here and I'm a lot of trouble here\nAll right well we're moving we're moving along rapidly here because there's something else it popped up this morning it's a story that really bothers the heck out of me remember the a duck boat or a a accidents that happen in Branson, Missouri and Seventeen people drowned remember that\nI think they they they they said that um well yeah but oh wait a minute to fifty one law\nYeah no wait a minute why did you hear this from the two companies facing multiple lawsuits after the sinking of a duck boat in July to result in Seventeen does cited in Eighteen fifty one maritime law that would limit or eliminate their liability in a tragedy\n[noise] that you know\nWell there is such a law now okay there is such a large called the ... owners limitation of liability act that limits the damages to the salvage value of sunken vessels\nYeah and they got to deny negligence and and the thinking of a boat and the Missouri lake near a branch\n'em\nBut however should the court find them responsible their liability is zero because of all was a total law and has no harm value\nThe law known as as you stated the ship owners limitation liability act limit damages to salvage a value of sunk in the ghetto or if it's it's it's not worth anything I guess that reduces [noise]\nUm well ability of remember\nThe ship captain that did the buzz around the islands and take it was in Greece any role of the ship over the cruise ship remember that oh yeah\nYeah well the same thing happen over there with the same law as ... financial responsibility of the steam ship blind or over there I remember all the stuff that went on I remember the same sort of thing happens so they're trying to do the same thing with the duck boat but I think they're going to find themselves in a different circumstance well see\nI hold that thought alright folks will be right back with
