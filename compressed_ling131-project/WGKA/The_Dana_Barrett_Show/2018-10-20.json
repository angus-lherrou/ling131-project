TV Time machine we welcome currently crave outside swipes ms ... used to tell the actress and writer who's appeared in such films as whole pass and the Three Stooges and such TV series those hello

thank you for coming on board the TV Time machine thank you for having\nMe I'm excited to be here now you're the greeter show runner in store of the new original scripted series side swipe no visible on YouTube Premium Hurley told us what size why does all about\nI think that it's a comedy I Need to get that that that that it's tackling dating and the digital era and then it's going to deal with relationships but romantic and all because you don't see my mom is played by more than our cat also dating um she's in her fifties and widowed\nI'm living with my character and starting her life over for the first time and killing on a dating app and then you have my younger sister again who's in her twenties you the millennial\nIt'll kind of leading by Israel you know she got married before thirty has a kid but now it's sort of feeling like that seven year itch and her marriage and getting a little bit bored and wondering if she made the right and and it's living vicariously to our character as we're having fun\nSo tell us about your character Olivia what kind of person who she\nShe tight and the beginning she works in insurance is doing really well\nI'm without a relationship for the last few years she had a five year why not you know after she got out she just went over to our work and didn't date and had done really well and so now she's starting her doctor and getting on tinder after she goes to the gynecologist ... played by ... where he tells her that\nAt thirty five that they are starting to dry out and if they ever want to have kids or anything it better you know like he he kinda got to get started on at least dating um which is a lot I think I think that women here in the thirties and there is such a thorough there on tender and um he decides to date olive matches and you'll see her kind of start opening up\nAnd becoming a different person away all of them have big ark\nWell she has two hundred and fifty two matches so yeah since Olivia do is kind of doing the ultimate in speed dating or are you assume that not every day there's a home run is how is the case\nAnd also she's not always the home run you know what I mean like I feel like that's a big part of dating is\nIowa is the you know that like drink too much or I was one that was a very in a day sometimes it right in the first episode you'll see that she's the one that the the hot now\nUm and it's not a data that we shall we say it's not like you'll see a different date every week and then you know we're going to go on to entertain you haven't had a really not that it just the jumping off point of the show but the show is really a grounded\nIt's about life more than it is about just hinder dating and these relationships between the mom and sister\nUm that I think a lot of people will find related bowl and a lot of it's based on my own experiences in life whether it be with dating or just embarrassing things like the gynecologist office that thing happened to me I'm so you'll see a lot of that stuff brought to life where it's kind of cringe worthy comedy sometimes [laughter] but I Love to watch\nSo when do you think that many matches with Olivia learned about human beings and what does she perhaps ... so\nYeah I mean that's that's really the message is is\nYou know she's not at the end of the day she not out looking for Mr Right to save the day and come in and you know live happily ever after I'd like to get the message across that you know you're going to even experience all these things in life but really the most important thing is she's figuring out who she is\nAnd what she loves that if somebody gets into that part you know naturally than great but it's these three women kind of figuring out who they are at the later stages in life\nUm and and how important that is and how much it affects you if you bring somebody in and get married and make that\nEverything to you what happens like right on and when her husband dies she's left with nothing you know she had no skills he's never had a job and she has to come up with my character\nAnd I and so a big part of it is just you know as women I think we're we're taught as kids like the print Saturday live happily ever after any find your print and all that stuff and it's just it's so much more about know figure out who you are you know do your thing they got what makes you happy and if somebody fits into that great\nYou mentioned the ... mom Mary she's old dating\nYeah play by rather than our cat is amazing\nThe fact of the ... something in common is that India does that enhanced their relationships are they become closer his mother and daughter\nIn certain ways to die than in certain ways that it it you know a makes it worse because your mom and dating and she's living with her and her she's a little bit like a teenager you know what I mean she's like I said she never had a jobs they're going to see her\nGet a job for first time like figure out what it's like to be independent and Olivia their role to reverse where Olivia is more like the mom and she's like the kid so and how that affects Olivia when she really just\nNeeds a mom you know like it and that sort of based on like when my mom was single and her fifties they're very different my mom's very independent but the idea that um\nThat that when you're when she's doing that and I kind of to become your friend as opposed to your mom and how that affects the relationship I always found that really interesting and I bring that into their relationship\nTo you mentioned the rules and of course is your ... was it like working with her\nIt was really fun I mean she's a proud she's been doing this forever and she's so good\nAnd honestly it was perfect for the role like as soon as her name was brought up everybody we were just trying to think who would who would be good for this role you know somebody in their fifties that embodied all of these characteristics are good at least play them and she was she was dead on and when we met her\nShe just was game to do anything so that was awesome and and had her own ideas I wanted to bring menopause into this world you know what I mean like what it's like to be going to ... on that really funny and interesting and sad\nI'm so she was great I mean the fact that he was gay to do everything it's a very vulnerable role that I think a lot of actresses would have trouble playing that she\nTook on end did have challenges but but handled them really well and I think now that in the end\nRight now you mentioned that size why is the least partially autobiographical so humble shoveled Livio is truly you\n[noise] you know it's it's it's based on parts of me you know but it's not it's not like it's definitely not an autobiography it's not I'm not just like\nPlaying myself exactly there's a lot of things about her that maybe are things that I went through before that she still having to go through or they're loosely based on even like other people that I Know that I'll bring into the character but I always at the core of it almost every character I write has a piece of me and I'm\nI'm so so there's that but it's definitely not an autobiography um I don't I you know I'm not\nAs uptight as her and closed minded as she is you know there are there are big pieces of of me that are in there for sure\nSo personally when it comes online dating your view water some of the positives and and we'll just some of the news\nWell negatives I think it's you know there's a lot there's a lot of choice and I think it makes people\nWill you know like if it makes it hard people to settle down like they do like somebody then there'll be like but what else is out there because there is something else out there you know there's a little you can go home and and go to bed and get your phone out and start swiping on more people and have two more days the next day if you want\nSo I think that that can be a little bit of a negative it ... it it it makes it where people it's hard to connect I mean not that that in the show it's easy to match hard to can act I think that's a big problem but positives are I went on there\nAnd had all those two hundred and fifty two matches in real life and I met my boyfriend who I've been with for over two years so I think you know if you can just kind of sift through and when you find somebody that's worth it and great stop and take it in and connect it can be really amazing 'cause I wouldn't have met him otherwise\nRight and you know we think the way that you know the forefront of a mountain and say well I think today [laughter] you can't judge people by a stand outside I\nThink you know you have to take place people in that time to understand why they why they ... they don't want they did or did what they did but like I said everybody has to eight everybody had a family everybody was worried about staying alive\nIt's the same major consensual way kind of human\nAnd Andrew working people find out more about secrets on line\n[noise] um well really sniffing in Charles how are you can also go to our website that you think oh just one more time than the previous ... it's
