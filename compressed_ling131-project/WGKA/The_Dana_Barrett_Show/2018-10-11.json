second person that died and was an eleven year old girl a tree fell on her house and that was in a seminal Georgia to go along with the man in Florida that was killed\nA with a tree fell on his house so that's to people so far that have died as a result of this a hurricane now tropical storm sixty mile an hour winds approaching a Augusta, Georgia headed towards Raleigh North Carolina now I'm so much going on in the world in which we live\nThis limousine and we've had several people asking me questions is was a terrorism what's the guy the Pakistani what's this about being a murder blah blah blah blah but this this shit he lets the mere fact and make shame for pronounce his name ... Hussein has said it was All right\nAll right uh a terrorist recruiters some people are calling them owner of the deadly New York when will company and his son have now been arrested following this crash so tell us in\nWell he's got Paris recruiter he became an informant 'em and he'll get it out of clean Gail I'm where he had actually got in your some ah for trouble earlier but the FBI\nAnd a plea deal that OK well lessen your hair we need you to ban are forming\nIn fact he and one of his buddies um\nHelped on two particular cases where they weren't gonna there with a cat or about a fire bombing in Senate guy in some other things but um so that was a long time ago by the way they started this whole prior to the ... when a company um\n... when a company and you know they obviously didn't comply to any of the ally in and around having a a limo operations\nAnd this particular vehicle with a second vehicle that within out on this particular job the first one pale 'em\nAnd they went back to the garage with the first one or more bought out second wind transferred all the passengers ended the second one\nNo let me let me stop you for a second the second when they brought out had been put out a service by the New York ...\nYou're right they say that go ahead because what they did what they kept I think it was some kind of like an expedition that they got yeah yeah\nGet extended it yeah I'm not terribly uncommon when it comes to stretch vehicle mhm um but it had the same issues apparently or many of the thing is you the first one and some of the passengers had actually sent text messages\nThat point the craft and like oh my God this is Glen ... the actor and blah blah blah blah\nWell I'm so ... of them had been put out a survey but the owners didn't really care they weren't complying mhm\nI'm now the driver interesting laying out he was not life can be right up behind the wheel of a limo right about what the word is only I think two years ago he had been arrested\nA couple of times on narcotics targeted toward God on her so\nAnd I think it was somewhat of a family affair if you will that ... that's when a company that they've now been arrested and charged I'm with the death of a twenty\nPeople well one of the questions I got was could this be terrorism because there was a marine and ... and ... on board and er he was they\nEven yeah I don't think that he was an act it Murray and I think he lived a former marine and um [noise]\nBut I Know I don't think this terrorism I think this is at yeah they are Pakistani a that had um I don't I'm not you can then they were even us that natural I said\nYeah that's the way on that's been rumored that's been rumored\nWe don't know that yeah adult um\nBut um no I think that's the way they operate you\nKnow in their own country and that kind of way that they could operate air\nOkay and um the other thing um with all of this is the fact that once you put a vehicle out of service a deal and she does that they have to come back and they have to re inspect the vehicle and sign off ensure defied the vehicle it's good to go and this guy just merely took the vehicle hopped in in ... all the when\nThe country so the violation for that is a really really really strict and I mean twenty people died uh he doesn't his insurance company doesn't have enough money to pay for all this is just my thought\nI don't know that the insurance company and I cannot think\nSupposed to have a million dollars worth of insurance on a you know to drink minimum to do this sort of stuff and again you need to have a CDL to drive anything more than what is this more than ten passengers they had what twenty in their ... each\nWay wrong which was Eighteen and that was that beyond capacity that vehicle or actors I think it was right after twelve correct\nUnbelievable hide well the other thing that's going on here as we found out yesterday from the international Rescue Committee and Yemen\nThat uh the
