I don't know if he was one of the gang of Fifteen or whatever the hell that was the showed up there but the link to the disappearance of the uh\nUh ... individual who died in a suspicious car accident yesterday\nWell it depends on\nUh who you talk to a in Saudi Arabia but my Shaw I'm Michelle I'm said I'll bust Donny who is a member of the Saudi royal Airforce or he wouldn't name by the pro government Turkish media is one of the Fifteen men that\nI'm a the of the Saudi circle that apparently killed a\n... a died in a car accident in Saudi in Riyadh uh-huh um\n[noise] no yeah now as they also say that car accidents are I guess common yeah in in a Riyadh which is a little on the we're excited me yeah I'm ... to\n... there's there's a little [laughter] I mean we didn't just keep adding to the ... I mean this is kinda like becoming a whole Perry Mason gotten a story bull yeah\n[noise] um but interesting enough to um apparently there is some operation to blame could keep the blame off the royal family ah into themselves that um\nThey're going to offend sleep pin this on a two star general who is part of a new intelligence network mhm that was created by the Saudi I'm a kingdom and his so I'm ... apparently\nAll these diplomats that all get together in Washington and what not um are are wanting to have him in the fall guy general Ahmed el a theory\nIs he the job guys it's banned most other of his daughter of a turkey\nHe didn't tell well he is intelligence and yeah I'm so well he was promoted I'm\nInto Saturday intelligence by the crown prince sense I think last year but he's also been a leading waging the war in Yemen um so it looks like\nA the he might be the fall guy rightly so we don't know I'm again we\nWhatever Yogi was about he had to be it had to be bad enough to kill you know and and to first Saudi Arabia to suffer such a global\nUm criticism of of this whole thing so uh we were clearly not at the end but you know what's kind of amazing to me is I suppose it could ... death is only a big deal because he lived in ... in Virginia\nRight had gone to the University in Indiana three of us for kids were born in America right or he worked for the Washington Post I mean journalists I mean if you want to go after journalists and the death of journalists and I would say look how many are dead and from Mexico you know right [laughter]\nSo it it can is a really surprises me why this one is such a big big big big deal\n[noise] speaking of Mexico has a little caravan doing well not little as four thousand people know\nIt is but um I notice that are getting poor my palm pay I'll get back from turkey that he left a yesterday\nHeading to Mexico City [laughter] well\nYeah so um he he got white back on an airplane and he's headed to Mexico or I'm going to Mexico to say I did a and to their officials and their government here here's the deal\nI'm now several airplanes a Mexican airplane had um Mexican police slash Mexican military on them and they were flown and dispatched\nTo various locations the border between I think Guatemala and Mexico or in order to either one stop pushback or handle this situation\nI think one of the things ... and it's a fabulous one came from the United states to Mexico that says here's the deal will even help you pay for but we need to put some kind of eight\nEight ten temporary housing city in Mexico instead of the you know we do it here in the United states\nWill pay for it to happen in Mexico these people want asylum or refugee status as soon as they leave their home country and they ended up in Guatemala where they end up in Mexico\nThen they have satisfy their own asylum refugee ... you know demand you know what I'm saying you um and so apparently we're willing to help\nConstruct or want a a housing operation in Mexico instead of the year in the Knight state thank goodness somebody's thinking\n[noise] okay [noise] yeah and those are good to shore right give somebody a second year because uh you know the show whole ... well there's one\nThing is about well it's about timing and you know this operation was gone so we have yet another\nScandal likely had a couple of months ago right white up against the mid term election right and um that is precisely what they're trying to\nFinesse that that whole the whole plot in and pull off the way that somebody wanted to fold off yeah but the reason they were arrested\nBark toll of ... in Guatemala who was you know the the architect and well one of the architects and the leaders of this particular caravan\nYeah and by the way the president should definitely weren't able to reach an agreement with Mexico he would go over to the U.S military to close or so long\nThe borders and it's as bad and kill itself is not\nA scandal they'll have to laugh

air force base in the panhandle all they were talking about well maybe this was a blessing in disguise because we're going to close bases and they might closed ten dollars a result of the fact that it's a state all the damage what are you hearing\nA\nTen dollar not on the list for any kind of base closure in fact I think with the money that has gone into the Pentagon we weren't doing any base closures um but I Know that they have brought in\nA huge number of military personnel from other bases are in the handle to begin to restore some infrastructure that certainly would include or systems and the power systems including\nUm suing because at that got destroyed to um to slowly rebuild if there's any truth to what Senator Bill Nelson has to say he said it will absolutely be rebuilt [noise]\nSo um how he can say that with all confidence I don't know\nMe neither I don't think it's I don't know that it's his decision\nI think it's probably more Pentagon or that they would do kind of a joint base kind of thing like it happened in San Antonio because we've got other bases and I know that area\nSo um we're we will necessarily see what happens now what I think there were seven\nMay like more than that made been twelve twenty kids that were damaged or significantly um\nI saw a half dozen\nThat reason they weren't damaged significantly is because they were not quite
