Senators are\nFrom the foreign intelligence committee as well as a teen additional ... senators are sent a letter\nAsking the president to enforce\nThe Magnitsky rule what's that\nOkay I've written on a like a um they'll several times Magnitsky Sergei Magnitsky was a lawyer now dead by the way the Russian lawyer that worked for Bill Browder\n[noise] and uh in order to\nIt's a very long complicated story but I'm Bill Browder\nUm was an investor at the time right after the Soviet Union broke up and he went in to Russia inland buying up companies because they were that they were selling off for like next to nothing ... anyway um [noise] I don't want to have\nHe wanted to rebuild the wealth in this and that is so anybody that was coming in from the outside it was doing like what Bill Browder was doing he was going after them long story short\nThey accused bill Browder footing the bill Browder an awful lot of things\nAnd uh the yard the lawyer Magnitsky he found out a bunch of stuff he ended up dying in prison I'm so we have an act called the Magnitsky Act where we go find where whatever money illegal money's\nI'm ... around the world who met Nick he actors impact in several countries now and so the United states could possibly the Magnitsky Act I'm an ... ... ...\n... it's also important to understand that a pastor wants and now it's part of the way diplomatic talks could go on a wider discussion and that is\nUh getting him back in exchange for completing weapons sales or requests to turkey mhm um because turkey because aired on his behave the way he had we had to spend it all the things\nI'm now what particularly interesting and I think people need to understand is that a\nPastor Brunson is not the only one after or American being held in detention in Turkey okay I'm a little disappointed that the Trump Administration is not mentioning that we got about a dozen Americans that are being jailed in Turkey\nAnd we have an average anything about that\nThat's right and pastor Brunson is one of them they actually another pastor there too by the way\nYou've been there longer\nUm it it's hard to tell because there's limited information on\nAll of

and everybody was hating on Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell's crowding payments so far\nOr a crowning achievement has banned the fact that these nominees that have come through to a film judge said in various courts across the country and then the Supreme Court\nIn all of his doing 'em and I think that he\nThat that really speaks to I think um where his current and he he was really hit it speaks to his achievement and he was concentrating on that I'm probably more than any other thing as as a leader in the Senate so um\nWe have to get a hearing ... hip\nTo McConnell now here's a sidebar to all

that and that's wonderful story\nTo record for the geo peace so are you happy with the job Mitch McConnell's donors Senate majority leader\nI'm very pleased right now I think are our leadership stepped up and supported the president and getting some things done and that's encouraging to all of us\nWell senator I got news for you I'm all about breaking news in the middle of the night that's what we do here in this program and uh I Wish more of the Republican leadership would listen to what we're saying because\nHad David Jolly listening to us last year he might have still been in Congress number one\nHad ... Baker listen to us he might have been the mayor of St Pete number two but for some reason the GOP the grand old party has ignored those of us on the overnight shift which is called the third watch for a reason when the work in America gets done\nWell and that's up to that's why it's so in order and the message you're delivering\nThe list are so they can call and notify their congressman and there are senators but what's important and what's breaking loose and uh they're\nAware of I think that the Americans taking a shift it's waking up and it's a we're all very concerned about retaining America we were given and that's why I Want and hurt 'em lectures right now\nAnd let's talk about elections because right here in Florida we've got our governor Rick Scott who to me I'm just does just such an amazing job\nUh especially when you get ... to get down and dirty like right now in the midst of this hurricane and people don't understand and I do because having been a first responder and having worked with estate search teams I understand the way the protocol works we already had stuff in position ready to go before the storm ever made landfall\nYes our governor has shown exceptional leadership um I was ... all of that we've never had a giant hurricane just sit down on top of the whole state you did an incredible job of managing the situation and he's doing the same thing with what we now see is the strongest hurricane that they're right at the coast of Florida\nAnd other and the third most powerful storm in the country you hit us ship ...\nAnd we're going to need a lot of help getting these folks back on their feet but at least it's a section of horror instead of the entire state which is where he dealt with with um a\nA but it is severe and we're very concerned and sending helped our friends a lot of this can be done through community three to ... communities up particularly communities of fate and I know a lot of help is headed there way we're going to help them rebuild\nMhm [noise] well emergency services are carried out dozens of rescues are people caught by the\nUs swiftly moving floodwaters are of course the surge that came in people that didn't heed the warnings to get out we do have seven confirmed dead right now um killed by the storm ... Florida Georgia and North Carolina we've got three hundred\nPeople listed as missing up there in Bay county\n[noise] well and that's why it's so important we pay attention to these early warning about evacuating a you know the governor took some criticism that maybe we over a back you waited last time with armor that you cannot move these people after things started happening\nAnd it's unfortunate that many people did not take this one seriously 'cause we are able to give people warning at this point\nAnd get them on the move but there's a lot of damage there are a lot of people's lives taken that affected and it's going to take all of us reaching in there and make sure that this recovery is complete\nNow senator can you stick around for another segment\n... odd because one I'm going to do
