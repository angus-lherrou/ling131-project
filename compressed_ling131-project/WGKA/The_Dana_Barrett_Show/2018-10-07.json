partisan politics looked like a playground stage before the eyes of the country this week ugly uncaring crash do come near to what transpired in the new phase of judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing it was an effort in a new sort of ... the as soon as I argued over at the Washington Post this week\nThe Democrats will ultimately share the credit proceeding to ruin the lives of Brett Kavanaugh and his family and likely is accuser Christine Blasey Ford Elite media outlets said their part in the facilitates the allegations in the Washington Post and the New Yorker and then it was something of a free for all\nOne qualified legal observer professor Alan Dershowitz retired now from Harvard law school a wife along liberal now moving somewhere near the center laid waved to the Democrats cynical miscarriage of this confirmation proceedings my colleague Dennis Prager took a closer look\nLet me read to you from Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz\nAnd his description of what was happening\n... denies the appointment it will be because he has been depicted as a sexual predator who deserves contempt origin impossible imprisonment\nHe may no longer be able to teach law coach sports or expect to be treated respectfully she could be forced to resign his current traditional position because having the court convicted unquote rapist on the benches unseemly\nFor these reasons you know has the right perhaps metal legal rights butter rights based on fundamental fairness to have the charges against him put to the test of clear and convincing evidence or some standard close to that\nA judge Kavanaugh been rejected an ideological professional grounds before the sordid accusations were leveled she could go back to his life Robert Bork did but if the Senate fails to confirm him now his life\nWe'll never be the same but this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice is about the most fundamental issue affair on issues of fairness this country has faced since the McCarthy Era\nThe American civil liberties union stood strong against McCarthyism by demanding due process and hard evidence but the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote be resolved against the accused nominee\nPut we mail living in the age that risks a new form\nOf sexual McCarthyism we must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism liberal Democrats Harvard law professor darker than McCarthy's\nEven know if you read the report of Rachel Mitchell for women who seems to have asked you know very on challenging questions\nThe wall Street Journal published her entire analysis I can only provide bunny assessment of Dr Ford's allegations in a legal context and the legal context here's my bottom line a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this case is even weaker than that\nThis is from Rachel Mitchell ate a prosecutor of sex crimes tucked the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate though\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee member nor do I believe is evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence then to understand the difference folks\nThere there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt but outside of the legal world all you need is the ... I think in the ... from mistaken in civil suits\nThe preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just for ... but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\nThe Republicans seem to show absolutely fairness of the accuser and giving deference to the wavering members in his own caucus delayed the confirmation one vote\nWeek as the FBI made it official inquiries\nAs a mid week I spoke with the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice\n[noise] now if in fact we get word that the FBI has done and that should all centers will have the report it's okay to file the notion of culture because that says thirty hours of debate people will have plenty of time to read the report\nThat's right under the Senate rules are there will be at least a an intervening day or the other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cloture vote wouldn't be until the following day so there'll be plenty of time for centers to read the FBI's a supplemental background investigation\nSenator I represented the victim of the sexual assault on a major college campus I catch a more because of confidentiality I'm very sympathetic to victims because the institution of America has not yet adopted to deal with these but that they're changing nevertheless I'm a lawyer like you and I know one\nThe fear of flying there that that was given to the committee that simply wasn't true it wasn't given by her I was getting by the lawyers her ex boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she is familiar with polygraphs inconsistent with their testimony testimony and this is a lawyer deal\nCould not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one that could be disproven that's\nVery rare and then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there problems whether testimony\nWhile there are some allies of well a ritual Mitchell uh was retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um and I thought that are very professional job\nBut I thought she got the basic facts out demonstrated that there are gaps I understand the victims of of trauma can have memory lapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after thirty five years but I just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that uncorroborated\nAllegations should be enough to condemn or a nominee\nSo let's go to the last issue which is Jerry nabbed lower the incoming chairman of how to share a committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays he will hold each month proceedings I say bring those on cars they will be laughing stock about Seventy rule I just got into it she said Brett Kavanaugh wide I said he absolutely did not lie about drinking he did not lie about devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a senator\nWell I think it's this has gotten a a ridiculous absurd we're talking about in prison as high school yearbook whether he threw ice on somebody\nAt some point in the past um I think they've been unsuccessful and attacking the judges credibility and feel like a now they're all from this wild goose chase and uh the goalposts has five friend the majority leader who likes to say uh after a continued to move a but it's time to vote\nHere's what Lindsey Graham said on Fox News last night cut number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats their test\nAll of them all up all of them\nPolitically in any of the only thing that are open seemingly ... even though there is no senator\nCornyn Joni Ernst agreed with that do you agree with that\nI I agree uh because I think I'm In these red states that President Trump carried a I think that uh I think the judicial I mean I'm Sorry I'm so I think the Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are are confirming what Lindsey just set\nA ... as the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to\nA duck Cory Gardner who's the chairman this year as a as ... as basically confirmed\nThat you know I think things very big it's going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the visceral rejection of McCarthyism directed at\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because if they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw his hat demand judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry or what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and this this ridiculous\nAllegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or hug not display the appropriate temperament on the bench this man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nOr there were a couple of times where I think well one time and in particular where he asked judge or send her corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut he shouldn't be expected just to take a business slander these allegations of\nCriminal conduct and ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position who feels like they've been falsely accused I think would be angry and uh be justified in showing some of that anger\nLast question senator I I Know that some people might be a ... some good shape because of the FBI report not to vote for\nUm judge Kaplan I I think it will be a huge mistake unless they're direct corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican doesn't support him his or her career done as a Republican I've never seen the base of his way is that the general sense in the cockpit\nI think you'll see overwhelming support in the caucus for uh for the judge\nIn the middle of this political debacle another letter blurred at there was from the president of the American bar association Robert Carlson says my sale it'll colleague Larry Elder remember that letter that the president\nOf the ab a sense urging the Senate Judiciary committee to hold off voting on\nAnd now they're sets up very nicely for negotiating you know the big big deal is going to come to hopefully with China because they they are the worst or you know abusers of betrayed laws and on the planet one other quick thing Larry I was there at the rose garden when Donald Trump had his past outbreaks of one of the points you made\nIs he said look I Want to use these tariffs has a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce tariffs on us\nAnd I have to say you may not agree with a tactic but boy is it working because these countries are reducing their cherished\nEven a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries and the University of Chicago survey of top economists found Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off with NAFTA\nThan the previous trade deals so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI did you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped draft now they're back in Nineteen Ninety two or three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nBut Trump also had a point that it could be approved this with the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement it's now called the U. S. M. C. A. we're not going to call nap any longer but it is a new on North American trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries\nIs modernized and give us Americans a better deal and uh so I I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing a minimum wage out in other countries should right and that's one of the things I don't like about this deal so there you got me on that one that's not you know we we won Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics and this plan show I'm going to agree with you on that\nOne so on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for the candidate has imposed against us and Louis ... and ... and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nNot just in just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of you know as you know we've talked about this on your show before war and more what Americans producers called intellectual property we produce\nComputer software we Patton sent copyrights and and acknowledge each and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and some and certainly trying on and many other countries and Asian countries they just steal or intellectual property and this new ah alcohol at the U.S a CNA has much better protections\nFor not America's intellectual property so countries are going to use a product they actually pay for them\nWas under the entire interview with economist Stephen Moore on Tylenol review dot com is coming up\nOn an alien hours of taxpayer money went to prepare religions America's religion for the discovery of extra terrestrial\nLife sounding the alarm on bureaucratic waste when the total review returned home it\nGood news you are not stuck with your health care plan\nReally you have a choice that it's a great when it's called met a share and if you've heard about it and wondered what exactly it is it's a way that people share their health care bills and these are people who have a common face you want to be part of something beautiful that not only meat for their health care needs but the needs of others too\nAnd it's people who love to save money big time met her she remembers typically save\nFive hundred dollars a month per family on their health care costs that has a life changing for people so this could be for you maybe it's what you've been looking for a way to pay health care bills it's not only very smart financially but it's even profound met a series of non profit with four hundred thousand members nationwide pray for and share with each other\nSo he is or not stuck there is another way and it could save you a lot find\nOut more call a three three thirty nine Bible has a three three thirty nine Bible a three three thirty nine five\nIs your dog ditch scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die by pro order and Ninety Days supply of dynamite\nEverything we tried failed except the dying of I\nPick up two bottles of super mega fish oil get the third bottle free packed with omega three ... and ... fatty acids super ... great for your dogs immune system healthy skin and soft shiny bird dogs love it try super omega fish oil by to get one free and dynamite dot com\nI N o v I take a\nBreak I Am happy in Miami and rode a horse drawn\nAround\nSettlers thinking of doing\nThat true bin ... best parts coming\nUp through a dedicated to home in Atlanta are essay\nWhich part of this is true though the wagon horse drawn nationwide backwoods trailer side Dr was a two lane dirt road dirt okay not dirt but two lanes why the yeah because we need one ... have\nNot sexy nerd we've built our seniors delivering smiling service no surprise up from ... tax you can trust queen screen trained and timely everyone over there you go a good story one ran happy would be prone started that again ...

bring your Bible to school and read it and nobody can take it away that's\nOne of the great things about living in America but oftentimes a school administrator or a teacher will come up and say hey you can't do that it's illegal right have a one sheet from alliance defending freedom\nAnd people can print that at the website they give it to the teacher and I go oh okay it looks like it's a way to go ahead\nAnd that's typically have the day goes on in your face thing these now uh are usually pulling together a little table talk Bible study at lunch at school they're reading the book uh John or something it's self directed the F so they do whatever they want to do but\nAt the website bring your Bible dot org we have ideas for youth pastors and test the teachers and parents on what to do\nThat one more sketchy than the first then a third but the woman involved in that accusation changed her story Democrats committed to removing Kavanaugh then dug out the report of a bar fight from the Nineteen eighties in which Kavanaugh allegedly wait for it through ice yeah\nJust sorted out Salem host Arab ma taxes spoke with John's ... senior editor of the stream\nOkay John what do you have to say\nWell what we saw was the the equivalent of a show trial\nWhere the people in charge of the show trial trying to destroy someone's good name just saw him politically and destroy us politically or they just kept rewriting the rules and moving the goalposts\nAnd to mix metaphors throwing ... one piece of spaghetti at the wall after another\nAnd see if it sticks and then if it doesn't stick it doesn't matter 'cause there's more spaghetti and the thought oh my God and Audi found some\nYou know a distorted woman who's been you know who's been subject to penalties for harassment and defamation of character\nAll right well that's that's why I got something else or yet what do you think about this it's like a traveling salesman comes to your door and he's pulling these weird gadgets out of a velvet bag I you know oh you don't you don't want a watermelon sharpen your okay that's absolutely fine I got something here that you could make toothpaste outta him you don't want\nThat okay let me try something out [laughter] it's like Mr Hany from green acres [laughter] yes and Mr Douglas I have a genuine raccoons coat I've always wanted to do my Mr any impression on the air so anyway the the thing is ... let me just say this um [noise] we are\nUnfortunately\nAt war we yeah we were playing Patty cake we're playing nice and I really think that if Kavanaugh had been\nAble to be voted on before the flight flake out\nUh I think\nWe could have proceeded and the the the bitter left would have continued to snap and growls but we could have moved on with some semblance of order with this having happen now with this call for this FBI investigation I think the gloves are now off on both sides I think that\nYou know they tell you what it's about it's not it's not just about Kevin ... it's not just about the Supreme Court it's not even just about roe versus Wade which without even know how to vote this isn't about destroying Trump's presidents I was on the phone this morning with some very serious people who who used to work in the ministry and this is about\nStopping Kavanaugh preventing Trump from from getting a nominee on the court getting the base of the Republican base so just spirited so defeated so humiliated that we don't just lose the house of representatives\nAnd Trump gets impeach which is like an indictment the Democrats now think they can win the Senate and remove him from office that is how revved up\nThis pack of sharks are because they taste blood in the water\nSo really that's what this is about this is all about taking down President Trump it's I mean each Brett Kavanaugh is a nice guy who was friends with the Bush family he's the kind of establishment Republican I Would probably normally avoid like the plague\nBut I'm sure they are very good jurists\nNone of that matters nothing about his character matters now people are saying he's guilty of perjury we can't prove that he molested Dr Ford with can't prove he ever met her it doesn't matter doesn't matter the inconsistencies in her story which she toll under oath none of that matters what matters is maybe\nWe can catch him in in an exaggeration or a slight\nInadvertent misstatement of facts concerning his college drinking habits\nNow I just want to be clear people are saying he committed perjury because he didn't night that he drank ... no he didn't he spent he said quite specifically\nI never drank so much that I blacked out or had time or I didn't remember what I had done that is all he said under oath\nAnything else you hear people talking about I wouldn't call it spin I Would call it a lie I Would call it leibel and character assassination and anyone who says otherwise he lied about drinking no he didn't eat your lying perjury what is your character problem\nWe have to I mean the fact we have to have this silly conversation but just to show people understand uh we're talking about something that happened a million years ago for for for starters then we're talking about the whole thing is sort of degrading\nThen I'd I'd like to point point people to an article I wrote last week\nHas gotten some some place the title it's at at the stream Christian blaze blazing toward abortion process here I just want to point out this woman did work for six years for a company called course apps that makes the abortion pill\nI Want to hear the question John I can I ask the question how do you account for the fact that this woman who is their number one a witness this is everything hinges on her we find out\nAmazingly that she was on this gigantic multi multi billion dollar company that produces the abortion pill\nThey're always talking about this but they're but they're only talking about this and I let her know second go ahead ... ... yeah\nThey don't want this to be about ... the way the White House is saying no no\nDon't make this about abortion because we need Susan Collins of all we need Murkowski out don't make this about abortion so the ward has got out from the White House don't make this about abortion but I'm a journalist I worked for the White House and I have to point out that\nChristine for and work for six years for a company course of technologies that makes one product the abortion pill now it's also used\nFor Cushing is disease okay and that's how they got an FDA approved what's pretty innocuous usage and then what they do what they use it off label you know the way people use opioids off label right uh\nOnly most of its revenue there that it makes like two hundred and sixty million dollars a year they're not enough Christians patients on the face of the earth to provide that kind of revenue so it makes it funny term abortion\nWhen I Want to know what is it is he has\nHad stock in it what does she have stock from what she worked there which ... which have Lewis financially if we're all the way to overturn a senator should have asked hurt that\nDr Frank ... phone is the national director of priests for life and he examined the attacks on Kavanaugh he noticed an underlying motivations which mere act touched on a moment ago he explained the bigger picture with Don crow on weight in Washington D. C.\nWould you agree with the heart of all this really is the issue of the pro life movement terrifying uh those on the left the pro abortion is that in fact if judge Kavanaugh joins the court things may shift in the next few years regarding abortion in this country\n[noise] yes that's exactly right and the Democrats are admitting that law whatever the results of this at the gates you might be whatever uh uh proof we can or cannot present a war and the alleged behaviors\nAs actors they consider him dangerous pick for the Supreme Court and its ideological which is the ideological position that they most\nFear is the one regarding abortion\nOr many commentators have pointed this out to those of us who are in the ... the leadership of the pro life movement I mean the cast of characters who are on the Democratic side of the Senate Judiciary committee are among the leaders in the pro abortion effort in our country you know these people\nAnd Kamala Harris for example you know came over from California and and uh was busy over they're prosecuting toys activists and I I mean we see it as clear as day and even before Brett Kavanaugh's name was announced by President Trump\nRoe versus Wade was the subject of the hysteria of the left ever since Anthony Kennedy the step down\nNo excuse me course behind this throughout all the battle over in life and the ... and the the lines that have been drawn on the culture of planned\nParenthood has been of course the biggest boar abortion provider in the country although\nThose who support them and they themselves are you will look only three percent of what we spend actually goes for abortion speak to that the erroneous thinking the above dishonest thinking and reporting as a matter of fact and really a or how they also have a big stake in this\n[noise] yes I Am a very big steak or you know first of all that three percent or a number even if your ticket at face value which ah it it is not valid but even if you take it that way I mean what business do you engage with the sale why we all have killed three percent of our customers\nI mean we're talking about the taking of human life all joke about abortion\nBut the way that they count their services they combine them\nSo that if a woman going forward abortion has a you know two or three different um services that are given to her as part of that very procedure their ... separately so are the three percent doesn't represent the fact that a Planned Parenthood you know while they are decreasing as their own their annual reports show\nDecreasing the amount of other kinds of services it's all in the area of abortion but they continue increasing and in the course of the year we're talking about over three hundred thousand abortions being committed it's incredible number a but but it they are in big danger because uh\nHe shared young men please remember talking about cabinet Kavanaugh was yes he got angry all the also crime young men please remember crying as something real men do when they are passionate about their causes it's a sign of strength integrity and honor\nAnd I read tweeted that on my wall\nSo a woman chimed in earlier is insulting Democrats not answering their questions what a real man\nDoes too [noise] and I'm like here we go right don't fall ploy into the abyss Samantha coal bantering and bickering that is politically based\nThat's just what the enemy would love us to do [noise] so I just responded here's a word for you context\nThis man has been vilified has had his character assassinated by the left to viciously\nSo I said yes that is what a God fearing man does she rulers just like Jesus formed a whip\nAnd so short time later another man jumped in and then I thought okay I'm Out I'm not going to do this back and forth thing\nBut he had shared he's fallible he's made mistakes in his life like we all had but all I saw was a very angry man who was not humble wasn't not contrite felt like he deserved to be on the Supreme Court that is not a man I see Jesus supporting\nAnd I just said humble question mark contrite question mark brother if my character was assassinated viciously in my family was threatened you better get out of the way\nYou better believe he was angry I say amen to his anger\nHis anger his his emotion his crying stating his case clearly\nMen okay to be righteously angry there are women that no part of that anger is also protecting them from wrongdoing\nBut there is a very cynical devious spirit that is rearing its ugly head it's that\nDark spirit of rebellion I talk about [noise]\nIt's evil fully manifest in the realm of spiritual warfare right here\nRight now coming up [noise] but if I'm saying what the word says [noise] God by his Holy Spirit still take that very voice of Jesus to the hearts that the people\nI look at how good dancers preach when the Christian outlook returns in a moment [noise]\nYou know than [noise] than [noise] than Iraq with the\n[laughter]\nOn your
