because the presidential polling ... is showing that a wall all this stuff has been going on a President Trump's poll numbers have gone up because we each end\nOf last week the rescue mission poll had him at fifty one percent and I see yesterday's somebody had him at forty one percent which was high for them\nSo why his numbers have been going up or as a result of all this\nCan't they can't help but go up because what you're seeing is that President that's actually doing a very good job\nAnd you're seeing the opposition that is just freaked out I'm no worthy issue um ... ... you know mental mangled opposition and he like I said he's doing a good job he's steady nice to have you noticed these attacking or less\nA it with the exception of at the rallies and he does such a good job of that um he's doing a superb job or a communicator his ideas\nAnd um you can't help but go up I mean look at the economy a look at our international relationships that are actually improved over what we had over the past eight years mhm\nA look what's happening in places like North Korea and even though China is trying to collect little muscle if it weren't for the fact that our president was acting like a man and the ... and and being a leader\nYou wouldn't even have that China would be sneaking around unopposed doing everything they want to do and now they're facing a real man in the White House and

damage because this is going to be a hundred and twenty miles plus winds coming ashore and um there's not too much you can be done about there's nothing to slow down or stop at a eighty four eighty five degree weather but at least where we're at\nRight here in Tampa we're very fortunate right now that the storm is far enough away from us that we're going to get maybe some rain maybe a little bit
