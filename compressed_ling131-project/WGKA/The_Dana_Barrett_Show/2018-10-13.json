years wrote a book about it is difficult relationship with his fog and how he urine to have his own father and his house I'm Talking about ...\nAnd it's been fascinating watching all these people

network for blacks is MSNBC and I've read that MSNBC ...\nAbout thirty percent of the ratings come from black viewers you just the top\nCable channel watched by black in America and that is why you have people like Chris Matthews constantly constantly putting out the race card only to admit when his guard is down\nThey didn't believe it how do I know that here is what he said day before yesterday listen very carefully\nBut I Do understand President Trump is as much as any of us do Haley should he do that than it does the thing and they get in the contest of ideas and politics that

invited to the oval office or politics\nThat fine I think it's also it's it's runs against the ideas and he's a racist\nIt runs against the either in terms of like mine are they is that he's going after her Ronan going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects your comes it will and politics and it's sort of a racial way and Harriet flipping it confuses people but mainly it's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most them if they think they're racist\nDid you hear that\nMostly he invited Kanye West in the oval office for white people because white people most of them won't vote for somebody if they think he's a racist says Chris Matthews if that's what you believe and why is that you are constantly saying things like this\nWhen he said today America First was not just the racial I mean they are but I should say racial the Hitler areas of backgrounds of course nothing about human rights something about gender writes other things it here from a

get in the contest of ideas and politics than the other people don't do area sitting with a hip hop guy who apparently is it's got some sort of bizarre politics that Doug Fine I think it's also it's it's runs against the ideas and he's a racist\nIt runs against the Trump like mine are they is that he's going after her Rona going after a Maxine Waters going after the usual suspects if you will and politics\nAnd it sort of a racial way and Harry is limited and confusing people but mainly it's for white people because white people won't vote for a guy most them if they think they're racist\nHe

it's a comedy and you can like you said that that that it's tackling dating in the digital era um and it's going to deal with relationships both romantic and familiar because you'll see my mom is played by both on our cat who's also dating um she's in her fifties and widowed\nI'm living with my character and just starting her life over for the first time and killing on a dating apps and then you have my younger sister Jane who's in her twenties she's the millennial\nWho who kind of living by society's rules you know she got married before thirty has a kid but now it's sort of feeling like that seven year itch and her marriage and getting a little bit bored wondering if she made the right decisions in his living vicariously through our characters as we're having fun\nTo Jules about your character Livio what kind of person who should\nShe uptight and the beginning she works in insurance is doing really well\nI'm without a relationship for the last few years she had a five year one that you know after she got out she just went dove into her work and didn't date and had done really well and so now she's just starting her sister talks are into getting on tinder after she goes to the gynecologist in ... who's played by Jason to Vegas where he tells her that\nAt thirty five basically you're starting to dry up and if you ever want to have kids or anything you better you know like you you kinda gotta get started on that we've been dating um which is a lot of things I think that women here in their thirties and there was such a thorough there on tender and um she decides to date olive matches and you'll see her kind of start opening up throughout the season\nAnd becoming a different person away all of them have big ark\nWe'll she has two hundred and fifty to mess so yeah you do is doing the ultimate in speed dating or yeah or you assume that not every day there's a home run is now\nYes and also she's not always the home run you know what I mean like I feel like that's a big part of dating is\nI was the ... you know the like drink too much or I was the one that was ruining the date sometimes get right in the first episode you'll see that she's the one that's the the ...\nUm and it's not a date of the week shows the it's not like you'll see a different date every week and then you know we're going to go on to enter the episodes it's really not that it's just the jumping off point of the show but the show is really a grounded it's about life more than it is about just tender dating and these relationships between the mom and sister\nUm that I think a lot of people will find relate a ball and a lot of it's based on my own experiences in life whether it be with dating or just embarrassing things like the gynecologist office that seen happen to me\nI'm so you'll see a lot of that stuff about to life where it's kind of cringe worthy comedy sometimes [laughter] but I Love to watch\nSo when do you think that many matches with Olivia learned about human beings and what does she perhaps alert them so\nYeah I mean that's that's really the message is is\nYou know she's not at the end of the day she's not out looking for Mr Right to save the day and come in and you know live happily ever after I'd like to get the message across that you know you're going to even experience all these things in life but really the most important thing is she's figuring out who she is\nAnd what she loves that if somebody gets into that part you know naturally than great but it's these three women kind of figuring out who they are at the later stages in life\nUm and and how important that is and how much it affects you if you bring somebody in and get married and make that everything to you what happened like right on I Want her husband died she left with nothing you know she has no skills he's never had a job and she has to come up with my character and I and so a big part of it is just you\nKnow as women I think we're we're taught as kids like the print Saturday live happily ever after and you find your print and all that stuff and it's just it's so much more about know figure out who you are you know do your thing they got what makes you happy and if somebody fits into that great\nYou know you mentioned the ... mom Mary she's old dating yeah\nPlay by rather than our cat is amazing\nThe fact of the ... or something in common is that India does that enhanced the relationship that they become closer his mother and daughter\nIn certain ways that die than in a certain way that it it you know a makes it worse because of your mom is dating and she's living with her and her she's a little bit like a teenager you know what I mean she's like I said she'd never had a job as you're going to see her\nGet a job for a first time like figure out what it's like to be independent and Olivia their role to reverse where Olivia is more like the mom and she's like the kid so and how that affects Olivia when she really just\nNeeds a mom you know it it it sort of based on like when my mom was single in her fifties they're very different my mom's very independent but the idea that um\nThat that when you're when she's doing that and I kind of become your friend as opposed to your mom and how that affects the relationship I always found that really interesting and I bring that into their relationship\nYou mentioned the rows and rows of course is your ... was it like working with her\nIt was really fun I mean she's a proud she's been doing this forever and she's so good\nAnd honestly was perfect for the role like as soon as her name was brought up everybody we were just trying to think who who would be good for this role you know some it's in their fifties and bodies all of these\nCharacteristics are going to be at least play them and she was she was dead on and when we met her\nShe just was game to do anything so that was awesome and and had her own ideas I wanted to bring menopause into this world you know what I mean like what it's like to be going to ... I found that really funny and interesting and sad\nI'm so she was great I mean the fact that he was gay to do everything it's a very vulnerable role that I think a lot of actresses would have trouble playing that she\nTook on and did have challenges but but handled them really well and I think now that in the end\nRight now you mentioned that size what is the least partially autobiographical so humble shovel Livio is truly you\n[noise] you know it's it's it's based on\nParts of me you know but it's not it's not like it's definitely not an autobiography it's not I'm not just like\nPlaying myself exactly there's a lot of things about her that maybe are things that I went through before that she still having to go through or they're loosely based on even like other people that I Know that I'll bring into the character but I always at the core of it almost every character I write has a piece of me and I'm\nI'm so so there's that but it's definitely not an autobiography um I don't I you know I'm not\nAs uptight as her and closed minded as she is you know but there are there are big pieces of of me that are in there for sure\nSo personally when it comes online dating your view was through some of the positives and we'll just some of the negative\n[noise] well I think it's you know there's a lot there's a lot of choice and I think it makes it more people\nWill you know like if it makes it hard for people to settle down like they do like somebody and then they'll be like but what else is out there because there is something else out there you know there's a little you can go home and and go to bed and get your phone out and start swiping on more people and have two more days the next day if you want\nSo I think that that can be a little bit of a negative ad help it it makes it where people it's hard to connect I mean that that that in the show it's easy to match hard to connect that in that the big problem\nBut positives are I went on there\nAnd had all those two hundred and fifty two matches in real life and I met my boyfriend who I've been with for over two years so I think you know if you can just kind of sift through and when you find somebody that's worth it and great stop and take it in and connect it can be really amazing because I wouldn't imagine otherwise\nRight and you know we think the way that you know the full front and center of a mountain a civilized nation but today [laughter] you can't judge people by our standards either\nI think you know you have to take place people in that time to understand why they ... they they don't want they said what did what they did but still like I said everybody had to eat everybody had a family everybody was worried about you know staying alive\nIt's the same major can sense we've always had as humans\nAnd Andrew working people find out more about secrets on line\n[noise] um well really Smithsonian Channel have a website or you can also go to our website but she's being filmed um and I just want to share the more the ... the previous areas as well because the there'll be a number of theories out for this but that\nUm you know they're bringing shows on that just that great fun and I
