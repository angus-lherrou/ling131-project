in some cases the hangers that were there were gone\nOf the living quarters ever there were destroyed roofs torn off windows busted\nUm they were using the runway which had been able to clear off for the bigger planes that were coming in which supplies and heavy equipment because they've got heavy equipment from the Army Corps of engineers coming from different engineering battalions around the country big equipment which is what they're gonna have to use to move\nThe debris not only at that base but also\nIn Mexico beach and Panama City and elsewhere in the panhandle because the devastation doesn't stop along the water it goes all the way to the Georgia State line\nAll those little small communities on up there in the south Georgia\nLottery destruction lotta devastation because those homes are up and there were much older homes and you know what happened with a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds and again this cat three but a hundred and twenty five mile an hour winds the mobile homes to pre man you're the manufacturing homes all that that are not built for that a\nLot of them were flat and a lot of them were destroyed and they still don't know the scope\nOf the people that are reported missing because there's no phones there's no cell phones there's no landlines\nThere's no electricity no water\nThere is no gas lines gas lines have been disrupted in some cases rip right out of the ground gas tanks which make it very dangerous and the possibility of fire one was just about anywhere you're turning 'cause you can you can smell natural gas in the air went up there where I was at\nAnd there was absolutely no smoking in any kind for that reason and of course the fire department asking back in there and seal off the gas lines the gas company doesn't have enough people to do it so I slept pretty much to the fire department to do which they can do ... part of the training that we have\nBut it's dangerous very dangerous all cases a spark and I want to tell you some\nThe death toll is you only go higher you know why I Know them\nBecause in removing the debris to allow the big clippings or go down some of these roads were blocked by rubble housing rebel\n[noise] they were warning the operator should be very very careful and they weren't just taking that debris and just taking a somewhere dumping it they were going to sift through the debris to see if they can find the remains of people that they thought might have died perished in the structures\nAnd we will not say [noise]\nMorning America hello\nAnd welcome to the average American third

we're looking just just for for all we emphasize the George under God because our great country was founded on your Judeo Christian values well first of all I Want to mention um\nOver the weekend or I went up with a group of communication so experts to um [noise]\nUh the affected areas we were in Mexico beach we were in a ... of Panama City I'm a ... but on the city and we were in general Airforce base and the devastation Frank was up there\nWas worse than anything I saw on Charlie ... odd because there are a whole areas where there's nothing nothing\nYeah it it got flattened ... feel we were we were we were talking about how how devastated here category for ... or or do you got a category if I can be and not screw around when they talk about reading and this is a perfect example why you don't screw around when they ask you about\nWell I got an email from a person and uh it's kind of a you know I'm I'm a ... normally wouldn't do this but I don't think we would mind but I got an email from a person and uh let me see here I'm going to read this trio\nAnd said good morning kept to map\nThe day of the storm my paper company was early\nSo that we could get it done before the storm hit\nAnd I was listening to a talk show host it I never really listen to before your show came on and I'm not going to say his name but he was talking about how it wasn't going to be that bad of a storm he said the weather channel was lying\nThere were hyping it up and I was thinking to myself that he was going to get somebody hurt or killed I turned on the radio started to listen to you and I can't tell you how much we thank you myself and my family there's no telling how many lives you said by your accurate reporting on hurricane Michael we thank you up here in South Georgia and he was\nRight there where the ... came across the line into Georgia\nThere you know ... the people who said don't worry about it when we started a new overly I think if they\nThey do anything in these he'd say under I\nTell you know there there there's no reason to the same butter safe than sorry and I get the ... that people are seeing the pictures though oh oh what a huge looks like a beep when you see a situation like that when you have boots on the ground first hand\nYou don't really understand how bad the the\nWell they had piles of debris across the highway where you had to go around because they were trying to be very careful about removing that debris because there might be remains human remains in there and they were being very very careful\nThat's number one and the death toll will go higher I can tell you that there are still missing about two hundred and fifty people in Mexico beach and they believe they stayed behind and\nYou know there's no communication is no phones no cell towers of of all the cells gone that land lines are gone powers John Waters gun a natural gas lines of the fire department was doing a lot of uh tying off natural gas lines that were there a propane tanks and all that sort of stuff because the smell of natural gas was in the air\nOh sure yeah I went through a withdrew Andrew back back in there every night and ... when you get a chance to see something that that is that master and and that devastating it humbles you a media\nYour power that that comes when nature has a theory\nYep now I Want to talk about um some politics obviously but I wanted to get that out there and again thank you very much because there are there are people that are listening to us up there in that zone right now that area and uh you know help is on the way you you know that and you'll start to see the cell towers and\nYou'll be getting some of what you got back again but to get the power back it's going to take a little while so you know oh yeah yeah well\nYeah we we we had power trucks lined up all the way past Pensacola pre storm wait waiting to respond to wherever wherever the devastation was going to be with that takes time and those guys are going to be working a lot of overtime hours with very little sleep that's what they end up doing so\nI Know when when people want to start get aggravated because taking so long you guys are working hard so sort of give a little trick\nNow there's been all kinds of polling done lately and ABC News Washington Post poll indicates that Democrats are still favored to win back the house of representatives which I totally doubt and the survey also showed a five percent approval rate for a president Donald Trump which is a\nPretty good they're showing that Donald Trump is on the increase
