in the panhandle taking care of Florida tonight and south Georgia to don't forget to check out the captain's America's third watch dot com website\nThat's the captain's America third watch dot com website well Denise Simon from disco dot com is here with is good morning\nI'm all in time to talk about what the heck is going on in Saudi Arabia because there was one headline that says President Trump says the U.S may skip the Saudi form is new details now emerged on the murder of the journalist\n[noise] well I I think we're getting reward and murder may be a little\nBetter than over step [noise] um I mean from\nHow it reported that the logical conclusion that it was a murder but here's the deal could show me\nUm had gone to the\nConsulate in order to get a document that says if he had been divorced in order to marry his fiance who was sitting in the car um he kind of knew something was up and that's why he left her his cell phone with her\nOr what the instructions or something happened you know call somebody call the president or turkey or something um\n[noise] and that's how this thing came down so fast\nNow I think what the Saudis were gearing is what is known as rendition they said that a lot of rain in panic things I'm at the at the height of\nThe Afghan in Iraq or if it were in rendition or where we take some people off the battlefield and we've put them in some kind of an intention and then we ... them to some other location for\nUm a longer term detention and interrogation\nRepairs and what are the Saudis or doing or they were going to render\n... back to Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia he\nActually got thrown out of Saudi Arabia\nOr because of his dissent and because of the things that he had been calling for quite some time and um\nAnd he was in self exile here in the United states meaning he was not a U.S citizen he was a green card holder living in Virginia and working for the Washington Post\nNow uh what is the ... thing is going back\nTo being Nineteen\nSeventy it's important to understand that a ... he was an active member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd boom bang bang Muslim Brotherhood has zero use 'em for the ... hobby a sec or the hobby Islam in Saudi Arabia\nUm he was also part of what is known is Islamic society of North America which is the U.S wing of the Muslim Brotherhood it was also I'm\nOne of the co conspirators earning died in ... of the holy land foundation trial so the the the United states knows more about um give them all to show me then um what they're necessarily letting on that fine I don't have a problem with that\n[noise] um now uh it it can get a little hairy here because uh they're concocting some kind of a\nStory on necessarily what happened and they say he died in in in in in ... I Believe that he was probably drug in order to um have him travel and get him out of the country\nYeah they were going to change them back to Saudi Arabia right\nLet's call rendition\nAnd I believe that he was probably given some kind of drugs or some kind of narcotics um during the interrogation and they'd probably over did it so um he died or some kind of a drug overdose in in the latter of\nAh going through the interrogation for rendition now the big question is what they do with the body well we're hearing things like bombs saw an extra two cases that were bought and so forth and so on so\nUm that's where we necessarily are now gets a little bit interesting because\nHe is that Matthew I'm ...\nAnd you may not remember at non ... but he was one time one of the largest track a career as a weapon dealers in the night I mean in the war all going back several years that happened to be hit yeah\nThen it gets even a little bit hairy here because [laughter] um I think back and trying to remember back in early\nYeah late eighties maybe a Donald Trump bought a yacht\nA lie think it was an honor roll forget how much money it was good it was it it was an extensive yacht happened to be owned by the uncle at non Shelby [laughter]\nThat must be the one I heard about the words do their job or\nPoorly all heard about the only the only got that he ever had right oh ... uh the previous\nOwner was at a Christian so the point at all that is there some other back\nUm that are going to I think that are causing this ... between the kingdom reuniting stay in Turkey on the matter what happened to your market show the\nDrink will ever know the truth you know\nAnd by the way they did say the rumors that we're hearing and I don't know where those rooms are coming from where is that they were going to take two of the intelligence officers who botched the interrogation and send them back to Saudi Arabia to Detroit\nWe're all going back there were ... they were twelve guys that apparently\nFlew in to handle this and render him back to Saudi Arabia\nIs well hold that thought to hit the hold that thought [noise] I ... as Denise Simon someone who's going to not come we'll be right back with me and\nUm we will talk about a finish up our conversation there was talk about the GPS joins three testifying today we'll find\nMore by everybody this is the ... members to

got a missing journalist\nWho we believe was killed a we believe that there's evidence of that because that's what we've been told\nBy the Turkish who say that there's audio and perhaps even something else involved but they're not producing whatever it is they have and in the meantime I'm the Saudis came out and said that\nTwo of their intelligence people\nAnd by the way the or hit squad that was over there or whatever they want to call it the assassination team whatever it was I went in there the security guys over twelve um that went there to bring this guy back to Saudi Arabia 'cause you just wanted our chargers there\nAnd uh they uh they uh apparently have\nGot some short of audio or whatnot of what took place but the uh the crown prince said that uh uh no no no no no there was a governor interrogation that went bad and um ... that's how he he died he got killed but we still don't know what happened to the body doing\nNot yet we're still looking around for that man I I'm you know what the audience that you're ... that's about all of course of the country I mean because you know we did was a guy question [noise] and we just let us know what he said\nWell I Know why that's why he said and that's all he said because listen to the pieces of the puzzle here is Saudi Arabia in the middle of a big military deal with the United states a big purchase\nThey're supposed to be yeah\nHow about a hundred and ten billion dollars were number one surprise is with us which the president said he does not want to have that go by the wayside you don't really wants to have to be

say I don't like it\nAt home game that's how the game is played and ... you know decent and nice and I talked about this last hour but I wanted to definitely talk about it we do and it's very obvious from where we said um the the tangled Web that we weave in how this is a\nThis is making itself through there and now the president did say the U.S might skip the Saudi forum\nA as the details are

now today as we speak\nOut on bail\nThat's correct so he's on their smoothing out the edges finding out what's going on letting them know detained them that is that there's nothing to worry about\nWhere we're still going to help them where they're up or what they want to get in terms of their military because uh you know we may have to use them they may have to end by the way or the other ones who gave Israel permission to fly over their airspace and they do and they had been working with Israel they recognize Israel so that's all a good thing\nYeah yeah so that's something we
