Simon founders code that Tom good\nMorning along and now we were talking about South Korea and North Korea and the U.S and the summit possibly coming at the earliest days and then I got a question from Peter in Westley chapel he's saying captain of\nThe reports are that there is a looming war coming soon Israel versus from us any truth to that\nUm well like butter or um\nAnd a more serious questions for ... an won't be in the normal conventional sense\nUm we ... a month to have fired yet and all the other kinds of things so that would\nGo back to the type of conflict that they had um [noise]\nGosh I think Korea her nine missiles or day that's where we still remember\nWhen John Kerry was you know he was all kind of involved in that ... and um Israel was you\nKnow doing the knocking on the worst kind of thing and then calling all on the thing the innocent yeah it would be more that kind of\nThing that I'm you know some kind of a a ground war [noise]\nOkay um and do you think that they were being grown their troops underground as they have done once in a while\nNo no they don't do ... troops on the ground okay Israel does not do that [noise]\nOkay because at one time they had their tanks weren't roaring into some of those around them and border around [noise] okay\nAnd they would put them I mean they would do the best thing that they've got all the other defense is a technology that they put out there but um no they would go back to that same Kennan tactic they carry a silk secretary's day\nOkay now we have a situation going on in China where it looks like ... now we're hearing that the Interpol president is being held and the word is pro ... for illegal conduct what's that all about\nOne of the first thing that they will need to understand is that\nYou have to look at the wider operations of China for China to have a representative you will I think the name of the main him in the um him we had a Interpol which is\nA obviously the international criminal investigations and and human trafficking and those kind of thing\nUm that I Would say would be some kind of a cover up of what China does because they they kind of a make people go missing all the time that are detrimental to China\n[noise] and so I Believe that he was actually called back to China and saying uh you either one or not well you're not doing what we need you to do as head of their poll\nAnd so here he got called back he didn't talk communicate with anybody for like thirty days is why it's kind of\nLive in Paris she freaked out she notified the authorities they've put her under a security\nUh and then he sends a message that just had a knife in it that says he's in some kind of trouble well he's in trouble um because he's not doing I think all the things that China needs him to do a which I Would argue are quite nefarious\nSo if he expects to go back to his wife and China I don't think it's going to happen Mm [noise] so he has resigned as they had in our poll and I believe South Korea has a some kind of a minister the stepping in\nTo take his place since he has resigned\nSo are there are some really kinda nasty nefarious stuff going on there um ... I think in\nThe coming days we'll we'll get a little bit closer to what some of those things work but China's not talking and obviously he's not talking ... China or a lot of talk of mine yeah there there's\nThat one that won the that one worrisome\nMm now let's talk about um [noise] something else it's worrisome China apparently has been caught again trying to hack something from the u._s. should apparently it's not it's\nNot even so much hack look I'm\nChina going back into the you know well going back even to the Bush administration but especially during the Obama administration\nChina has this bad what I Would call a decentralized network of opera and they don't have to be Chinese people they can be Taiwanese although they don't like Taiwan but they would you know extort people in order to to play China's game but China has dispatched\nOf these people across the globe\nAnd what they're there to de centralized network so one person doesn't know the other one the understand what I'm saying ... ... um and they they go to\nAll of these a government contractor then government times they work they well he's overweight end and then they start stealing they start with the espionage and won't pay for this and we'll pay you for that if you cough up\nThese good ... good and it's really quite interesting the thing is that China um has been doing\nAnd I would say there are these government they're not terribly ... including our own\n[noise] because I mean they have done a you know they they have a heart and I'll I'll give you a for instance of the things that China has been after for years and years and years and that include\nUm turbo than engine to a ... built by General Electric\nUm you know whatever they can get off of the F. sixteen fighters you get to see what I'm saying you know um they want to know about a nuclear capable cruise missiles\nThey wanna know about war head um and so you know they they take all of these things from General Electric or bowling or Lockheed Martin or you know whoever else and they won't\nPay big money um to get some of the things he even back in two thousand and five\nOkay they hold that thought we'll be right back roads or finish a conversation about China and what it is they're trying to steal from us and why and then there's an interesting story coming out of the turkey
