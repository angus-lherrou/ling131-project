as opposed to a civil libertarian agenda\nBette Midler caused an uproar unhappy about the Brett Kavanaugh hearings feeling that Dr Christine Ford was not given enough time [noise] pleaded women are the N. word of the world [noise]\nI Do\nNot make this [noise] but first of course [noise] ... by [noise]\nSusan Collins [noise] to vote\nFor the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh [noise] the means and less than a meteor hits the earth tomorrow Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed as the next justice of the Supreme Court now [noise] I Want to say something\nTo those of you who have no problem saying all women should be believed all men should\nNot be believed for those of you who felt that it's perfectly OK to accuse somebody who's had up until now impeccable reputation\nOf sexual assault without any cooperating witnesses corroborating evidence\nThat's not to say and I never have said and I defy you to find when I have said that Dr Christine Blasey Ford has a liar I've never said that I Do think something happened to her it's not my job to determine what happened to her though it's my job to determine whether or not\nWe have we have fairness here and as Susan Collins pointed out this is not a jury trial so it's not a standard beyond a reasonable doubt but certainly it's got to be more likely than not which is what she said\n\nAnd given his reputation given the number of women that have voucher his reputation given that nobody's ever made a kind of allegation before given that he's now undergone seven background checks given that the four people Dr Ford say where they're all say they have no recollection of it\nThat does not meet the standard of more likely than not\nFor those of you who were yelling and screaming berating people migrating Senator Flake\nLook at me look at me look at me\nFor those of you who believe that just because I'm applying this more likely than not standard therefore I Believe that Dr Ford is lying that believe a sexual abuse harassment and assault or not serious problems in America and been listening\nFor those of you\nWho took up on this issue not really so much because you're concerned about the issue because you want to stick it to Trump because as I told you the primary reason that people are afraid about Kevin uh because they believe you overturn roe v Wade\nNot listen to me very carefully\nSomehow some way this country function until Nineteen Seventy three with every individual state determining its laws on abortion\nIn states like New York California in fact in states where Seventy percent of the population resides had an abortion pretty much on demand\nAnd there's no reason to believe that if and when roe v Wade were to be overturned and it matter goes back to the states\nThe landscape would shift in a sort of dramatic way right now in conservative states you will not be able to find an abortion doctor they'd been shamed out of business\nAnd in ... states if all the way we're overturn what makes you think the state legislatures would suddenly enact anti abortion laws given their unpopularity in those states so in the real world\nNot a whole lot with change now how and why Robie way became known as a quote right to an abortion case it's beyond me\n\nAnd if you look at the LA Times article not Fox\nThat Breitbart National Review came out a few years ago\nAbout the opening of the papers of justice black man he was we signer of the author of the decision and he thought I was going to be a very narrow decision he thought that the decision on whether or not women should have an abortion was a medical decision one that should be made by doctors\nAnd he almost issued a warning that the this is an art not be ... be construed any other way he was talked out of it\n\nAnd so for those of you who have turned this into a man gets woman thing just because everything that you dislike him Donald Trump\n\nEverything he does everything he says you're going to attack it because you think evoke or because you think he's a bake it because you think he's a racist because you think this because you think that\nI guess what his approval ratings are up he's now at fifty percent according to Rasmussen guess what the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans used to be ten points just about a week or two ago is now plus two in favor of Democrats\nIs what they attack against Brett Kavanaugh\nEffected some leftist have referred to him as a attempted rape is for a serial rapist\nExcluded a backlash and the backlash is going to motivate Republican even when Kavanaugh gets on because you've already signal that you intend if you take over the house\nTo open up a piece when investigations so I'm urging Republicans not to let their guard down just because\nKevin ... is likely to be confirmed\nFor those of you who feel very strongly the other way\nAnd feel that this is the referendum against women that it means that you don't believe women I mean she's not taking a rape and abortion what rape and sexual assault and things like that seriously you haven't been listening I Know you're just like this\nBut one of the reasons Donald Trump got elected because he promised to nominate judges that would follow the constitution does now his second one\nAnd God willing the creek don't rise and he gets re elected he may have one or two more so for all of you who are very very unhappy about this I Want to say this very sincerely [laughter]\n\n\n\nOr you know you\n[noise] cornered Ted Cruz restaurants have sat at a restaurant [noise]\nWith my wife they were ... and you feel\nLost [noise] I've got to buy some dirt on to get back in the game [noise]\nAnd as Carl is with speaking she woke almost half hour she started out very slowly and you didn't know where she was going to go kind of built up to it [noise]\nYou could see the screen and the bottom right the there were two women that were in the forefront and you could just tell they weren't happy the way the same with going\nAnd they put their hands over their head when she began to wrap up when you can tell she was going to vote to confirm Kevin on they just looked at distraught and as I'm watching them\nAnd I'm listening to comment I said did you hear anything she said\nWith with what she said unreasonable none of it made any sense to you don't you care about how she ... got to her position\nShe said she spent more time on this went over hundreds of cases a was a brief did she said I think once a week by some a group of legal experts so she can understand what this was all about\nAnd she very carefully went over Christine forced testimony and very simply simply said as I said before that uh that she believed her she believes something happens before we can assign what happened to her to Kevin Oh there's\nGotta be fairness and while this is not a criminal trial and therefore you don't apply to standard of beyond a reasonable doubt into a moral certainty certainly it's got to be at least more likely than not and she went over the evidence in Sochi name for people\nWho she claims were were there and the poor people have no recollection of it or say they weren't there and now now what do you do with that\nCan cause also said that the person who who took her to the party or or or brought her back a has never shown up she got home somehow she didn't fly she didn't say that about didn't fly I added that but um she got home somehow and whoever it is we got her home never came forward and told us who he or she was\nAnd so given the background of Kevin all the reputation of Kevin ... all the women that are supported him all the women he's worked with with no allegation\nAnd we're going to deny him the seat on the Supreme Court because a woman who cannot corroborate her claim of doesn't really know the year doesn't really know where does know how she got that isn't how she got back didn't tell anybody\nShe said that just doesn't fast past the fundamental fairness test and everything she said was reasonable she's a moderate but the women in the bottom right hand corner apparently weren't listening\nOr have turned it off or felt that uh somehow it didn't make any sense I mean did you hear what you had to say does not matter\nThat she wanted people to think it through I bet you wanted to be an FBI investigation that you have more confidence that Dr Ford allegation had been thoroughly bet if you weren't even listening [noise] we when we come back though I'm Larry Elder\nLarry Elder all through\n[noise]\nTwenty the answer\nFor

to my house when I was at a school board meeting forty miles away and they waited for my husband to come home and when he came home they put a bullet in his head\nSo that is the basic story Jim ... and of course as we know Pam was put on trial for being the mastermind of this murder plot prosecution says that she wanted out of the marriage and instead of divorce she convinced this young man and his friends\nTo go and kill her husband so\nWho do you believe it's one of those kinds of stories\nWill on your special you interview him all smart and you know doing in did you have an opinion about her ...\nNo I don't I mean as an investigative reporter I I just go in and say okay what's the reality here you know what kind of characters and like dealing with [laughter] you know these these fantastical notorious cases we all make up our minds about who's guilty and who isn't\nWell I go in open minded and I tell me tell me your side of the story pan\nBecause when you look back you realize\nHer side of the story didn't really get told at that trial\nI I I'll tell you one opinion I have I don't think she got a fair trial\nThere was amazingly massive amount to pre trial publicity the media was all over calling her an ice princess in a black widow and\nHaving Pam smart look alike contest as she guilty or not and vote on this painting the potential jury pool I don't think she got a fair trial from the judge didn't he didn't allow the defense to put on witnesses said they wanted and\nI'd anyway I don't think she got a fair trial but I'm open to it or do you do you think she's the type that was capable of convincing a young teenager it was capable of thinking a young teenager was it the right one to turn to to kill her husband\nShe says no absolutely not and you'll see in the interview I did with her at the maximum security prison at Bedford hills New York she's adamant about it I\nI ask are you know if they offer you a ... to get outta here it\nJust to meet you did and she said no I'm not going to admit to something I didn't do I wouldn't do it then and I won't do it now so the result is of course she could be in prison until she dies\nWhile you were talking with her was there anything in particular that she said to cause you to have some doubt about guilt\nWell I'll tell you what causes me pause on most\nAre the tapes that were recorded way back in Nineteen Ninety Ninety One um they police wired her young intern a woman named Cecilia peers who you will see on our special\nThey put a body wire on her and ... capturing conversations were Pam smart says some pretty incriminating things I mean very incriminating things and you'll hear those tapes on this special she says things like um\nShe urges as Celia to lie to the police\nCars Cecilia is real good friends with Billy and his cohorts\nUm she says if you tell the truth [laughter] you're going to go to jail I'm going to go to jail Billy and Pete and all the ... we're all going to go to jail if you tell the truth [laughter] whoa that's what gives me pause so I I grill her on that what what are you ... to ... and you're you're caught on tape same stuff\nThey're grainy hard to hear tapes but I hear you saying this\nAnd her story is that\nThe police wouldn't give her any information about the investigation on who killed my husband so she turned to Cecilia\nWho always seem to know what was going on with the cops she said I Pretend to know about the murder so Cecilia would tell me what she knew about the murder right well you you listen to Cecilia you listen to the tapes you listen to Pam and you make up your own mind on that\nDo either way obviously yeah so I\nTell you there was one a one witness at trial a great best friend actually who took the stand and said yeah Pam told her she was going to go ahead and call Cecilia and pretend to know about the murder so she could maybe maybe get some information well\nMay be telling that friend that was part of her manipulation or maybe it was just the truth\nSo she like when you were interviewing her ... who's your overall impression of smart\nWell I first interviewed her back in the nineties and she was angry at that time she was really angry because the Nicole Kidman movie had just come out\nIt's not as complicated as you would think and the reward I mean even if it took a week and a half [laughter] it's it's worth\nNothing these days takes that long I mean that's definitely one of the country to a lot of things that people do these days you actually have to take some time and attention to create\nSo now I Know I think that's why I think that was part of the appeal I think it was\nAll of a sudden I'd never had a hobby before and now I'm doing something that actually flowing by life down in a way if you can't rush it you have to be patient you have to relax and I think that\nMaking that change in my life kind of made me a a a happier person [laughter] I think now you're so frantic and you're on the second your phone and you're constantly feeling here you have to do more and the bread doesn't let you do that if they have to\nProve for six hours there is no rushing that or do you just kind of have to adapt and and that and take your time I think uh that was definitely a big part of the appeal [noise]\n... I've always wondered about this what is the science behind creating this hour in sourdough\nUm the longer the you the longer that you let it for men the more that it could become though you can actually increase the the ... of it and then it becomes like that classic sourdough bread but\nWhen I say sourdough bread that's really the process of using a naturally\nThat it's not necessarily will come out like that were to read it you may have had in San Francisco it's really just the organic way of using east which is the origin away the bread was made you know we didn't have dry\nIn in ... in the old days it was a ... hour to start or basically do you have this wild east and that was used to make your bread and then started to manipulate it if you will leave it let it go for longer periods of time you can increase the activity and that was going to give you this hour\nWow that's amazing now some people will specially made the attempt to bake something quite frequently their efforts fall flat\nWill just some of the keys to achieving a successful baking outcome\n[noise] um I think you just have to have to pay attention I mean I'm not really things like that that really need for fishing I probably would fell off though but I find bred to be a little more forgiving if a little closer in the baking world to cooking\nWhere if you can have a little bit of a you can be a little floppy ear they'll have a a good result but\nI think you're a knowing that you can't rush it I think I'm is is a huge factor anything I'd of\nHang in there you'll get a good product\nWill Tom
