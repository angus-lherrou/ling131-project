quick check in with our friends at the CDC Dr Gary brunette is branch chief of the travelers health branch under the division of global migration and quarantine with the CDC and he's joining us now from Atlanta\nWell Gary well with the title like that clearly you're exactly the person we want to talk to on the topic of travel and potential uh so how are you to\nVery well well I Hope I and ended up the thank you very much\nWe appreciate that's all right so last month there was at least one flight where some passengers complained of sore throats and other flu like symptoms and the CDC was asked to investigate so I'm going to start off with traveling in the flu\nSince October is the official start of the flu season one or some top tips you recommend for travel during this time of year [noise]\nWell that's a good subject to start with because you're really getting into the season now and I think it's really important that people up to date with a with a flu shot I think it's the most important thing that you can do to prevent um line of defense\nAnd so we would encourage anyone to to get a vaccination\nOkay Gary either question I picked up a friend from Newark airport in New Jersey just a few days ago was this week and while I was waiting for her I saw several travelers coming off a slight with those papers face masks and I'm curious I Know there was a potential measles warning issued actually at Newark a few weeks ago\nI traveled they're concerned about avoiding airborne germs do those papers face masks actually help\nWell it's actually the ... with an effective or not I think some people just feel Gloria\nUsing and write on although people are concerned about getting illnesses are catching a bug on it on an airplane it's a relatively harmless environment although it is possible it's not what we tell people if they are ill\nIt'd be traveling we we advise people not only for their own sake but Paul Pillar traveling to avoid travel if they all\nSay are now and they have to travel maybe they should be wearing face masks please\nPlease people I'm All right so yeah so I think a lot of confusion about the time it's almost like sometimes when it's really in the media then everyone thinks it's all over the place and now it's really not in the media but you know it's still around right so can you give us the latest update on the ... is it active anywhere\nOh so early on in the last year we had a lot of reports in the media thought 'cause what if it was introduced to the way to handle it\nBut we haven't been hearing as much about it recently but you make an important point because it is very much present it is still present in a lot of the nation that people traveled to the holiday and people need to be aware of the\nWhat\nThe average person it's not really a concern but as we know there are complications and and help through associated with pregnant women getting the disease\nCPA CSP CDS\nMe did I get them all I think that well three of them\nAnd we also have Peter Lynch in more than Peter how are you are doing great last time we had your was your your uh maiden voyage it well we are uh you're you're in a sale dancer you just say oh yeah we're out of the half of the harbor and the end of the rough waters so ah\nAnd take it from your beat her now you know you anyway\nSo ah did you guys know our ways every week tell you the market's going to be up next week and sometimes that doesn't come true but well you were wrong you out of three times it does come through\nThis week that's more than average Korean well it's it's pretty easy you know these protests reign of the stock market would your wife senior sixty six percent right\nNow why would never tell me I'm writing one percent of the man not even going to be one do you have to show you got a husband my husband and then that I get fifty one percent of that you're getting fifty one percent\nWhen we're talking about his percentage of it he knows everything and I'm usually wrong on I mean\nNeat meaning any kind of pop\nCulture any kind of question and I'm like no that's not how it was it as they were looking at and think he's right so he has a good chance\nHere for the record on the radio waves shown if they're ... they're saying that her husband mark is right a lot of the\nTime when we went back and then I'd have a nowadays yeah but if you get fifty one percent of the better than than say he's wrong he says okay\nLeader at your house or anything remotely like that and not even close yeah so that's kinda my concept to I don't I you know depending on my mood I'm In his ... years the way you guys out there if you ever want to win an argument with his wife there is one\nAn easy way to do it you know not what do you mean what what you always say well at least I married better than you\n[laughter] so there I mean how she's going to argue with that she'll think about it in a minute just the way it was I don't know I ... and that's it least married better than you remember that and you're going to win ... smarter than right right right yeah like\nIt's almost like a cut down thing that she doesn't have good taste you let her work that out [laughter] anywhere nice\nAll right so the market was down fifty bases points half a percent has very clearly anything I agree um we had\nHad a few interesting things going on\nUh utilities gained at one point five eight percent wire utilities up in a week when the market is down ...\n... you know your allergies right yeah usually you would think that um if if utilities lead market something weird going on usually market is down when utilities lead a and the fact that they're positive when everything else is negative\nOr we saw the thirty year treasury actually gained Fifteen point seven basis points or point one five seven percent or everything across the board gained\nA but we did have something that's been pretty rare lately we saw a steep learning curve meaning that the longer term maturity is on the treasury um\nYield curve meaning gained more yeah the thirty year the ten year more than the the short term the two years five years seven near some of the opposite of what we've been saying absolutely yeah so I've talked several times about this on the air recently\nUh December we saw a a difference between the ten year and a two year\nJust a February rather than we're in two thousand Eighteen we saw about Seventy eight bases point difference point seven eight percent about three quarters of a percent that ten year was higher than the two year a what we saw this week uh pushed it to about\nA push to much higher than it's been lately ah up around thirty\nSo you can tell we went from Seventy five down wanting yeah I've seen it as a lowly twenty points for I think and the last few weeks um we were around twenty three twenty four start in the week or so were were boosted you know we got we got about I don't know ten basis points\nThereabouts happened pretty quickly to didn't absolutely yeah and uh what usually you would expect a when the ten year treasury spikes higher though you increase in on the tenure in a in a man the portion of the business cycle it ran right now which feels kind of ... I mean we've had\nQuite a bit of growth um we've got GDP recently a four point one percent which is a pretty significant growth\nUm ... what you would expect is a that's kind of a confirmation of growth going forward\nA I think it's probably a little premature to say that uh at the moment if if what we saw this week in the ... move a was truly a confirmation of that growth but uh you know I it's definitely a a good sign normally but one market sell off its a\nHigher interest rates are usually they uh they ... into the um\nThe profitability of a business um cost of capital that uh businesses source to run their operations actually increases you know when they're going to take minutes goes on to for them to feel it\nOh it'll take a minute for them to feel it but the market is always forward looking you know so ah it gets built into the market pretty quick and that's what we saw this week so ah got a few other things that are out in the economy\nPersonal income rose point three percent in August a same mountains in July\nOr just a little bit less than the forecast to point four percent ah but really there's there's not some you know a whole lot to talk about the pace of rental income growth improved a from point seven point eight percent but these are all a relatively muted a University of Michigan consumer sentiment\nUm consumer is still I mean I guess to to a corner phrase strongest horse breath\nCan we say that yeah everybody's got a job all of them around bringing on you know shown come a point of ever heard that term as strong as a horse breath and have her\nWhile ah I'm thinking maybe an hour ... when it when you talk about breath and strength it's usually not a good thing it's not like\nYou know anyway button but in this case it actually is a strong so a consumer sentiment is solid I'm finished them off at a hundred point one three point nine points better than August or you know current conditions are rated favor really at a hundred and Fifteen point too which is up for point nine points\nA consumer expectations also improved to Ninety point five which is a three point four so a current situation a little bit stronger than a\nThan that I'm a expectations going forward and that's the two components of a consumer sentiment that uh is measured by the University of Michigan um\n[noise] I assume manufacturing conditions remains solid and September as well uh I assume drop below sixty uh but uh the index drop below sixty but manufacturing a declined\nUh from sixty one point three fifty nine point nine any time this was above fifty it's actually still expansion area so uh all things considered steal a a a pretty good number one that we looked at every week NBA mortgage applications\nAre held steady in the week I'm following multiple gains over the last few weeks a this is a weekly so there's usually a little bit of volatility you see a move around a good bit\nA total index stayed the same for pre previous week and a small gain and purchases was offset by a slight decline and refinance so ah when we saw interest rates\nMove or move higher in a previous weeks we saw some folks get out and and refinance still amazing to me that anybody's\nAble to refinance and make sense out of it and usually you see that when rates decline\nSo that that ship left the harbor a long time ago you for middle ... [laughter] before before for years you know ... ... I see we're still talking and I'm not really ... [laughter]\nBut he is yeah yeah it doesn't take a whole lot to confuse me showing 'em\nThere's plenty to like and I uh the uh September ice in non manufacturing which is a fancy way to say service index ah suggests the economy has plenty of momentum heading into the fourth quarter a increase from fifty eight point five sixty one point six and these are not percentages it's just kind of a of\nA number on a meter if you will find in the retail is going to pick up obviously right in the holidays are coming and all that yeah it will ah they seasonally adjusted Lee sang ... even though even when you do get those bouncers is going to be relative to previous years ...\nUm but at the same time yeah I mean here's the thing as long as the consumer as long as we see employment situation doing well jobless claims by the way we're the best in fifty years last\nAh but ah you know when you see a jobless claims semi really nervous unemployment low I mean what are we at three point eight percent I think and a half\nMen for a little while um it's it's a great thing that consumers and the consumer feels good about what's going on with their own personal situation so um\n[noise] anyway uh as I mentioned we did have some significant changes in the interest rate the two year will discover that went in\nOn horses were often owned by others who would purchase them and then uh you know the family just how the horses are the ranch been in the family for three generations of last year ... grandfather passed away\nOn as a state had nearly no liquidity in taxes and to be a pay to settle the estate so\nHere we are in a situation or even beyond um ... says last year so it would have been on to the twenty Seventeen rules right which would have been the five point five ... around a figure right\nUm so are you still got to deal with that right ah and buy a liquid meaning uh\nYou you don't I mean if you want to keep the ranch you don't want to just sell it and uh take the proceeds and sounds to me like I'm calling Holly actually want to hang onto the asset so are they being the case they got to scrounge up somewhere absolutely acts money well\nThere are other expenses to not just the taxes but you've got attorneys' fees you've got to administrative fees funeral expenses there are a lot of other costs that sure you need liquid assets to take care of some of those and some of them are immediate right\nYeah so ah you know where the only option they've been left with basically or at least in their own minds has been\nYou know either sell the farm or we can take alone I mean have you changed around again also barn potentially if the\nFirm's worth that much and maybe you take alone um\nDo you know something of that nature if if the pre planning was there you know after the fact it's hard to plan for sure right the journal that's the whole point planning I'm you know something that can be put in place if you're in a situation where you do have a lot of a liquid assets not a lot of cash\n'em or or you know assets that are liquid sitting around such a stocks CDs whatever that you can't get access to 'em there is a life insurance option you can alter my life insurance on yourself to help pay for future liquidity or know that you know there could be an issue in the future sure with having excess cash right\nAnd sometimes that's the least expensive option send a works very well there are so if you've got a\nAssets that are actually more liquid you can uh\nYou can source those to ah create um\nA longer term fix maybe but in term you'd still almost\nAlways be in a spot where you'd have to borrow and you're ready to mortgage against the asset if someone left you in the spot right the key to the conversation today though is how to keep from leaving those you love and the similar spot right exactly so ah it short of borrowing a you know you could borrow for for a short term fix\nA discover whatever assets\nAre there and a very little that you could liquidate and keep the pizza ranch in this far in this uh particular instance um but\nAren't gifting early if you want you know you want us to stay in the family right start gifting shares of it early you know portions of of the ranch or something like that early\nUm you have to respect the gift limits but if you start earlier I'm being able to transfer that ... out of your state right to get below the exemption amount that's an option tail but of course that requires the pre planting we're talking about\nRight now and I think that planning is a little more extensive than just creating the wheel and saying I Want this property to be in my family forever and ever right if you don't do the liquidity part I'm\nEasily find a way in a in a rough spot will guys let's take a real quick break we come

I don't know that we're in the area or stay in the fire ... well I guess because we're taping this there's yeah it'll be the hack of the day it's national I could but he's now\nTalk of ... and how can you talk about the surge day it's not even the same there who knows they did that they're doing around [laughter]\nThey hit earlier in this show that when you tell your husband that he always right I Know I just I don't know why they're doing their own decided to [laughter]\nI'll make sure he's lists I appreciate your uh your attitude [laughter] All right Peter sorry about the whole problem so mistakes you avoid going forward one being house for they already know they are there and he said you know exactly as a bottom have people that haven't done that don't buy more just because the bank says you can\nAnd it was for them to unravel but mass right a downside definitely a possibility and a good time to do it for probably ...\nInstalling the kids ... Jones is twelve hundred dollar ... I see it on the line is hard to spoil a kid at it now and so that falls right into keeping up with the Joneses Jones you straight in and start doing the same thing you want to teach them good sure\nYeah it's yeah or then you're going to the you know where they are now showing you got kids what are the kids going to say when you go back on your word like yeah I Know what we used to say but going forward we're going to try that everybody be a little more responsible and they're going to say that yeah mambo you say you said\nHere happens every ... Bari saving for retirement I Know it's a it's never too early but I'm going to say it's never too late either haven't started yet you might as well get started and\nStart right now our compounding yes yeah starting the earlier you\nStart in a much better much better than having to wait the compounding interest is a phenomenal thing\nYet and really you know in the thirties and forties the forties is your the usually the biggest earning power so you know if you're in your forties right now as you indicated that kids are getting ready to go to school you know maybe start thinking about downsizing they're going to be leaving sure editing seems a little district obviously thinking about downsizing starts talking money away now\nAnd when it gets the earning earning years you can leave and it's just possible\nPut that excess you'll save all not paying such a big mortgage right put it in your retirement\nYep and that the covers a one in the next steps funding college over retirement sometimes that's a mistake a lot of people make as well and we said many times you can borrow for college yet but you can't borrow for retirement that's absolutely true yeah\nAnd uh I mean if you're in real dark straits there's nothing that says that I mean you you such kids will get them in a good school a with a a decent um\nCareer path beyond college and ah they could buy their own way through college and sit down and talk with him now talk with them about their options yeah and and you know obviously if you want to break the uh\nUh the generational issue would show you have already taught your kids to this point uh if you tell them hey look these are the mistakes that I made\nA going forward we want to do differently and we want you to understand why we're making these differences and we expect that you would push it forward into the next generation is well that's a conversation always great\nYou know I'm\nAlso not protecting yourself with life insurance disability insurance not having those can cause major financial devastation so they're usually\nAnd they change over time you know when you're younger you need life insurance term policies generally to help get the kids through college get the mortgage paying if something happens to you but the reality is statistically you're more likely to become disabled and die so not only will become disabled\nAnd you know now only could there be health costs that now that maybe the income goes away to show you know you need to be thinking about that that is more devastating because not to be cavalier but now now you're kind of ... you know the incomes not there but you're also pulling money from the household salary you know\nI'm you're kind of a drag on the on the income but you know so those are things to definitely think about\nYou know and whatever you do try not to ever read your retirement or by getting into a home equity line just to make sure that ends meet and your own I having a another mortgage applied on top of the one you're\nAlready not LA to nine yeah did you get more upside down and then he pulled money out of retirement and you can never make that up and there's the penalties for doing so if you're under fifty nine and a half anyway there you\nGo from a big fancy house to house real quick right yeah absolutely last resort yeah and a coast signing for loans for the kids probably not the best idea either and I teach them to be responsible initially so that you don't have to go sign\nYou never know what kind of measure kids can get you in a you know just coast signing\nWith them or things whether it be an automobile who knows what a loan for a new business I've seen those going before so I'm yeah I'm trying to get the probably the biggest thing you can do for mirrors\nOn beyond being responsible yourself is try to raise some kids that have a little better head on their shoulders when it comes to finance yeah teach them early yeah\nThey need to plan like this sounds a perfect example of someone who needs to plant up and down and go through it with a professional and put a plan in place to alleviate what has been built so far\nNo doubt in and give them ideas as to how they can unravel the mess they might have made with the situation of even current right\nAll right so if you wanted a financial plan you could reach out to Shona or Peter anyone can help you immensely both or see if they use I'm just the dope that runs his radio show\nA and picks a few stocks on the side here and there um but you can reach them at seven seven oh four to nine nine one six six and guys since we don't\nHave a much time left\nLet's let's go to this one question we had that we can probably would cover relatively quickly\nI'm from\nShawna how 'bout that Ross

to do that but they need a little help\nYeah I mean Guatemalans such a beautiful country it's gorgeous but there is a dire poverty there and their families there he won so badly that work there is an industry that they can do and they just need a little how to get started\nThe Democrats will ultimately share the credit proceeding to ruin the lives of Brett Kavanaugh and his family had likely is accuser Christine Blasey Ford Elite media outlets said their part in the facilitates the allegations the Washington Post and the New Yorker and then it was something of a free for all\nOne qualified legal observer professor Alan Dershowitz retired now from Harvard law school a wife along liberal now moving somewhere near the center laid waved to the Democrats cynical miscarriage of this confirmation proceedings my colleague Dennis Prager took a closer look\nLet me read to you from Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz\nAnd his description of what is happening\n... denied the appointment it will be because he has been depicted as a sexual predator who deserves contempt origin impossible in prison that\nHe may no longer be able to teach law coach sports or expect to be treated respectfully he could be forced to resign as current traditional position because having the coat convicted unquote rapist on the benches unseemly\nFor these reasons he now has the right perhaps not a legal rights butter right based on fundamental fairness to have the charges against him put to the test of clear and convincing evidence\nOr some standard close to that\nA judge Kavanaugh been rejected alive illogical all professional grounds before the sordid accusations were leveled he could go back to his life Robert Bork did but if the Senate fails to confirm him now his life will never be the same\nBut this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice is about the most fundamental issue affair issues of fairness this country has faced since the McCarthy Era\nThe American civil liberties union stood strong against McCarthyism by demanding due process and hard evidence but the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote be resolved against the accused nominee\nPut we mail living in age that risks a new form of sexual McCarthyism we must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism liberal Democrats Harvard law professor\nDarker than McCarthy is\nEven though if you read the report of racial Mitchell flew woman who seems to have asked you know very on challenging questions\nThe wall Street Journal published her entire analysis I can only provide bony assessment of Dr forwards allegations in a legal context and the legal context here as my bottom line a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this case is even weaker than that\nThis is from Rachel Mitchell ate a prosecutor of sex crimes tucked the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate though\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor nor do I believe is evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence then to understand the difference folks\nThere there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt but outside of the legal world all you need is the ... I think in the ... from mistaken in civil suits\nThe preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just for ... but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\nThat Republicans seem to show absolutely fairness of the accuser and giving deference to the wavering members in his own caucus delayed the confirmation one vote\nWeek as the FBI made it official inquiries\nGuys with the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice\nNow if in fact we get word that the FBI is done and that should all centers will have the report it's okay to file the notion of closure because that just thirty hours of debate people will have plenty of time to read the report\nThat's right under the Senate rules are there will be at least a an intervening day or the other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cloture vote wouldn't be until the following day so there'll be plenty of time for senators to read the FBI's a supplemental background investigation\nSenator I represented the victim of the sexual assault on a major college campus I Can't say more because of confidentiality I'm very sympathetic to that kind of because the institution of America have not yet adopted to deal with these but that they're changing nevertheless I'm a lawyer like you and I know one\nOf the fear of flying there that that was given to the committee that simply wasn't true it wasn't given by her I was getting by the lawyers her ex boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she is familiar with polygraph\nConsistent with their testimony testimony and this is a lawyer deal could not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one that could be disproven that are very rare and then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there are problems with her testimony\nWell there are some allies of well a ritual Mitchell uh was retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um and I thought that a very professional job\nBut I thought she got the basic facts out to the demonstrated that there are gaps I understand the victims of of trauma can have memory lapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after thirty five years but I just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that uncorroborated\nAllegations should be enough to condemn or a nominee\nSo let's go to the last issue which is Jerry Adler the incoming chairman of the house Judiciary Committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays he will hold each proceedings I say bring those on because they will be laughing stocks about and separately rule I just got into it she said Brett Kavanaugh wide I said he absolutely did not lie about drinking did not lie about devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a senator\nWell I think it's this has gotten a a ridiculous absurd we're talking about in prison as high school yearbook whether he threw ice on somebody at some point in the past um I think they've been unsuccessful in attacking the judges credibility\nAnd feel like a now they're all from this wild goose chase and uh the goalposts as five friend the majority leaves like say a ... continued to move up but it's time to vote\nHere's what Lindsey Graham said on Fox News last like cutting number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats their toes\nAll of them all of them all of them\nPolitically anybody I Know the only people that are open seemingly ... even though there is no senator\nCornyn Joni Ernst agreed with that do you agree with that\nI I agree uh because I think I'm In these red states that President Trump carried a I think that uh I think the judicial I mean I'm Sorry I just I think the Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are confirming what are the ones you just said\nAs the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to\nA duck Cory Gardner who's the chairman this year as a as a basically confirmed\nThat you know I think something very big is going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the visceral rejection of McCarthyism directed at\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw his hat demand judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry what do you think's into a corner\nI don't blame him for being angry and this uh this ridiculous\nAllegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or heard not display the appropriate temperament on the bench this man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nUh there were a couple of times where I think well one time any particular where he asked judge her suitor corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut uh he shouldn't be expected just to take a\nBusiness ladder these allegations of criminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damage she goes family anybody in that position who feels like they've been falsely accused I think would be angry and be justified and I'm a showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be a blight some good shape because of the FBI report not to vote for um judge Kaplan I I I think it will be a huge mistake unless there is direct corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican doesn't support him\nHis or her career done as a Republican I've never seen the base of his way is that the general sense in the ...\nI think you'll see overwhelming support in the caucus for ah for the judge\nIn the middle of this political debacle another letter uploaded it they were from the president of the American bar association Robert Carlson here's my sale it'll colleague Larry Elder remember that letter that the\nPresident of the ab a sense urging the Senate Judiciary committee to hold off voting on\nJudge Kavanaugh until the FBI investigation letter was written by the president of the ... name of Robert crossing turns out Robert ... that I have permission from the standing committee to send that letter and there are unhappy that he sent it without their permission and they're unhappy that people are suggesting that the ... have drawn to support a Brett Kavanaugh they have not\nAnother sets up Trump very nicely\nFor negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come or hopefully with China because they they are the worst abusers of the trade laws in on the planet one of a quick thing Larry I was there at the rose garden when Donald Trump\nHeld a press conference and one of the points you made as he said look I Want to use these tariffs has a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce their ... and I have to say you may not agree with the topic what what is it working because these countries are reducing their care or\nEven a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries and the University of Chicago survey of top economists out Ninety six percent of greed or strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off with NAFTA\nThan the previous trade deal so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped jobs now they're back in Nineteen Ninety two or three or Ninety four when we originally passed at one Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nBut Trump also had a point that it could be approved or make the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement it's now called the U. S. M. C. A. we're not going to call NAFTA any longer but it is a new on North American free trade agreement that will open up orders a between all three countries\nIs modernized because America has a better deal and uh so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing minimum wage out another country should right and that's one of the things I don't like about this do you also got me on that one I've not you know we we won Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan\nSo I'm going to agree with you on that\nOne so on par though this bill lower tariffs and barriers are up for that the candidate has imposed against us and Louis ... and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just in just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of you know as you know

history but who would be in second place and we will leave out the current incumbent President Trump because as of this telling his presidency is still unfolding it would be another president who was up there on Russia more unknowns not Washington\nWho is so great that he seems in approachable and almost like a statue and no not Jefferson with his complexities and as many flaws it would be that fourth Rushmore president President we celebrate today\nThat would be Theodore Roosevelt the all American Boy\n[noise]\n\n\nUse it that you're hearing [noise] it'll be a hard time in the old towns the night [noise] was used by Theodore Roosevelt as something of a theme song why because it was used for his regiment of rough riders before they went to Cuba\nAnd the Spanish American war then played virtually every rally until he got rather sick of it while he was running for governor of New York in Eighteen Ninety eight before he became president of course and I I Need to answer a couple of questions to the very beginning first\nOf all the idea that I call him Theodore Roosevelt and uh not Teddy Roosevelt and he's often no\nWell that's because President Roosevelt always lose to the name teddy when he was a tiny boy he was called ... and he didn't like it\nAnd he never liked being called teddy and he was declared anyone who holds meat Eddie doesn't know me at all\nAnd I certainly hope that by the end of this broadcast you will know President Theodore Roosevelt well\nThere is also great confusion about the pronunciation of his name\nThere are people who say Roosevelt and they will say Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt and there are other people say no no they know that Franklin said Roosevelt because we have all kinds of recordings of him saying but they'll say Theodore Roosevelt\nHe always said Roosevelt he very clearly did and I have become friends with President Roosevelt great granddaughter in other words her a grandmother was President Roosevelt daughter\nAnd I asked her is there any doubt at all that everyone in your family says Roosevelt she says no it's Roosevelt stop with the Roosevelt and then the last question about the title of this very special broadcast on the Michael ... that show calling him the all American Boy\nI I Do that because part of the fascination with President Roosevelt\nIs this boy ... which lasted his entire life he never quite grew up in fact one of the most famous statements about him was made by the British diplomat\nAssess all spring rice who became a very good friend with President Roosevelt when he was the White House and he said you must always remember\nAbout the president that he is about six\nAnd a there were others who are also impressed with his boy ... daily rude the gray evidence who served NPR's cabinet um said on the president's forty\nSix birthday he said you made a good start in life and your friends have great hopes for you when you grow up\nAnd then later six years later in uh Nineteen ten he uh greeted him on his birthday by writing Tim this after a President Roosevelt had been reelected Theodore you are still the same grade overgrown boy as ever\nAnd most movingly of all and I just came across this and it's stunning to me\nIs former President Theodore Roosevelt humbled himself and came to the White House to Vegas favor\nOf a man who defeated him and his last race for the presidency Woodrow Wilson he he didn't like Woodrow Wilson he was referred to Woodrow Wilson as is the real WW stood for weasel words which is quite a thing to say but he came to\nPresident Wilson and the White House in Nineteen Seventeen after America it entered World War one\nAnd President Roosevelt begged him to allow the president she begged the president to allow him President Roosevelt to organize a regiment and lead a regiment at the front\nBecause he wanted to spend his own money to recruit people to get volunteers\nAnd and President Roosevelt time was in his late fifties he wasn't in perfect health and Wilson said no\nBut afterwards he wrote this in his diary he's a great big boy I was charmed by his personality there was a sweetness about him that is very compelling you cannot resist the man\nAnd people felt that way about Theodore Roosevelt for most of his life and part of the reason that he remained an overgrown boy his entire lifetime was because his actual boyhood was at least for his early years so miserable\nHe had a terrible case of Assam as a child\nHe was born to a family of privilege otherwise he might not have even survived\nBut his family had come here with some of the original touch settlers in what was originally called New Amsterdam they came in the middle of sixteen hundreds\nAnd the family was always successful they were prosperous his father Theodore Roosevelt senior was a widely respected community leader and a successful importer of glass\nAnd generally a a very dedicated community minded businessmen\nAnd in terms of asthma a young ... as he hated being called\nA was too sick to attend school and his mother took him to various practitioners who attached mustard plasters at one point they massage his chest so vigorously that it's started to bleed he got electric shocks and none of it seemed to work\nThe only thing that worked\nWas the time he would spend in his father's arms\nAnd he remembered years later I could breathe I couldn't sleep when he had me in his arms my father he got me breath I couldn't sleep when he had me in his arms it got me lungs strength life\nAnd some sense of what his childhood was he was considered well enough to do with his family when he was ten years old\nAnd they went on a grand trip of Europe and some of it was funny he kept a diary of the trip and it's amazing to read it from
