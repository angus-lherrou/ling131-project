might Gallagher God Bless America [noise]\nI think I've said this my whole life because\nI Can't imagine that there are eleven people listening who do not know who Tucker Carlson is\nFinally Tucker I I got to ask you a question how does that feel [noise]\nHave any experience of it at all I mean I you know I have such a tiny light you know I don't really get a sense that people are watching my show to be totally honest with you you know I live with my white down the street from my brother and my dad and my college roommate and I think people every day in my life is not that different but thank you\nWell I Know I you know what it's a beautiful answer and I'm not surprised that came from you I you radiate decency and integrity that is not common in your profession I have absolutely nothing to gain by saying it I'm not looking for a\nJob so [laughter] I may be [laughter] ... [laughter]\nAnyway folks Tucker Carlson of course of a Fox News\nVia the Tucker Carlson Tonight Show on a ... I didn't even know what how to me which as far as I was just Tucker Carlson anyway he has a book out because he he is thoughtful that's the reason that I'm having a mom with regard to visit with a lot of people on television right books God Bless them\nBut the Tucker Carlson is worth reading the book is shipper fools of is a great a great title how selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution so let's talk about your book the book uh folks is up at the dentist Prager dot com so\nWhy does it mean a ruling class who who is in that class\nWell the people that I grew up with 'em\nSo you could be totally clear I'm not much of a populist and I'm certainly not a representative of coal country\nI mean I grew up in ... in Georgetown so it's basically people who have thrive under current economic system if you want to know with\nThe you know if you look around and you and the people you know are richer than they were before the financial crisis of two thousand eight you know you're probably in that group and it's not a slower it's just you know every society is higher higher article because people are higher make dogs are higher mammals are\nSo you're always going to have a relatively small number of people to make a disproportionate number of\nThe question is not going to have a ruling class the question is are they upped the task of ruling in my argument is that the people currently in charge or not and that's why we got Trump\nOkay so so vis vis a vis a very heavy stuff there let me let me dissect this for a second ruling class for you is an economic criterion not a political or purchase these criteria\nWell it is both in his boat if the if you look around the country to three hundred and thirty five million there almost an infinite number of decisions he made about how those people live what they can say what they do for a living in a relatively small number of\nPeople make a disproportionate number of those decisions so the economic decisions are made disproportionally in New York on Wall street in Washington by the Federal Reserve the political decisions are made almost exclusively in Washington ... about what your kids watching TV or see on the Internet or made almost exclusively in California and New York and Los Angeles\nAnd so you know the west side of LA has a lot more influence over the country than the west Side Story though I mean that and by the way I don't I'm not saying that's bad\nI'm just saying if you have more influence over how other people live you ought to consider yourself a steward of the country and you want to make wise decisions not just decision to benefit you in our leadership had and that\nOkay what what in your mind was there a time when the elite were steering the ship in a good direction\nWell I mean is it you know in a democracy you need to start with from birth personal sort of democracy you must have it's correct was it for a functioning democracy that you have\nAn independent self supporting growing middle class you have to have a middle class democracy only works in middle class countries it doesn't work and said Venezuela where you have this dramatic wealth divide because if you give every person the vote\nBut not an economic franchise they punish you by electing people like Hugo Chavez her Nicolas Maduro so you need you need a little flat you can judge\nThe ethic is seeing the wisdom of the ruling class by how well the middle class people beneath them arguing and our middle class is shrinking an absolute terms or life expectancy is in decline\nAnd so that like the most simple measure there is that's all you need to know that our middle class is no longer majority of two thousand Fifteen and the people in charge ought to be worried about that they're not\nAll right so there was only the identical issues and the decline of the middle class and I make ... and ... and told me this is a fair summary of your view a corrupted elite\nWell I think it's probably slightly more complicated and I think there are factors that I don't understand very precisely\nI mean nothing is the results at one cause horse that's always an oversimplification is always the problem when you're reading a lot of stuff so I mean I'm sure there's a lot going on our economy has changed in ways because of automation and the rise of finance the product of no one person's decision I mean this is not a conspiracy I Would say but\nIt's a it's it's a confluence of a bunch of different factors that have converged to hurt the middle class to devalue labor so that the labor of the individuals were much less than it was in Nineteen Seventy because of automation and technology and all of\nThat has made the average person less powerful less at one and\nLess likely to believe that his kids will do better than he will have which is of course the American dream\nAll of that makes our society more volatile and are ruined class job it is to think about stuff like this and to steer the ship in the right direction has ignored all of it has refused to take responsibility for their decisions refused to admit they're even a ruling class or even in charge\nAnd and and that's why we're seeing about ... I mean one big changes which so striking to me as someone who's interested in the aggressive movement and Teddy Roosevelt in in the Arab robber barons what Carnegie Rockefeller Phipps and you know the people who we think of as you know the fat cats\nOf Nineteen fifty they understood themselves to be the ruling class they knew they were the richest most privileged people in the society and they understood that came with responsibilities as well as benefit our current ruling class Jeff Bezos than Mark Zuckerberg getting the Twitter guys and\nThe you know Travis over ... I mean these are kids who have a billion dollars or several but they grew up in the short an act as if they're just like you and me they refused to shoulder the responsibilities that come with the power they wield and that's part of the problem\nWhy would they do differently if they were responsible\nFor the first thing you would do if you're an employer you're running a large corporation is think about the welfare of your own employees\nSo it's always a tell them this is universal on the left when people start talking about abstract\nIdeas rather than concrete solutions in other words if I run Hooper for example I've got one of the largest workforces in the world I think the second largest workforce in the world so before I started lecturing you about climate change or black lives matter\nI with the first thing I Would do is make certain that every one of my employees was treated as well as I could possibly freedom I Would I don't know give them health insurance paying minimum wage I Would do those things because they're my employees and like my own children I'm responsible for them to some extent I Believe that\nIn earlier generations of leaders believe that they were motivated by in part the guilt they felt from their religious convictions they felt they had a duty to other people are currently leaders for example it Hoover don't even claimed them as employees were drivers don't have health insurance they're not super employees they're contractors that part of the gig economy\nAnd so we're letting the most powerful off the hook\nFor their obligations to their fellow man and at the same time we're allowing them to lecture the rest of us as if there are moral superiors it's a very odd arrangements so Travis from looper is totally confident he was a much better person than you even as one third of Hoover drivers will lose money driving for Uber so how does that work exactly I'm baffled\nI'm speaking with Tucker Carlson of Fox News his book just out just to ship a fool's the subtitle is how selfish ruling class just bringing America the brink of revolution [noise]\nThis is not an all or criticism it is only a an observation and I'd like to react to your critique is a critique that would would resume one hundred percent with folks on the left is that fair to say\nNot anymore my critique is one that would have been common among liberals in Nineteen Seventy five when liberals worried about or set they worry about things like concentration of power and free speech and due process\nAnd that these were the liberal obsessions of my childhood because they instinctively sided with the powerless against the power\nForty years later liberals willpower every one of our institutions our biggest institutions academic business political they're all run by cultural liberals all and so now the left has power and they identify with the powerful\nShowed me All right hold on the clock or we go take a break out all your vote that Tucker Carlson a Fox News the book is up for tennis players dot com ship a fool's is the fall for man concise book and we will continue when we return on the gun is Prager show the dentist Springer show\nOf doing anything positive so and they ignored that and I think they know that now\nWhere I ... I feel for me asking you this but I it's it's truly meant out of curiosity 'cause I respect you where do you stand on President Trump\n\nI think that\nUm well I mean just as an overview I agree with you know the ... the majority strong with the overwhelming majority of what Trump says\nUm I think Tom's genius I think you need to understand some records at Trump's genius is not in affecting policy change I don't think he\nHas control over the executive branch his portion of government I don't think he understands how it works I don't think he's gonna learn I don't think he's good at getting his program through Congress settled in Congress wants to get his program into law\nSo on that level Trump is a frustrating president to watch I think that Trump's value ingenious is in raising the question that no one else was willing to raise even think about as a kind of clarity\nVery simple clear he so he will say things like well wait a second you know we had NATO which was this great force for forty years but it existed in order to keep the Soviets were invading Western Europe Cillizza longer exists so why do we still have NATO\nWell I don't know what the answer is that's a totally fair question and one that we all should have been asking since Nineteen Ninety One when the Soviet Union collapsed or why\nWe start Afghanistan seven teen years later or why are we allowing the south Koreans cheat in this trade deal or why don't we build the wall like what's the answer speak slowly so I can understand\nThat says genius being brave enough and clear enough to raise the core questions that we ought to be debating long after Trump's gone those questions will hang in the air and my hope is that someone will answer them and solve those problems but first you need to you need to define what the problems are and I think the Trump has been really good at that\nAll right a final question because I Know I Know your time is limited so you have on guests who I find ah intellectually morally intolerable which is which\nIs fine [laughter] okay\nSo I just want to know what you see their name as listed on your program notes this is who will have um do you think oh my God I Can't believe this or I dread this or you know what this is what I Do for a living and what the hell\nWhy put their names on that list so I'm I'm responsible for that and I just filed like literally a minute before I got on the show our story outline for tonight's show and so I'm involved on there no surprises\nMe because I'm involved from the beginning to the end by the purpose in doing that is ... grows out of my belief that you need to hear the whole argument yes you do that great\nYeah I Try All right Tucker bless you great to be with you and folks is both ship a fool's itself in Venice pregnant on\nRemains freeze duty\nAnd nine twenty the answer\n[noise] lesser news ...\nNew in Washington us secretary of state Mike Pompeo says America takes us parents Saudi run from off the show you seriously bumped ... pump AOL made the comments to journalists after leaving turkey today during a quick visit that included democracy president or anyone Pompeo said or Guam make clear that the Saudis had cooperated with the investigation\nTrump says he sensors voter optimism rivaling twenty sixteen going into the midterm elections\nIn a wide ranging AP interview the president argues his campaigning has helped GOP can as he says he's not take blame Republicans\nShould lose control of the house first lady Melania Trump's plane has been forced to return to Washington amid\nA smoke in a cabin temporarily delaying her trip to a Philadelphia hospital she's making the trip on a second plane meeting with the mothers whose children were infected by opioid abuse when they were still in the womb this is as er into\n\nTwenty [noise] good when they ... have you had a map intimately not turning him down our hand written by monitoring brand name friendly\nAs you make your way less than on any side north bound downtown genetic or seen a little while ago and you get ... from from blending humane town that nothing major they're just ... recovering from earlier travel you hold on the ledge rather\nNot think read my lazier but got me a little bit of news\nThat he needs are way more than when Ron How\nTo handle all get out and look at your forecast for tonight in ... when the traffic ...

honest talk sometimes at the ... the subjects are less intense than others but very revealing today is a less intense but very revealing subject\nAre you ready here it goes\nBeep your honeymoon correctly predict your marriage\n... seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six did you have a great honeymoon and you ended up with\nWith understandable ups and downs great marriage did you have a lousy honeymoon and turned out to be indeed a lousy marriage or a lousy honeymoon with the great marriage or a great honeymoon lousy marriage\nHow accurate is the honeymoon and predicting what happens in a marriage I\nAlways ask well model is no such thing as ... but I I usually ask couples or individual actually used that usually a couple of cars they're divorced I I often ask individuals were divorced\nWhen did you know it was bad it was a bad marriage and it is amazing how often I and I hear that you are\nWell then is to tell you the truth or the honeymoon\nI I Am quite close and it's not my my wife but I'm quite close to a woman who that is exactly what happened in her case\nA a was a very romantic Souter of her they got married fairly quickly and on the honeymoon a love of his awful traits actually appeared and she wondered\nWhat would I guess I'm a male putting words into her mind I I don't know if she did but I assume she wondered who did I marry and it does this portend\nAccurately or am I Am about to experience in their marriage and incidentally if the honeymoon if on the basis of your responses\nI don't find a particular relationship\nBetween the quality of the honeymoon and Michael in any direction it might be a lousy hunting with a great marriage remember a I'm offering that as just as distinct possibility is the other way around I have a larger question\nThat is worth a I think exploring how important is a honeymoon I can see a very good argument for right after the marriage\nJumping into a normal life I can also see a great argument for getting away from every body just having time for the two I I I'm not an advocate here about having a honeymoon I'm not an advocate for having one I think that there are good arguments for for both\nThe or the way you know for six months or something if some people do 'cause they just can't get away at that time but I I don't know the answer I don't know if the honeymoon has\nBeen a a generally positive force in bonding people or irrelevant or even counterproductive I don't I don't have an answer to that\nIt would be interesting study to engage in however but that's not really the question it's it may be the upshot of the hour but it's not the question of the hour the question of the hour is how much related\nUh is was your honeymoon as if to the rest of your marriage wasn't a good predictor\nAll righty\nLet's go to our best in Philadelphia Hi Beth thank you for calling\nTo talk to you good ah\nMy husband and I uh we had over hunting in Bermuda and\nI'm actually just got to go back to it at this summer for the first time after I celebrate ... years and the second time around it was\nLike oh just as amazing as the first time um but that one one funny thing from our I thought whoa had never\nBeen together um prior to our honeymoon we definitely have to get to each other you know little little habits\nLike for example um you know I I really like my sleep and like ... and and you know he'd be waiting and waiting for me in a way that we could start our days activities\nUm but that you know the hunting thing is that the way they get away from everyday life and just kinda like learn a little bit about each other um you know in in ... in ways that we hadn't gotten\nSo you know I I Am for from what you said you were not living together prior to marriage\nFor religious reasons yeah\nSo that you you have just given me another topic for a male female our\nBecause I Wonder if the honeymoon is not more exciting if you didn't live together\nI mean how could not be [laughter]\nI mean that was definitely a a big anticipation for the wedding night for sure [laughter]\nI like you are as your husband is happy as you are\nA is an incredible man that I Know\nWow you are both gotta\n[laughter] that's an honor that is an honor I Would love to meet two of us know when I I really run next time you you've got to come to a speech by mix them in Philadelphia\nOkay All right\nThank you God I Love her demeanor that is great by the way when a wife says to me that my husband is the best man there is I Can't I I Want you to know I feel so happy for both of them\nThat's won every man launched his wife to think he's the best guy in the world\nIs the way it is we don't have the same exact needs from one another that I have explored with you on a number of occasions on the male female our\nBut that and I mean at that and the fact that she's bubbly unhappy sky really a painter but I I'm going to definitely raise that issue about so it's just it's another issue is it\nIs the honeymoon more exciting if you didn't live together 'cause presumably if you live together you've also traveled together okay and let's go to Mike in Chicago level microbes Chicago Dennis Prager\nAgree not to talk to you you're such a beacon of hope and common sense treat them and I appreciate every or else they they\nMake you know why it's a great topic\nOr is it is beautiful girl I think I was a bit of a rebound you know just trying to have some of them are light and broken up and a couple of weeks later she like she was pregnant so I said okay we'll get married\nBecause that's the way I was brought up you know you do but I was really in love with her because I was good because it might the horse and fill our honeymoon was a duck ... that I had planned in Arkansas which she was not interested in but it was very selfish\nOh [laughter] yeah well yeah it is on hold on hold on [laughter]\nThis is truly [noise]\nI haven't done the kind that one I I don't watch\nThe eggs actually I I think you had a better [laughter] I think so yeah [laughter] [laughter] so how did it turned out how'd your marriage turn out\nWe have room beds Marron we haven't in several blind though I think a lot of that has the fact that we will then go to conduct together and the thing that we thought and they weren't together has met a stronger couple and we have I ... well ... where everything to each other\nWell ... ...\nYes thank you what a beautiful called you know what I you know what I realize is missing in this country because of the sick people who produce our a television and movies\nWhen was the last movie or I mean this is not a rhetorical question I made I I'm I mean plus only surprised by the response but when was the last movie or TV\nSitcom or drama\nAbout a beautiful marriage\n\nYoung people for decades now in the United states have not\nBeen shown the beauty of a beautiful marriage\nSo it's no wonder is that marriage it's
