I mean I Know you may know better than I Want what am I trying to say\nI don't ... why don't we agree with Trump did ... and ... and his supporters writer okay\nSo much yes so let me ask you a question what would be how would you characterize fourteen thousand that's two ... worth of people a a A R B you or would you call them guests would you call them\nRefugee and they would actually be have that right ... yeah okay go on are you are okay okay are you for accepting them into the country\nI'm or expecting them under the appropriate I'm an hour or ... that go through every who wouldn't be any American Kid right\nWhat what they are not what they are not what Trump and you could order you've been on what you've probably mainstream media with by looking at that time I think they're carrying electric smallpox looking eradicated almost a year ago the forty years ago they\nAre I I think okay I under your right by the way let\nMe let me see okay so let me say there is there is overheated rhetoric but I Am completely opposed to letting their man\nAnd I believe that the greater threat to America frankly I think it's up to the best of my knowledge anyone who says that they're bringing of smallpox is making a stupid argument okay I agree with you I never heard it but I Believe you that it's being set I'm sure a lot of ... things are being said I operate of smallpox okay\nAll right you're right fine Okay Michael\nI I'm agreeing with you said you don't have to debate me any more if if that is one of the stupidest arguments against this the only arguments against this is not smallpox the only argument against this is this the does America have a border or not that have to control the left essentially believes and open borders 'cause it finds nationalism to beat the testable\nThey find it to testable when you're out of such as to the United states\nThat's not nationalism than you know it and you know\nWait wait where nationalism is not having that nationalism is having nationalism is having borders borders is part of being ...\nMuch much more than that and you know there\nWas one is the much more that's where we may differ I don't think it's more than that I don't know I think that\nYour your your height for protection other quarter thing that not only should we protect the border but the people who want to cross that border our readers can Peter they carry your other alien\nOkay we keep going back to that al ... single right word I'm okay I'm In\nFront of a credit that's now\nOkay that's not shall we talk to you when he called animals who was MS Thirteen Thirteen our animals if you don't believe the Amish Thirteen can be characterized as animals\nI don't know who would be okay I think that the ... so the debate isn't about the debate is not over verbiage even though verbiage matters I agree the debate is over whether the United states of America like any country can have that can have a a a border\nI've can protect its borders the way Michael protects his home in San Francisco and the way I took my home in Los Angeles\nFor America is our home we have a right to say who can come in that's pretty elementary that's what this debate is about if the president's had only use the most congenial language and by the way I Do I have said a thousand times at least\nSo it's a it's one of the rampant lives of the left this is what I mean so a lot of what it's called white violence or the or or a member of the attack was it an Orlando on the gay nightclub what was it attacked by a homophobic wasn't he didn't even know was a gay nightclub\nBut it's all depicted as homophobia that's what I mean this is what I mean by by the lying media and\nUh with regard to violence yes there are individual ... there are individuals with so called right wing agendas of committed acts act of violence there there they are outliers worth despicable ... usually sick but nevertheless they are what they are\nBut with regard to the daily attacks of of screaming at people uh at shutting down ... ... let me let me give you one example which I think ... the entire issue universities I have a picture I'm going to put it up on the I'm\nOn our Facebook page will put it up a trigger you page will put it up but that is pretty good dot com took a picture last night of the guys two of the guys who guarded me at Colorado State

such guards at a at a university why do only conservative speakers need armed guards at universities why would that be if they just as much violence from the wife is from the left why why is that how can the most radical left wing speaker meets no guards at a university\nWhy did what Ben Shapiro went to Berkeley they spent six hundred thousand dollars for a yarmulke wearing Orthodox Jew to show up at Berkeley\nSo stuck with your lives please there's no comparison there is no comparison yesterday or individual despicable acts of violence by right wing or ...

a lot of great issues the reason for this hour is that many people have a map\nThey know exactly where they are but they don't know where to go that is by the way that's the given in life we don't know where to go we have to be guided\nTo where it is best to go morally and in terms of happiness in terms of meaning in terms of many things so this is a big to be cold I guess the map show\nOr the where to go on the map show but it's the ultimate issues hour and I won't give you all again I'm Dennis Prager thank you for being with me so of course anti Semitism is in the news so let's deal with it on the ultimate issues hour\nAnd I will offer you some thoughts I have written a book it's in its third edition it has never been out of print I began to woo\nHoo many many years ago and it's been updated and updated enough data but the central thesis is identical to the original lift throats in each subject unfortunately it is the greatest hatred in history a greater percentage of Jews have been murdered than any other\nUh like X. than the group that we can is that we know of and uh it is a\nUnique aspect to this is key the unique aspect of Jewish hatred whose name is anti Semitism ... got the name anti Semitism in the Eighteen seventies and Germany\nAnd the unique aspect is that it is always annihilation missed or extermination is people ate Jews lump them all wiped out they don't want them and slaves were persecuted\nThey well the White House to\nAdd to the ... thing in every generation that has been the case there's been a group that as well to to annihilate two Jewish babies therefore or is targeted as they were ... ...\nIt's all it's played a little bit about that they put the book is why the Jews the reason for the Semitism the greatest predictor of evil\nAnd I I think you'll find it riveting why the Jews wrote it with Rob I chose to look in many many many years ago and it's been updated enough that if the third or fourth addition published by one of the free publishers Simon and Schuster climate of troops there\nAnd Harper Collins and Rick Murray regularly is published by Bible coming from a beautiful job that motivated [noise]\nSo I have a question for you\nAs I can use them for that to some so I'd like you to call and we're told repeatedly today that there's this tremendous growth in anti Semitism in the United states\nUh so I have two questions one do you think that that is true whether you're a Jew or not a Jew I Want you to to tell me what you think do you experience it if you're not Jewish I mean are you a hearing more a Jew hatred in and talk with Jews are not present\nA if you're a Jew or you're experiencing\nAn anti Semitism at work or\nOn your try from home or anywhere else I I have not even my mail and ... I'm I'm pretty well known in the United states and\nWay of types of music mail I mean there are others who do I have not saying that they don't metal tonight for a moment but I get very very little ... I've not seen any increase the people who hate me hate me because I'm a conservative not because I'm a Jew\nSo I uh I'm I'm just curious I really am curious maybe I Am not aware\nOf this increase that is allegedly and maybe factor we taking place I Know what you're taking place on college campuses that that but that's all from the left and from Islamic students that's not that stuff from the right but that is true if one wants to identify\nOr anti Semitism and it's increasing you say well that's anti Israel yeah but there there was very little difference okay if the only state on earth you target is the only Jewish state on Earth Day and I'm Sorry but that is anti Semitic okay let's please save me said me the uh the nonsense\nThere are two hundred and something countries but the only one that I work to it destroys the Jewish state but I don't dislike Jews oh okay so you don't dislike Jews it doesn't matter [laughter] it's nice if it does it does it mean dislike Jews means work works to when I elite that how's that\nSo yes there has been I there is an increase on anti Semitism on the American campus but that's not what the people who say visiting present Semitism are talking about they they think this and they claim as an anti Semitism that as massively increased from the right\nWhereas on the campus it's from the left and from a mummy many Muslim students 'cause it's it's target specifically Israel there were students who were afraid to wear Jewish though\nThere are there are students who are afraid to where you know I'm a college campus but other\nDo you believe that this is in on the increase and what is your take on this uh this whole issue\nWhat eight Prager seven seven six is the ultimate issues our age seven seven you know watch on it's been too long I needed I crave it give us the eight seven seven jingle\nOur eyes very nice job right out okay that's good okay very good show I'm joined by the way of showing you should know\nSang that compose that and played it on every one of the instruments [noise] marketable achieving okay he didn't market spring Texas hello mark that us prayer\nI'm more I think there is an ... unit that\nThere is an increase in at seven minutes President Obama almost a hundred percent right Louis Farrakhan Iran's they'll\nSay well how does it all and those things in Al Sharpton mainstream and actually in the platform and does that make credit or they feel that it's OK entirely\nAnd I personally had um we had our playground at our and a guy\nCan out by\nSomeone who wrote what is all over it and we had it ... all over the playground [noise] um when did that happen it happened in the middle of the Obama years [noise]\nAll right let me react I I I just want to say okay this is an important I thank you for calling I don't agree I don't blame President Obama for an increase in anti Semitism and I don't blame the President Trump\nAnd I don't think that conservatives should play the cards that the left does even though it's tempting I don't think Obama increase the anti Semitism and I don't think that um that the President Trump as I Do think that President Obama increased racial tension in the country\nHe could he could have in the course of his eight years Reid reassured a\nBlack America that this is a really good country\nInstead he said that racism is in our DNA spoke about Ferguson even though the the white policemen was acquitted by largely black Drury\nUp because he acted completely in self defense for Michael Brown was not an act of racism whatsoever for the president to say ...\nWas a disgrace to have a Al Sharpton visit him as often as he did Al Al Sharpton was one of the instigators of the only per room in American history that word is a minute is used by Brandeis University historian\nIn describing the events in Brooklyn New York and crown heights when blacks attack Jews\nAre and they they were done by Al Sharpton\nAnd pat so yes but I don't believe that President Obama's responsible for um for increasing if ... who's a racial tension yes did he leave the country worse than you found it in every way possible I Believe so\nA you want to say it's a it's it's it's kids that have this status that same early over you know you look at Israel\nK. thing well of adding to you and say well I read that\nKind of success and learning that bought me a kind of society that Israel as\nA so that that's basically it it it's sort of a a in a way that stance against people who have\nA date or study hard work and whatever and so it that we call the expressions\nYou're right you're you're explaining it yeah yeah All right I I think\nYou're explaining it uh and I think there is that that is part of it you should all I'll read the Israel\nTest by George Gilbert who is of course not Jewish and or she has five minute video at ... university the Israel test and he uh he explains that point in his unique eloquence with his unique eloquence that he is he's a ... one of the major thinkers in my in my one of the major ten thinkers living\nSo he uh he he ... the resentment if you if you resent\nSuccess not just financial but also financial then that's part of what comprises anti Semitism but anti Semitism of course as I point out has the elimination element you know why I liked him the guy in Pittsburgh settled Jews must die\nThat is very rare among ethnic bigotry there are millions ethic bigotry and the world this try this try this nation hate this nation this religion hates his religion cetera et cetera but the notion that every one of them must die that is such a unique to July ...\nThat's why Hitler thought that Jewish babies must die\nSo it's a it's been a ... it's a very serious\nHatred but again my my question is do you think it's increasing in the United states where do you think that that's a exaggerated I I it is increasing I'm a ... but it's increasing to my opinion on the left aware or\nAnti Zionism had substituted for anti Semitism anti Zionism is a form of anti Semitism or folks if if you have any intellectual integrity you look knowledge that I'll\nJust say that the only state in the world the only people on earth who have no rights will country all the Jews is anti Semitic okay if you if you think Italians don't have a right to Italy then you're right it's hard to tell you and even if you love pizza and you love a Vivaldi and\nAre you love a uh uh the tally in opera\nYou know ... and ... it's relevant okay even if you if it if you get a polio vaccine you could still be a an anti Semite by the way these people to give you an idea of irrationality all Jews must die so full Jews must die that this guy might have had polio\nIt was a Jew develop the of the polio vaccine and it's so many other medicines\nAll Jews must die but I still like to benefit from all of their medical uh discoveries\nA lot of it it's not like these guys think rationally anyway if you read about this guy in
