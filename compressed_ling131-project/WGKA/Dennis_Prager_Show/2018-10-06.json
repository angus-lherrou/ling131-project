ultimately share the credit proceeding to ruin the lives of Brett Kavanaugh and his family\nHad likely is accuser Christine Blasey Ford the elite media outlets said their part in the facilitates them the allegations the Washington Post and the New Yorker and then it was something of a free for all\nWhite unqualified legal observer professor Alan Dershowitz retired now from Harvard law school a lifelong liberal now moving somewhere near the center late waved to the Democrats cynical miscarriage of this confirmation proceedings my colleague Dennis Prager took a closer look\nLet me read to you from Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz\nAnd his description of what was happening\n... denied the employment it will be because he has been depicted as a sexual predator who deserves contempt origin impossible in prison\nHe may no longer be able to teach law coach sports or expect to be treated respectfully he could be forced to resign his current traditional position because having a cold convicted unquote rapist on the benches unseemly\nFor these reasons he now has the right perhaps metal legal rights butter rights based on fundamental fairness to have the charges against him put to the test of clear and convincing evidence or some standard close to that\nA judge Kavanaugh been rejected an ideological professional grounds before the sordid accusations were leveled he could go back to his life Robert Bork did but if the Senate fails to confirm him now his life will never be the same\nBut this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice is about the most fundamental issue affair issues of fairness this country has faced since the McCarthy Era the American civil liberties union stood strolling\nIt gets McCarthyism by demanding due process and hard evidence but the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote be resolved against the accused nominee\nPut we mail living in the age that risks a new form of sexual McCarthyism we must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism liberal Democrats Harvard law professor\nDarker than McCarthy is\nEven know if you read the report of racial Mitchell woman who seems to have asked you know put very on challenging questions\nThe wall Street Journal published her entire analysis I can only provide bunny assessment of talked to Ford's allegations in a legal context and the legal context here as my bottom line he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this case is even weaker than that\nThis is from Rachel Mitchell ate a prosecutor of sex crimes tucked the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate though\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee newer nor do I believe is the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard you understand the difference folks\nThere there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt but outside of the legal world oh you mean as the ... I think in the ... from mistaken in civil suits\nThe preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just for ... but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\nThat Republicans ... to show absolutely fairness of the accuser and giving deference to the wavering members in his own caucus delayed the confirmation one vote\nWeek as the FBI made it official inquiries\nGuys with the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate and also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice\nNow if in fact we get word that the FBI has done and that should all centers will have their report it's okay to file the notion of culture because that says thirty hours of debate people will have plenty of time to read the report\nThat's right down to the Senate rules are there will be at least a an intervening day or the other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cloture vote wouldn't be until the following day so there'll be plenty of time for senators to read the FBI's a supplemental background investigation\nCenter I represented the victim of the sexual assault on a major college campus I catch a more because of confidentiality I'm very sympathetic to victims because the institution of America have not yet adopted to deal with these but that they're changing nevertheless I'm a lawyer like you and I know one\nOf the fear of flying narrative that was given to the committee that simply wasn't true it wasn't given by her I was getting by the lawyers her ex boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she is familiar with polygraphs inconsistent with her testimony testimony and this is a lawyer deal\nCould not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one that could be disproven\nThat's very rare and then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there are problems with her testimony\nWell there are some allies of well a ritual Mitchell uh was retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um\nAnd I thought that a very professional job\nBut I thought she got the basic facts out to the demonstrated that there are gaps I understand the victims of of trauma can have memory lapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after thirty five years but I just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that uncorroborated\nAllegations should be enough to condemn or a nomination\nSo let's go to the last issue which is Jerry now lower the incoming chairman of the house Judiciary Committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays he will hold each month proceedings I say bring those on because they will be laughing stock about Seventy rule I just got into it she said Brett Kavanaugh wide I said he absolutely did not lie about drinking did not lie about devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a senator\nWell I think it's this has gotten a a ridiculous absurd we're talking about in prison as high school yearbook whether he threw ice on somebody at some point in the past um I think they've been unsuccessful in attacking the judges credibility\nAnd feel like a now they're all from this wild goose chase and uh the goalposts as five friend the majority leader like say a ... continued to move a but it's time to vote\nHere's what Lindsey Graham said on Fox News last night ... number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats I think their test\nAll of them all of them all of them\nPolitically you know the only thing that are open seemingly the even though there is no senator\nCornyn Joni Ernst agreed with that do you agree with that I I agree uh because I think I'm In these red states that President Trump carried a I think that uh I think the judicial I mean I'm Sorry I just I think\nThe Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are confirming what a ones he just said\nAs the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to\nA duck Cory Gardner who's the chairman this year as a as bad as basically confirmed\nThat you know I think things very big ... going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the visceral rejection of McCarthyism directed at\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because if they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw his hat demand judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry or what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and uh this uh this ridiculous allegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or hug not display the appropriate temperament on the bench this man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his\nGood name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately uh there were a couple of times where I think well one time and in particular where he asked judge or to their corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do but he shouldn't be expected just to take\nA business ladder these allegations of criminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position who feels like they've been falsely accused I think would be angry and be justified in showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be a blight some good shape because of the FBI report not to vote for\nUm judge Kaplan I I think it will be a huge mistake unless they're a threat corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican doesn't support him his or her career done as a Republican I've never seen the base this way is that the general sense in the ...\nI think you'll see overwhelming support in the caucus for uh for the judge\nIn the middle of this political debacle another letter blurred at they were from the president of the American bar association Robert Carlson here's my Salem College Larry Elder remember that letter that the\nPresident of the ab a sense urging the Senate Judiciary committee to hold off voting on\nJudge Kavanaugh until the FBI investigation and then it was written by the president of the ... name of Robert crossing turns out Robert ... did not have permission from the standing committee to send that letter and they're unhappy that he sent it without their permission and they're unhappy that people are suggesting that the idea has withdrawn its support of Brett Kavanaugh they have not\nThey didn't want to make and now they're sets up very nicely\nFor negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come to hopefully with China because they they are the worst uh you know abusers of betrayed laws and on the planet one other quick thing Larry I was there yet the rose garden when Donald Trump\nHad his part Scott Brown is one of the points you made his he said look I Want to use these tariffs has a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce their tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with a tactic but boy is it working because these countries are reducing their ...\nEven a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries and the University of Chicago survey of top economists found Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off with NAFTA\nThan the previous trade deals so when President Trump keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI did it you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped draft now they're back in Nineteen Ninety two or three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved or make the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement is now called the U. S. M. C. A. we're not going to call NAFTA any longer but it is a new a North American trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries\nIt is modernized and give us Americans a better deal and\nSo I I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing a minimum wage on other countries should right and that's one of the things I don't like about this deal so there you got me on that one that's not you know we would we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics and this plan a show I'm going to agree with you on that\nOne and so on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for the candidate has imposed against us and Louis terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nNot just one just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of you know as you know we've talked about this on your show before the war and more of what Americans producers called intellectual property we produce\nComputer software we Patton sent copyrights and technologies and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and some and certainly trying on and many other countries and Asian countries they steal our intellectual property and this new ah alcohol at the U.S a Shiite right\nAs much better protections for not an American\nIntellectual property so countries are going to use our products they actually pay for them was under the entire interview with economist Stephen Moore on Tylenol review dot com coming up\nOn an alien hours of taxpayer money went to prepare religion's America's religion for the discovery of extra terrestrial life\nSounding the alarm on bureaucratic waste when the total review return home it\nGood news you are not stuck with your health care plan\nReally you have a choice and it's a great when it's called met a share and if you've heard about it and wondered what exactly it is it's a way that people share their health care bills and these are people who have a common face you want to be part of something beautiful that not only meat for their health care needs but the needs of others too\nAnd it's people who love to save money big time ... members typically save\nFive hundred dollars a month per family on their health care costs that is a life changing for people so this could be for you maybe it's what you've been looking for a way to pay health care bills it's not only very smart financially but it's even profound met a series of non profit with four hundred thousand members nationwide to pray for and share with each other\nSo yeah so you're not stuck there is another way and it could save you a lot find\nOut more call a three three thirty nine Bible that the three three thirty nine Bible a three three thirty nine Bible\nMay be hard to believe but people just like you are already saving money dipping or makes it easy symbols savings plan teaches you how to start saving without going overboard so you don't need to do the car and started rollerblading to work\nDon't need to start forging wild berries skeptical but these are actually pretty good you don't need to do your organs on the black market lie that this is going to hurt\n\nYou don't need to rent out your apartment to drifters firewood and your\nAnd your closet door you\nJust need an Internet connection [noise] don't get left behind you don't your personal savings plan with the tips and tools on feeding upping not or that\nYou don't need to sell all your belongings and live in a calm you read it along to all of us now Tom brought you by the American Institute of CPAs and the ad council\n[noise] comes a record over the years these amendments law injustice we used to\nAs they cost fishermen that can Supreme Court come along and Trump that constitutional amendment by calling it unconstitutional\nThey can the U.S Supreme Court and say that an activist state is unconstitutional [noise] one of the interesting issues here will be how the court abuse the marriage issue and that's why it's so important\nThat you see the nominees to the Supreme Court um United States that have conservative judicial philosophy that will respect the will of the people and deliberate process unless the act is really unconstitutional and not make pulse and social policy or political policy from the bench\nThe American Center for Law Justice to defend our religious liberties learn more about the American Center for law and justice on our website\nAt the OJ done for\nThe L.

don't miss out on a resource many innovative companies have already discovered go to graduate dot org and to learn how to find cultivate and trained as great pool of untapped rookie by the ad council of graduate dot org\n[noise]\nWelcome back to review by us despite the darkness we've witnessed on Capitol Hill this past week we saw some light on Thursday shining on a very appropriate place from time about our stores elementary and middle schools high schools all across this great country\nIt would bring your Bible to school day here's my Salem College Joe Walsh gym daily poke us on the family\nEducate in the late ... what is bring your eyes open a school that\nWe started this five years ago we had eight thousand children the first year participate last year we had five hundred and fifty two thousand allow\nChildren participate it's the elementary school junior high high school even college kids both from public schools as well as Christian schools but it's just to set aside a day the kind of flex your religious liberty McGough a little bit and then there is this is totally constitutional\nTo simply bring your Bible to school and read it and nobody can take it away and that's\nOne of the great things about living in America but oftentimes a school administrator or a teacher will come up and say hey you can't do that it's illegal right have a one sheet from alliance defending freedom\nAnd people can print that at the website they give it to the teacher and I go oh okay it looks like it's a way to go ahead and that's typically have the day goes in and you're facing these now\nUh are usually pulling together a little table talk Bible study at lunch at school they're reading the book uh John or something it's self directed yeah so they do whatever they want to do but\nAt the website bring your Bible dot org we have ideas for youth pastors and test for teachers and parents on what to do\nBut it needs is broken now and and other things like cutting government regulations us would have done and the secretary of state's office with all of our systems and that's what I Want to do through the whole executive branches governor and I think a lot of those things line up with him\nTalking to secretary of state Brian Kemp Republican candidate for governor of Georgia let's talk about illegals I you brought that up just now it's a big topic for me a lot of Georgians\nAnd I saw a recent article in the AJC that pointed out that uh Atlanta public schools as an example where my kids go to school\nIs going to turn a blind eye to a legal and allow them to go to school and allow them to break the laws and take advantage of taxpayers here in Georgia\nMade me fairly angry as a voter in a taxpayer because I have to go through a mountain the paperwork every year just to get my kids were qualified for the school I'm legal I pay taxes yet these people walk across the border how do we deal with that in Georgia as a whole\nUnder a governor camp administration\nWell the first and foremost you not have a strong public safety reform platform going after criminal illegals me one of the things that we have in our\nState is we have two different things we're dealing with federal prosecutors saying publicly that\nThe Mexican drug cartel has created the distribution of in the state of Georgia for you know all these illegal activities that are driven by the drug trade when you think about math heroin whatever it is is is truly an epidemic in our state is contributing\nTo the opioid epidemic there is also contributing to sex trafficking and if anything that drives you know illegal\nActivities for financial gain and I'm absolutely going to go after that I had developed to different plans one stop and dismantle plan to go after these you know illegal cartels that are doing business here and putting the hammer down on them given law enforcement the tools they need to do that\nIn a support local prosecutors in in doing that as well no matter where they are no matter what ZIP Code it is because there's you know over Seventy thousand\nGang members here as well and that's the second thing that we have to go after a is stopping and dismantling gang so that's that's one part of something that's driven by illegal immigration from a criminal element\nAnd then you have the other side which really you have to do with the federal level which is revamping the system is one reason I supported\nSenator David produced raise that really ... the system to end chain migration\nTo secure the border so we can have a legal system where people can come here there's a lot of legal\nNow citizens in the United states that are frustrated by people that have such easy access illegally because they waited they went through the process in the in the correct way and they now are taxpayers just like we are and when you're you know allowing people that are here illegally to get\nGovernment benefits like education you know access to the ... scholarship\nFree medical care by just simply setting foot in an emergency room I mean we're paying that bill you know you and I are paying the bill other working Jordan's are paying that bill\nI think people are really frustrated by that I mean we certainly are you know look I'm sympathetic to what people want to come to our country but we can go to other countries and take our kids ... illegally and get free health care or free education to\nGo to Mexico they're very strict as Trump says he wants it to be here in America and we're at a yet we're hypocritical in that argument I what is it in Georgia though in your estimation that we fail to do because I think the problem\nOf illegal immigration gangs crime drug trafficking sex trafficking all of that is getting worse I think that's a fair statement\nWhat what has allowed that to happen if you could put your finger on one not not that I Know there are many issues but the one big issue politically or policy wise what I'm saying\nI think politics ... you know times of London to white honestly I'm you know the end you're seeing this more with the the radical socialist part of the Democratic party\nIn my opinion that embrace things like sanctuary cities or California being a sanctuary state where they're just saying hey look\nCome to our state if you're illegal we're not going to come after you in any way and you know we welcome you here will you know that is going to be very expensive for the taxpayers pluses rake in federal law\nUm and that's just you know not the way this country works thankfully door does not like that but we do have\nCommunities around the state that either publically or quietly or a break embracing that by not you know speaking to ice when they arrest someone that's you know here legally not being willing to hold an individual and so I can get there to start the deportation process\nAnd you know the man I talked to somebody the other day\nThere were they were upset because you know somebody they knew that they said was a good person that was here illegally will I'm sure that they probably were but they were driving without a driver's license which means I had no insurance and they got pulled over and they got arrested in the guy's going to get deported but it's like I told him I said you know\nI hate it for the guy but he's breaking the law\nHe's here legally he doesn't have a driver's license and if he had it you are one of my children we'd be stuck holding the bag because he has no insurance and get in and that's you know it's a it's a tough it's a tough deal and it's got to be tackled at the federal level but I think there's things that we can do at the state level especially on the criminal side\nTo be able to go after him and that's what we need to do it on the flip side of that I'm also a strong supporter of the age to a an age to be these are programs\nSo we have yes workers in this country and in areas where we need them like in agriculture they'll get our crops out of the field very hard finding you know American citizens that will do that work\nWe need these workers there is a legal process for them to come in and work and get paid in return home and come back\nThe next year the problem is that that system is old an antiquated the red tape needs to be cut out of it is very expensive and so we need to do our farmers of favor when we do immigration or when they do immigration reform\nAt the federal level that needs to be in my opinion part of it quite honestly as like when I was talking to the senator Perdue the other day I think it was him there was telling me\nYou know the Democrats rail about this they had the opportunity and the votes with the Republicans to do immigration reform one President Obama was there and they control both houses of Congress and they wouldn't do it do any good at it is a good political argument\nTo a good argument to start people up but it doesn't actually when when you get down to what the American voter wants the vast majority of American people whether they're Democrat or Republican don't believe truly in any of this illegal immigration debate that's going on\nWell and I think it's frustrating for for parents you know now I'm getting that age where my daughters are you know I have one in one in college one you know to more\nThat will be going and you have other Jordans and they can't get their kids in University of Georgia, Georgia tech or some other institutions and struggle with calls and you know we have people running for office that want to give\nThe HOPE Scholarship does to people that are here illegally that aren't us citizens living that's outrage\nWe're talking to secretary of state Brian Kemp a Republican\nFor governor coming up I Want to get into an article that that\nKind of play do throughout the primary but it's still circulating it's part of Stacey Abrams the Democrats' campaign against you saying that you two blocks from people regularly so we'll continue with that and just a moment we want to get your response as we continue with Brian Kemp [noise]\nDecision twenty eight teams from am nine twenty anti [noise]\nHere no witnessing the far left

the best right\nHealth markets offers that free service with access to thousands on Medicare plans plans I can eliminate you're out of pocket cost plans with zero dollar premiums and we didn't plan to pay you back\nSo you know there's not much to secretary of state can do on that I think from a budget standpoint was frustrating to me is that a lot of the the money that licensees or paying into the system is being diverted the other places to buy for other things can you start in that as governor\nOh well that's ... you can you can recommend in your budget\nWhat you think is appropriate but then when it goes through the legislative process they have the final say no the governor the governor has a big part of that so I think you can definitely work on that\nThe legislature has there say as well and a lot of times they don't see eye to eye with what I Want to do or the or what the governor wants to do us part of the whole negotiation we've\nGot about ... seconds left I Want to get two questions out from Facebook or the first one is on guns of Alan put on Facebook since uh he meaning secretary camp has acknowledged being for constitutional Cary what what you do to ensure legislation will be introduced in the next session if you become governor camp\n... strong supporter of the second amendment ... on us you do not carry and people have the right to toss station will carry a I think the big question is you know how would a piece of that legislation be written so I'll be working with the legislature to continue to move the needle on the accessibility of Jordan's to express their\nFreedoms and the second amendment to protect their family and to continue to be a strong state that ... that that advocates for that so definitely and I have a commitment to do that all worked with bugs like you know Georgia carry great organization that's that's probably as knowledgeable as anyone to get that done US law got our doors from them\nAnd then on religious freedom laws governor deal vetoed a very controversial law some would say his veto saved business to some extent in Georgia from us being vetoed horror boycotted for what's your position on those ... it's kind of bills would you have done the same as governor deal and the ... the\n... I've been very clear from the start the spike again Atlanta paper saying I'm changing my position my positions never changed I committed to sign and a reference to what's in the federal statute so the exact same language we have in the federal law we would put that in place to in Georgia law\nThat that is what governor deal ... voted for and Congress is what he said he would signed as governor and that was never put on his desk there was always more added to it which is the reason he vetoed\nSo I have a commitment to sun just that anything more anything less will not work\nBut if you do just that it gives the protection it absolutely does not discriminate and it will not run business away and that's what we're going to do so we can get this behind us and move on\nSecretary of state Brian

coverage of the twenty Eighteen\nElection for governor we now have had met the libertarian candidate for governor of Georgia Tech great to have you\nSay you very much for having me Brian really uh I I really appreciate sailing media taking notes that I'm actually running for governor in Georgia\nWell let's let's talk about taking notes because there was a new landmark pole and let me just first say I I hate polls I didn't pull their holy an addict inadequate and an accurate in this day and age but to that point that's been the news or the governor's race this week showing a dead heat between\nSecretary of state Brian Kemp the Republican for governor Stacey Abrams the Democrat that camp up two points\nYou somewhere in the two to three percent range as the libertarian candidate or just your reaction to that landmark poll\nUm since since you can't take a poll on a cell phone it's all landlines and mostly with people who have landlines are are not\nLike up to speed as far as technologically speaking so I don't trust those either um again what's going to happen in this election is it will throw it into a runoff race but at least I'll be able to be on stage giving my information about why the two party system is dead and broken and needs to be replaced\nThe I Want to give you plenty of time on that 'cause I I agree with you I'm not a Republican or democratic probably lean more libertarian but I I don't identify with any party or any group because that means I buy in to a hundred percent of everything everybody says I Want to get to that in a second but the problem we have\nAnd I get a lot of flak on this the two party system seems to be dead in terms of its effectiveness of the people in Georgia the people in this country but it seems to be instructive as to who wins it's either the Democrat or the Republican Ninety nine plus percent of the time and sometimes the libertarian leans more Republican\nIn in in their positions and it can be a spoiler leaving liberalism to prevail what what do you say to that\nI Will say that there are plenty of of um of libertarians are are strongly conservative than the conservatism actually trying to runs\nIn the same vein as many of the conservative Republican point however most of the most Republicans I Know actually lean conservatively towards original intent constitutional ism number one and number two when they're talking like of financial fiscal conservatism and preservation of of\nYou know the American as we grew up in\nI I have to say that there are a lot of candidates running the Georgia Libertarian Party you really were kind of more Republican just not accepted as Republicans by the Republican Party so\nI'm not really sure how to address that other than the more people know about what libertarianism stands for and what it actually means the more people will identify with the I must republic are must be a libertarian I'm not a Democrat or Republican\nThe essence of being a libertarian is leave me alone don't tell me what to do and don't do all my stuff\nYeah I and a lot of Americans go for that message it's amazing to me that the Libertarian Party doesn't get more traction at least some races\nAnd here's how it works with Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home\nSo afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if

now at ... am nine twenty the answer dot com used the promos code pastor [noise]\nRyan Crabtree on eight and nine twenty the answer had met with is the libertarian candidate for governor of Georgia\nOr ten we're continuing as we promised the audience on issues let's start and just rattle off as many as we can get to I Know you want to get to some of the amendments that are very dangerous for Georgians that I'm interested in your opinion on that so we'll try to cram all of that into the segment guns I'm Stacey Abrams the anti gun candidate obviously Brian camp\nThe Republican he carries his gun everywhere it's almost become a running joke where where do you stand in the Libertarian Party on guns and gun rights in the state of Georgia\nI Would like to start out by saying the bill of rights is a busy partial list of rights that we have an Aaron Lee that were given by our readers according to the preamble of the nation my position on gun control is a firmer grip a balanced stance and good site alignment is what\nBone federal about [laughter] that I should amend the occasion right shall not be infringed on all of the founding fathers said that you know owning firearms is against Iran ethical government and it's getting more and more critical that more people own guns\nAnd that answer doesn't surprise me coming or libertarian it's it's a leave me alone or which is is kind of stuff yeah don't take my stuff or so who are let's talk about marijuana recreational marijuana legal for everybody to state of Georgia where do you where do you stand on that uh\nI totally well this is going to be kind of a long answer because I've been in the marijuana space for at least five or six years actually at the committee hearings going through all the elites hope stuff\nAnd at what we're gonna talk first about recreation are ready to talk about medical first I Want to push for in the home growth your medical patients and have a split from your doctor said that you can use\nCannabis for medical purposes you should be able to grow to at home by yourself plant in the closet with a plant like right pardon me as far as recreational no no one\nUm there are so many people I think Seventy percent of Americans are taking some sort of a I'm Sorry one in seven Americans take some kind of medication for some kind of a mental disorder either depression or anxiety or he TST or whatever\nKind of a ... even if it's recreational can can cure all of those problems not not to mention all the other medical conditions that I'm kind of us can treat not just highly make you feel better but actually here\nSo I I Want to see marijuana legal in all aspects\nI Would just got back from from Denver and in Denver estate taxes recreational Fifteen Percent on on the distribution level and then another ten percent at these sales level and you know Colorado is has a booming economy does and and just the fact that it's a plant that God gave us you know genesis you know blah blah blah\nUm it it is ridiculous the human rights to be happy\nAfter ... listen to me on the on the radio or following me on on digital social media I\nI'm I'm always pro recreational marijuana has been for very long time I think it's ridiculous thing it's less dangerous than alcohol that's always been my opinion and I ... as the gateway erode yeah which is that the reason you think a lot of Georgians do want recreate especially ... back in the way\nPropaganda um you know the propaganda started in Nineteen thirty five with um reefer madness\nAnd if you look at the marijuana issue is really all about what what the deal is with crony capitalism at large a group of of um industrial is basically had the legislation than marijuana stamp act in Nineteen thirty seven pass on the person's was dupont coupons Hatton for nylon\nWas issued February Nineteen thirty seven the marijuana stamp act was enacted in November of Nineteen thirty seven and he was their lobbying to have that done\nTo protect his nylon\nBefore nylon rope is the best thing all of the founding fathers said basically that that that our strength of America was was the power of him\nSo anyway um emphasis being suppressed because it interferes with cotton and fiber and interferes with with oil and interferes with ... medicines you know the FDA approved drugs and say here's here's what eight years of other things that people\nYou're basically begging of monopoly is much bigger than just some sort of a religious situation uh it's it's it's cronyism of some sort\nThat actually creates monopoly positions for the companies who make products with other means other than kind of it's kind of us can produce everything that oil producers including ... easily can produce enough ... diesel here in Georgia the fuel the entire planet evil engines\nHad met with his libertarian candidate for governor of Georgia taxes and a little bit of a tax reduction in the last\nYou know we didn't we had a huge tax increase and all of his boss he's lost a transportation bill okay a shell game they shuffle the deck chairs net net net we're we're taxed even more even even if we did get a small eliminate the state income tax why not\nOther states surrounding us have no standing won't make Florida of one of your\nOpponent Stacey Abrams who of according to recent news reports was in favor of raising taxes create more revenue for more programs now she said well maybe not maybe not walking that back what do you make of that is that I'm\nJust chime in on that\nUm this the same old political rhetoric tell one group one thing because it the pieces them telling other group and other things is that a piece of them\nSo you know the rhetoric is the governor has no legislative authority he's not the one that passes the bills are he's just the one that science to build you up and want to create them so all the all of my opponents who we're talking about legislative fixes are are talking pie in the sky because they're not the ones that are writing bills\nHow do we pay the bills if we lower the income tax to to nothing or nearly nothing at all what what\nWhat am I to me that ... that that's really the we we create a new new source of taxation in medical\nAnd recreational cannabis [laughter] and and all of the industries that kind of us can bring from plastics feisty and plastic as biodegradable which means doesn't Philip Lance have we done the math or to make sure that that would close the gap oh my God yeah OK billions and billions and\nDo we have five and then ... says to the state constitution or on the ballot this November you're concerned about these you think we should vote no on all of them\nAbsolutely voting on levels elected our little them expand the power of the government to invade and encroach on our constitutionally the NewME rated ... road right\nLet's start with business courts they want to point they or they are not elect a new\nSeparate classes citizens known as businesses\nAnd every time they create a new class of citizens they taste rights away from everyone else\nEssentially what the business court system is going to be it's going to be a parallel court system new judges new offices new facilities and why so they can prosecute more more businesses for not having a license or something like that but the bottom line on it is all of the judges are going to be appointed by the governor there not elected they're appointed\nWhich means they search for life in which means that if the governor has a problem with a particular type of business he can forces judges do\nNot follow the law but follow some sort of a policy\nThe amendment one for the outdoor recreation equipment sale set a ridiculous\nBecause it says that the recreation is it creates um if you're a\nSporting goods store ... part of your taxes from from sales taxes are going to go to outdoor projects which I think is fine but the thing is not defined in the in the legislation is what does the sporting goods store as Wal Mart sells sporting goods target cells sporting goods you know the age of hidden tax here\nWell it could be it could turn out to be just a windfall for a couple of groups who\nOtherwise to collect donations from private organizations who actually use the land we need user fees instead of taxation\nForest land timber conservation that's amendment three and boy I tell you a conservation land is a huge tax scam um we we have our county government are in many cases throughout the state of Georgia giving fifty percent discounts on the tax you have big rich developers donating you unusable land development rates to\nA conservation trust side I'm In the tied up in litigation personally with one that's doing that and it it harms my family and then he called\nIt's called the scam how they grant a special privilege anytime they passed a law that favors the group or a person is called a grant a special privilege it's both federally constitutionally prohibited as well as prohibited mistaken I was just\n\n\n\n\nKim ...\nHui says Hoover lover\nRadio led you\nRode the gloves years loves the good lord only extraordinary [noise]\nWe'll put together

when you look at the side it looks like it's still full right and then you open up there's only three pots ethical you do it like you know when you don't want to be defined in front of the show so look for you know but it's completely\nSo yeah they're going to get coffee some point during the break [noise]\nHa go get coffee gas station and get me a large next bad coffee and I'm a wide rather

hungry have fought\n\nWill hire a bunny and welcome in a bb T field here in Winston Salem North Carolina where today are more rank Clemson Tigers\nThey changed their sex went out of the year they come into perfect dive into two in the Atlantic coast conference play against a demon deep squad that three into all in one an ACC action Clemson in search of their best winning in a row here in Winston Salem and their ten\nOverall against wake forest's done months in Rodney Williams Reggie Mary weather along with each him re will be with us here a little bit later on in the broadcast but guys as we settle into this one here I\nNow have way more of the season stairs is right in the face Rodney sure would be nice to be six to know when all is said and done here today\nYeah there's no question I mean that you're coming into the year yes coach any of the coaches and the players ... what's your goal was right yeah there's no question as to go is it you're still in contention or the bigger goal here and go you're you're selling the conference championship raise you're still in the division rice\nAll your goals are still ahead of you and yet it doesn't feel that way does it it kind of feels like oh well you know we've we've been through a lot we've been through a lot this this year and and the team as kind of there's been some ups and downs last week it was a struggle Syracuse spider unbelievable game we had like a\nAnd M. play an unbelievable game at ... field early in the year and like coach says we're going to get the best of the best we can awake out whoever we play they're going to play their game and we got to expect that\nNow can we step up and and meet the challenge you know I heard you say earlier that\nAnd maybe sometime this week I Know we talked about it last week great teams find ways to win and that's what the tigers had done this year we didn't look pretty I kind of made a joke somebody early on like all we do is keep winning and keep dropping in the polls I mean I don't understand this but they don't mean anything and the coach will tell you that but but to come out of here six knows exactly where the tigers won or bake\nWind red certainly coming off of the win last week and the way that it all happened at that valley and they're coming from behind when over Syracuse you would think you've got to be able to carry that moment of here today to Winston Salem\nYeah just a very emotional start to the season and everything with Kenny Broad does he do full of his past week so\nA lot of motion and his team and like I said that was set the standards high for this team and said hey guys we've got everything still in front of us\nYou know despite all the stuff that have happened we are we going to put one foot in front of the other way to climb and pertain to win and I think it's been a good job this week by keeping these guys focus focusing on the goals so hey wait for a good team come up front\nOf us were going up there with a hostile environment just need to put one foot in front of the other one just go out and windows ...\nWell it certainly our thoughts and prayers are with the family of oh CJ ... obviously just to sum of their shook all of us are inside of the clubs and family with with the kids passing\nThe Rodney you know sometimes you you you got to take things like that that was again things to play for I ate something tells me a running back group particularly here today\nIs going to remember that and they can remember CJ particularly Adam choice I can tell you Adam choice was the guy that was really close\nTo the CJ full of stuff that tells you the running back we're going to play pretty well here today\nThat in ... you know [noise] it's just amazing how much time you spend with these guys when you're in college and\nToday's athlete it's a it's a fulltime job you end up spending more time with with your teammates especially your physician guys in that room and you do with your family is just amazing how they become your family and so I definitely will say that you expect to see that today and and I said it's like\nLast week we had a Kelly Bryant thing we've we've had a lot\nOf lot of controversy I say controversial a lot of\nDistractions this team and and this week and like everything was going to be smooth and then we had the uh the tragic news of losing CJ and now they've got to deal with that but\nDefinitely think this team each one of these events is galvanizing this team and and making them ... and you listen to the coaching staff they don't want to peek today they want to peek in about six weeks that they want to get better today than they were last week but they don't want to be playing their best foot ball and the first of October\nI Wish that both of you could have been in the the team meeting her that I even non believable the way they coach Sweeney handle the\nHandle the passing of CJ pull or with a with a team I mean it was just unbelievable [noise] Reggie though you and I obviously we we visit after ... for every game but now that you've had time to maybe think about it and so given what happened at Syracuse\nFrom on running back I\nMean ... you had to love what you saw last week they went to school they just absolutely impose their will on Syracuse and the second half\nI'll tell you what we talk a lot of the radio about uh the the touches then and then when I was I Am I got to see the faces of choice of eastern Aegean together on the sideline\nAnd it was just like what are we doing you know what I mean so watching those guys last week go in and contribute to this when it means so much that only to the running back group the Tony ... went to this team and these guys into football but hey look at what we do we give these guys twenty plus years this is what happens when the uh\nThe the also the line [noise] comes together started laying on people hey we can when football so again you know a freshman quarterback\nLast week hey this is what we need to do it one of all effectively to be able to back those lie backers into a box and open up a passing lanes but there's quarterback so I looked for us this year I mean this this game to open up a
