travel and tourism\nCan cast Mitt is an avid murder who's written thousands of books including his own field guide series the counseling field guides and he led many bird tourists to all seven continents he's also a frequent keynote speaker at many bird in nature events and he's joining us now\nFrom what I can I'm told your frequent listener reverse shows so thank you and welcome to our world travel\nBoth thanks so much uh yeah I'm very interested in travel and or you guys are the experts on the authorities I Love your show\nWill appreciate that very much so let's we've never done a segment on this program dating back to its inception in two thousand four I'm burning kind of surprised me and it's the reason why we asked our producer Valerie to coordinate your parents so from your experiences and travels how big do you think the burning industry is and\nWhy does it continue the growing popularity\nOf huge actually I mean there have been surveys and studies trying to quantify it all the way there are more than forty five million people in the United states your bird watchers across a lot of them do that in the back yard but there's also or do you travel element to it\nAnd putting groceries and three thousand malevolent or almost Fifteen billion dollars were spent by bird watchers during their travel for lodging and transportation\nI think that's pretty big that's here said I said can for people listening I think you know there may be the sort of misnomer that you need to travel to exotic parts of the world to enjoy hurting but there are three areas right here in the U.S that are outstanding destinations and I know that you've written about nano that you've been to\nA central New Mexico the central Texas coast north eastern Florida which I'm not sure how the fact that they weren't with the hurricane that might be a little bit more challenging next week but can you just give us a quick factor two of those three areas\nI'm sure yeah that's especially relevant right now there are a lot of thinking about a National Wildlife refuges and National Wildlife refuge week\nStarts tomorrow and October ... runs a part in the ... but anyway I Am from Iraq or go to the book at the national wildlife refuge is an amazing area for wintering bird like I Do ...\nAnd ... and if your favorite ... it's\nJust amazing and look up there the central Texas coast around the national wildlife refuge is the best place in the world of cooking and the weather there there was a big clock but the northern Canada migrate south central\nAnd the whole area that are posted by her arm in August ... thousand seven and they're still rebuilding ... some of the area were rough but if you go there the bird watching with great them by going there during the winter you're a ... or economy and help rebuild\nAnd then uh over in northeastern Florida a lot of my favorites Bob the merit island National Wildlife refuge and one thing about that is a great shape your visiting like Disney World or some other tourist attractions around la land Amway and we want to get away from watching Merritt Island is very close\nTo something to do there I saw was the last year I went to moslem Mexico for the show and I'm a plane with me were a group of birders heading offer their annual trip and that gave me a real idea on how big this industry is about five years ago I was staying at a hotel in South central Iceland hotel ranking hello Iceland and\nJacob gene and Nick and to New Jersey who a as a CVA designation Rodney that's right and what does that mean\nA certified valuation ... you need your business value to call a self we can do that for you but you're going to sell it if you needed for state reasons yeah yeah\nAnd now we have a guest on today a none other than buster breathing muster a is a intern in our research farm and then yes of course today is an all research show uh we'll get down to a ... end of the the\nWe're going to delve into the what's going on in the economy what's going on in the financial markets um so why not just go ahead and start off what happened to the market the first of\nAll your warm welcome just really gets me in the mood to talk about the economy fan yeah like that I can only be a one off but none just stuck around I like you know is like I don't\nI don't do any Randy were brand new Britain millennials now I like ... or some of us are millennials and were branding to millennials actually some of us as in not me\n[laughter] All right the rest of us know but but there's been a lot going on this week uh if you looked at the headlines or if you looked at the market watching news you'll see\nThe market was down ... never getting me on Wednesday it's carried over into Thursday um come back somewhat late in the day now we're down and you know at the time recording this one and a half ... five hundred um\nFor the week the last five days almost six percent we've lost and the\nYeah I was raised in the end of ... you look at the worst performing sector really not a big price and the high flier all year but taxes down ... percent yeah right right\nThat's a pretty ugly in mind that looks has looked overvalued for some time now in as a result of the hardest if you felt like you had been left behind on your utilities bet earlier in the ...\nWe could your week yeah forty three basic points the only sector that has higher period yeah so ah not too bad you still look at the consumer discretionary for the twelve month period a Seventeen point five six percent yes and the five hundred up almost nine percent\nUm information technology Seventeen percent as one year to date though a lot of those gains that we've been seeing a\nHas been a race were still up three point seven percent you're today um but we're over what ten percent\nOh yeah when we were yeah we were well over just last week a still look as though so forgive the leader there you've got healthcare ten three four yes\nThere I was I was thinking about that just today I saw the headline come across healthcare leaning on the air and if you just fat\nAre are re one I mean uh maybe year year and a half of feel like the story the narrative around was something's going to be done about these drug prices it\nReally wasn't and that was a that was kind of a Trump thing to a lot of folks given credit for a deregulating a financial saying no you know you can't really fault that fault and there he did a gave us a new tax reforms but he was talking a lot about bringing the price of drugs down\nYeah no that was a big concern for us is obviously holds drug companies journey for for further investment I Know personally you guys runners concern is I was but that was a real concern for me are are you going to see those drug makers pullback significant land obviously healthcare as a whole done quite well biotech a thing and farm ... as well as army well\nBeen leading the way it's just interesting to see how these things like that play out how what's the\nNext winter time you heard when's the last minute I have about drug prices kind of layer by writing by right into the panic yeah so I said well if you did that\nUh in the past week we did get a numbers on employment situation a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs created in September\nI was shy of what was expected I Believe one eighty four when any file with the expectation although you have to consider Hurricane Florence a lot of this is seen as kind of a short term hiccup sure so you would expect in October the number to be better you also had\nA you know on the the good side you had two previous months were asked to revise upwardly yeah\nAnd you had unemployment falling three point seven percent yeah ... I didn't get low right yeah yeah unbelievable but wages ticked off as well what do we see wage growth to point seven Cy person who has I think it was to yeah to put it yeah oh\nYeah we have news this week a on\nA ... a producer price index little inflation news right yeah ... CPI both pulled back yeah they're still positive ah PBR two point six percent the corps when you take out food and energy two point five percent or CPI\nA gave us to point ... three\nPursuing three percent a court to point two percent year over year that's\nThe third month in a row that we've seen a decline in inflation which is good news\nAh yeah\nI mean that's the reason you know a lot of ... it will yeah you're bringing your bringing up what's what you heard a lot and I read a lot today as as the fed going to kind of pump the brakes a little bit now since inflation's\nNot as high as we've seen it\nYet so we have another a decision coming up in December um\nThis I think if we were in this period in the last cycle so we just got a rate increase or end of last month on the twenty sixth of September\nUh we got our third for the year point two five percent increase or an ... at the time they were uh you know if you look at the probabilities according to the options market we were looking at about Seventy seven percent of another increase\nOr just in the last few days I'm ready to move to hire\nA the market really the rates of move pretty uh pretty significantly\nHigher that senator get up to three and a quarter percent yeah right since come back a bit in their teens and\nBy my analysis that was really the catalyst for this activity so off there were ... I think so too are you you look at the CPI print that we got\nA Thursday a to point three it seemed to arrest the decline at least in the morning sure maybe thinking that uh I mean they it brought the ten year back back off another five or six bits back down to like three one seven inch maybe thinking the fed and my\nMy there among the brace a little bit here I don't know with inflation you know under shooting the expectation that two four\nYeah it's still a little above target their targets two percent and they don't use CPI obviously they use the PC you later but a reality is inflation's coming down which is right what the Fed's job is to keep inflation in check at least part of it and keep employment Hi\nWe got unemployment falls or inflation falls as well\nUm you know what what's the bad thing here I think you know if you look at it and ... you talked about being a business value waiter\nUm the uh the analysts would tell you that when the cost of capital rises that the value of the businesses theoretically lower\nRight so ah shouldn't be a huge surprise to most people that we have a sell off that we've seen over the last few days right and I think I think we've all admitted to each other the valuation looks pretty stretched it does I mean it doesn't it it depends on what you look at now uh we could have this debate all day long a peace don't look\nBad as it were back in the tech bubble days right around the late nineties or have you\nHave is our recession a lot of that is from what I've said profit margins are as high ... if not higher than they've ever been right I'm at the same time you have seen more financial engineering this cycle and ... cycles if you look at prices sales or ...\nOr operating or earnings another in other words we're at similar valuations so what we used all over in the tech bubble at least it was a little concerning and it it it it's why I think\nAs rates move higher it is putting pressure on these\nHigh flying names one of those things are as one of the things that I did want to mention is with the oil base affected those kind of makes sense that the guys you have an down sure you go back to the middle the middle of last year\nBut with or the middle of this year we had an\nOil up Seventy five percent over last year now moving into oh we'll fifty percent female overall prices not terribly high relative to previous periods you're right right Laurie rose and the price is right and that's what we're looking at CPI anyways is that you're you're sure there are things that I I I Do feel like the fed is watching\nIt and maybe they don't care about CPI as much as we do\nA but that wage growth number I mean they understand Livermore he's pretty tight you see a to point it wears drug number I'm not sure if I personally\nUh were put my chips on the side of the feds come and pump the brakes anytime soon they're going to steal\nThe one thing I Will say is when you look at that options implied probability I just talked about Seventy seven percent back right before we had the last interest rate hike\nOh today it's ... around Seventy two and a half so it it has the probability hasn't decreased it's still about fifty percent were still saying yeah it's very likely will see a fed interest rate hike\nBut we might be getting back to the point where we can\nBe shocked right you had this fun forever we had the fun headlined a today with Trump's the vows going crazy you\nHi you're talking about the ... one of the\nThing I Want to mention is you know we say this whenever we've had the ten cent climbed the past but you know I think on average market or to climb five percent for like four times a year and and the average here is that right\nOr five percent or two to three\n... three times but we haven't had that since January so ... you know you start to cities\nThe closet has been rat but it has happened quickly but people start to panic but just know that these things are healthy from time to time\nUh the point you made diversification only works if there is lack of correlation among the different segments or read about the different pieces of your assets which means that you don't want to buy some and using the same direction\nAnd the way the way we'd like to talk about diversification if we're not talking sectors is going to be size younger fee in style ... value verse grow larger ... small and international international international versus us so\nBasically ... ... when you set out when you ... you think about you know the amount of risk that you're willing to take obviously you know your your small cap growth is going to be a lot riskier than your large have value under you know Chinese ... more so than us apple is for them what you make your plan\nWe said don't try and time the market but rebalance for portfolio to what the market gives you so if you haven't asked the class is doing well we're a stocking stuffer flows doing well\nGlenn cell that and by some of the losers says it's all your winters lots of losers get back to your targets\nAnd and not even just within within stocks think outside of stocks they get other asset classes and they fit your investments dial your risk tolerance Sean lawn a commodity those that are\nNot quite as risky you would rather probably have something that the price doesn't move around a bunch bonds or the way to go\nRight yeah exactly so you know Jacob wanted a presentation to some students earlier and if you look at\nIt long term returns and you know small cat and they kept large cap equities I think as pilots called twelve eleven and ten percent return is respectively and so you know you you make the argument oh well over the long term but and I put everything in small cap stocks will then if you look from ten nine eight seven to three and on and on top of the market to the bottom of the market during the\nGreat recession financial crisis there's you have\nThere were two hours just crushing yeah they're down ... like\nCat was down fifty five fifty eight percent something there too I think it was like yeah if the\nTwo and fifty five for the small men and long term treasuries were all there was a strong inverse correlate it it's intuitive I mean everyone's worried everyone's panicking you're going to sell your risky assets and buying something you don't worry about some ... you know worry about so it's going to go up in price\nBy so uh that's a big thing I guess one more point to make is when you think about it from starters from a from a beginning investors point of view or if you are just looking at the allocation peace not trying to get in there and pick stocks you don't have to spend as much time either you know it's a very important part of investing and putting together your portfolio\nBut ah the reality is it's a\nA it will take a lesson for your time in a you know most people unless you're just to finance speak like us or you're not gonna you're not going to have that much time to send me and you got a life to live right yeah and\nAnd the one thing we haven't mentioned that we always stress is at the beginning investor every company ... offers a four O. one K. with a match at least at least put as much as a match and their cause that's free money\nIt truly is yeah you've you've just double your money they're matching you especially dollar for dollar All right

R. again so uh guys uh there's there's a good question here and especially on the news or the markets this week David from Woodstock\nA emailed us and said so despite all the economic data there's been coming out of the that's been positive there has been a lot of that um\n[noise] I see a this undertone of negative expectations for nearly every pundit fund manager in t._v. talking head\nI get the feeling that finance industry people are worried about the market turning quickly or should the average investor be expecting harsh knows that well I mean to say no after this week would be kind of a short sided but\nI I think what happens is when everything is perfect uh you know it's kind of like there's a commercial on right now the ladies sitting on a couch she says it's quiet\nListen to that and then she says oh wait a minute it's too quiet\nThat kind of what the financial world seems to be doing at the moment and uh you know if things do seem really well we've got the as we've already mentioned unemployment very low uh we've got no wages rising faster than inflation people are feeling wealthier so the consumer is doing great\nFeeling great um companies are grown earnings they are we've seen twenty five plus percent earnings growth in the last couple of quarters\nTax reform tax reform your taxes has been lowered a you know we can go on and on about this business activity on occasion that blow out right so more confidence so really ... the problem with us I think is\nAnd us I'm saying financial analysts in general and not just the you know those that work at his word financial ah the the problem is when you're the king of the hill there's only one direction\nAnd and that's what it feels somewhat like were playing so you know over the past few months really since January we've been keenly\nAre watching not you Jake obtain a I'm saying keenly as in as in ...\nTo to use to find out what you're paying fees and what's your load might be but it let's say you're looking at ... versus ... shares insurance might have a lower fee or higher fee with no low T shirt might have a lower the\nUh but no load or I'm Sorry but with all its aren't yet right so you what do you watch list of things the expense ratio and is there a load associated\nWith mental illness are a lot often a lot different quite often liar so uh you know you might have a really low expense ratio for the same portfolio a but in reality you got to invest a million dollars and you know as we were talking mutual funds really aren't for the uh the perfect place for those with a\nA lot of money to go but if it's a smaller amount and get you a portfolio really quickly right All right so you can you can dig around a little bit uh as Nick said on the Internet and get a get a good a fix for what is a different about the different share classes so are\nThere you go dean uh got another question here Steve for inviting says ah wanted to get your opinions on ...\nUh no it has a high price to earnings ratio but I feel everything is so high right now and maybe not in the last week or so we got to a buying opportunity potentially um maybe we can talk about that in a minute to uh I like their momentum and uh see analysts still consider it a very strong by so um\nYou know Steve we got a I Would agree with you to some degree I'm probably the most attractive\nThing about the stock is the fact that revenue is growing at thirty nine percent\nThat's pretty awesome I'm getting a expected long term growth a which is three to five years usually is what we figure here a twenty four point four percent growth and earnings as expected a stock like that is probably gonna ... you are a\nPretty big PE ratio in India it's huge they're eight point\nSix really high and and a problem I have with it as something that the jak when I talk about a lot of economic mode right you have grown up there especially food delivery service so they are\nWants to keep anybody\nPrescribing into the space and it varies a barriers to ensure a fairly low and it's pretty competitive space you've got ... you've got ... you've got over eats post mates that's four I can name yeah there's probably a started right now yeah a ... and other while there's plenty of\nUh yeah I'm kind of I'm kind of at odds with that take\nBecause I Do think if you look back to the sort of platform type businesses the Amazon and Netflix is of the world I mean they didn't really have a ... when they first started either but they did have a first mover advantage\nAnd I think ... and started in Nineteen Ninety nine it does have a ... a bit of a first mover adventure and their relationship to the Yelp is definitely worse than the fact they acquired yolks\nEight twenty four business which was their delivery business ... there is a revenue sharing going on there um in and helps\nFound some success you know in in that space so I don't know how you guys feel about you but I I feel like it's kind of the go to if I'm looking for\nA restaurant so they already had the ... and maybe and looking for I don't know what it wants to eat him looking for a restaurant a but I don't really feel I drive and you know it's kind of an average others but still at the other day at\nWhat is eighty five times earnings is kind of price to perfection or they're going to have to execute was a really difficult market there and it's probably one of the most discretionary\nItems that consumer can buy right you're not order and take out for ... like twenty bucks a meal I mean there's been a twenty bucks mill you're feeling pretty good about your financial condition for sure I\nYeah when you can eat a fast food place for well under ten bucks you learn to ride or\nI don't know I've got good things to say about it but I I don't think the ... I don't see the price of makes sense yeah there was a couple of things that I Would mention in and it's kind of your point Jacob ... you know there there's going to be some consolidation near the weak players are going to get either ... or they're going to get\nGet pushed into bankruptcy or just pushed out of the marketplace grow above a currently own seamless\nAnd not only that a yum brands bought two hundred million stake in the company in February of this year so that to me uh when one of the food uh specially yum brands Taco Bell right and the\nAnd a Pizza Hut is is a is it so you know you've got a you've got those three brands that have already got no weighed in saying more or less you know they don't have a stake in anything else\nAny of the other providers plus you said you know Yelp and they've they've partnered with ... so uh if anybody is is the head of the curve I Would say it has to be growing up if you really want to be in the middle of that space\nThat's the one to do I would I Would be a struggle for me to hold my nose and go past that\n...
