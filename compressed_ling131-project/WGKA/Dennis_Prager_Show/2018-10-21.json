on\nThat one of the things that I Love that you write about in your article was that yes libraries of course are all about the book and the book collections but you also reference some secrets in the actual buildings down will take away the one that you describe I think it was the ... the library of St Paul is that where is that Switzerland\nAnd put it in a really cool down and go in and about an

not a mommy and in the middle of the law gridlock wonderful 'cause that was a baby killer\nAnd for us it was really hot like who doesn't like to agree with a lot of course I'm a shake or we have to go to the old law\nWell I mean yeah I I Love when you just said you know how you all came about this together and how to negotiate as any other looming very diplomatic ... we took our sons to the library

I'm given great advice and helping folks\nAh allocate their four one K. um\nSo in the hopes of retiring well mhm yeah that's the plan exactly so uh guys we got the S. and P. five hundred over the last five days is actually up felt very volatile now that as of the recording on Thursday we know what the market is a\nAs um sold off a bit lately and part of it did come on Thursday when are\nWe heard from the federal open market committee which is a part of the Federal Reserve or the folks that set the overnight lending rate and er basically what they had to say was they expect to continue raising interest rates yeah\nI'm In an effort to control inflation right yeah uh here's here's my take on that and and you're absolutely right here I mean that's why they do it the feds got\nKind of dual mandate or used to be that only paid attention to as inflation making sure that inflation didn't get out of control they wanted to be positive eighties wanted to be slightly positive rather have a target of two percent and um right now inflation is a to point three percent\nThat down from the previous month where it was to point seven percent\nAnd that previous Martha's down from the even more previous month two point nine percent so inflation seems like it's being taint ... uh there's a lot of folks including our president who have come out and said uh\nUh he got it might be good yeah it might be a good time to to\nUh think about taking a breath instead of staying on your um your bandwagon to lower or higher interest rates low inflation I'm at the risk we run is that ah we invert the yield curve and stifle\nNot only inflation but economic growth run 'em you know over the last few months we've seen a\nA GDP Growth rates four point one percent and the last two quarters a pretty significant much of that and I've talked about it before and the show a I Believe is due to um\nTax reform ah you know we had twenty five percent earnings growth and that's measured year over year so and the second quarter was relative to the second quarter of two thousand Seventeen third quarter the same thing it's relative to two thousand seventeenth third quarter I'm and we're expected in the third quarter to do\nA ... yeah and we're expecting the third quarter to see our first and second or third quarter is expected to be twenty five percent grows again so I'm you know we've got good growth uh we've got inflation paring back um\nYou see the volatility have has crept in because\nOf the Fed's discussion\nInterest remark it certainly doesn't look ... been getting a lot of questions from claws past week about the not tell them\nDo what you just said you know there's still a lot of help coming out of\nThe economy and the markets in general and so the the same information that we had when we made the buying decisions to invest in the companies that we did is largely what is still the case today so just because interest rates are beginning to creep up which again the the the food is doing in that effort to control inflation was\nProbably a maybe a small amount of regard but not much to what the market thinks about it right because I guarantee the market will like the inflation numbers all is a lot more actually is a they were can continue just to keep race where they were so\nMy point is there's still a lot of good things coming out of the market and and the fact that interest rates are going up does that make mortgages more expensive and potentially\nYou know prevent people from getting into a whole new world yeah maybe but there's also this other side of the things we're you know what money market uh interest rates are coming back of your short or a little bit more on your money that you know has not been available for years you know low interest rates were so great\nBenefit to savers there it's not all bad\nYeah I think that's probably the biggest part when we've almost lost a whole generation of retirees when they were used to much higher rates were Twenty years ago and very true yeah we're\nHappy just to get three or four and now we can start to get some high returns on that amount of historical perspective absolutely just and that's a that's exactly what we're we're looking at right now so\nI'm you know it's a\nA not a horrible thing as you said a dirt the or the the problem is we got an increase in the costs of capital because we have a rise in a in the interest rates um the other thing is\nUm we don't know when the rates might slow down and there's something else going on we really don't talk about much don't hear much in the media at all and that's a quantitative tightening\nHave you guys heard anything about quantitative tiny so we had ...\nDecades building is easing yeah we had qualitative easing for a long time well ... in doing that we had the the feds balance she'd get up to four points four trillion dollars in two thousand eight when we started this program\nI'm In the ... and she was about five hundred billion\nRuns so uh last October or the fed came out and said hey look here's what we're gonna do guys we're going to try to retool so we've got something to do it if and when I was you know the business cycle is definitely not dead ... uh it's it's been elongated for sure\nOver our last cycle you know having a having bottom that a\nA march of two thousand nine\nUh we've been in this this uh positive upswing in the economy let alone the stock market for for ... you know what do we got nine years now the the longest bull market in history as of about a month ago\nUm so when you've got a the feds balance sheet where we had bought so many treasuries\nAnd a mortgage backed securities\nThat bloated the way it was ... we would be crazy to try to do any quantitative easing if we had another major issue where we needed the interest rate cut that\nAh couldn't be done with just the overnight lending rate which is Canada the building block of the rest of interest rates in the in the market so um\n[noise] what we had as it started out at ten billion dollars they're allowing these uh treasuries and and mortgage backed securities to mature overtime or and it's been a monthly thing they have it does stepped out well it caps at fifty billion dollars yes when it kept\nThis month so a year and we're now letting fifty billion dollars worth of treasury roll off\nWithout treasuries mortgage backed securities probably more mortgage backs but you know it was relatively close mix\n'em but ah we're letting them roll off just mature which another ... ... an absolutely that is quantitative tightening when you have a big bar or like the United states government in the market purchasing bonds what happens the price goes up and we know the bonds have\nAn inverse relationship between their yield and their price [laughter] so uh in in looking at that we've got two things working the only one we are talking about is the ... the\nUh the actual rate setting body but in reality uh we got quantitative type thing going on behind the scenes as part of the reason that we're seeing longer term interest rates increase um\nBut I look at whether or not you understand the concept of quantitative easing or tightening up at the bottom line is that that's the responsibility of the federal open market yeah the ... and they do that to control inflation I think it's still a more positive thing to be where we are now than what we were discussing the last time ozone with Detroit and that is\nThe track record of what happens in this country when the yield curve doesn't work and if they don't make some of these decisions like they're making with regard to history storage we could very well see that and that's that was one hundred percent of the time when the yield curve and version happens\nOr a recession and ... know shortly thereafter within what two main source of Austria probably on the long run yeah look I mean you might not you might not like the rates for whatever your reason would be but at the end of the day they're doing it in an effort to control inflation\nWhich affects the yield curve and we knew that equates to so this is important stuff that they need to be doing and while the market may not like it just know that it's it's appropriate for where we are\nNo taxes yeah if you do the math precisely actually it's it's all about the tax write so if you assume that you're paying more tax now than you will in retirement\nThen you're better off to forgo the taxes today I'm saving ... front and and you know you'll get the money at\nIt there in your retirement or whenever you start drawing shot at a lower tax rate but it truly is just about the tax rate if you just do the the role math\nAnd so um there's nobody that can tell the future of course um we always assume the taxes are too high now and they might get worse but hey in the fifties and sixties taxes war ... well I just saw what's happened here with our current administration acts as of now gone down so we don't know where they're\nGoing to go but I think at the end of the day I think you know a company's match is always going to come pre tax and so you know you're going to be getting pre tax money you know it's always smart to have some type of rock contribution within the ... that way you get both have both of those buckets like we like to go right for different coasts are so\nMany people don't realize that you know if you if you have the option to put fifty percent of your contribution to your four one K. and the traditional portion and the other fifty and you're all portion and then you know in the case of of Matthew and marry him you know if they're if they're getting this five percent match\nThat entire five percent of the employers giving them goes to the traditional portion of the match does not get a plot or allocated to the raw portion at all which no huge deal but I think the bottom line here is\nYou need a balance between the tax diversification of ... just as much as you might need diversification and your investments ... it'll give you some control in retirement that while that might not matter as much to you now I can assure you that once you reach that age and and you are basically being forced into a certain tax situation here\nThat is going to be a lot more meaningful to you at that time so for sure well what\nIf we take it one step further should should you also saving a brokerage account or a taxable account [noise] I think\nYou should I I think it's important 'cause right now we're talking about really the three main types of money ride you got the tax exempt money which is wrong with the tax deferred money which is for one k.'s and traditional are raising cetera but then you got the the after tax money which is just a brokerage and in the case of of that and you only pay tax on the games you make with the investments within it and\nAnd and then only when you realize themselves right gains until you sell that you really don't have to pay the tax\nExactly but I I think it's good to to have as much option as you can and while you might forego some of that tax benefit in the in the near term as you were saying if you still have you know especially for younger folks look like you mentioned justice there that you've got plenty of time to make back\nThe the the taxes that you were for going by by having the money tax and then putting it into a ... for instance and letting that money grow tax exempt because it's not there's no tax application on it if you hold it until retirement me on fifty nine and a half either so\nYou know what you got plenty of time to to hit that break even on what it would otherwise be if you didn't for those attacks and just put it into an attached to for money to\nI'm just finding was clause does not something I read it in a book or anything like that is just the atmosphere and we work with now right exactly they are expressing some regret for not having a little bit of option and and flexibility now that they've reached that retirement age and\nAnd it's a tool to taxable account as a tool that you can use to offset some of the other ... you have if you have losses within that account or you can you can go ahead and in a sell some of those uh realize those losses and lower your ... your tax burden in any given year Russia [noise] All right well let's take a real

E. N. S. S. L. E. R. so guys I'm as I was saying when we last spoke we were talking about a four O. one case a couple of who's saved um\nAt least what we consider the minimum where you're getting the match from your company five percent sure um but they've saved it all to traditional so it was a pre tax\nUh our advice is kind of spread it around not only use the the pre tax but if there is a Roth option or be a good idea for you to save some money to the rough gives you a a diversification in the vehicle through which you save for retirement as well as a brokerage account which gives you the added\nBenefit while the the money goes in after tax so you're going to get the taxi it from your income\nOr you put the money into a brokerage account\nOr but it also that then allows you to come to manage your tax situation or in retirement which if you've only saved to a regular four one K. you don't have that option ...\nWell and and look here's why this is extremely important enough seeing this a couple of times lately which once again I Would never thought of\nBeforehand but you know if if you go into retirement and all you have to ask for money that's you know let's just say one four one K. account but you say to all your life\nAnd then you come across let's say a piece of property or a boat or just some big purchase that you want to make it look so you're you're against you know financing that purchase or at least would prefer not to to finance that well if you want to pay cash for it let's just say something that cost fifty thousand dollars\nThat a client won't do this for a small cabin up in the mountains recently\nBut everything you know the money that he was going to need to to take out of his accounts to pay for it was all in the tax deferred account he's got a twenty percent of federal withholding on that money so the fifty thousand in order to buy the property he had to take out sixty thousand to cover that twenty percent withholding right now it's effectively cost you more recalls\n... years ago I bet you that would be people who disagreed with you without a doubt wanting to G A\nI was just that one had another proud of Tampa yeah yep yeah things change people change management dangers I mean there there are reasons that you cannot assume that you're going to hold anything forever but let me flesh out a little bit of what's going on here next their energy symbol in E.\nAh it's got a five year earnings growth uh almost twelve percent\nExpected to grow by about eight and a half percent going forward\nUm the company is a a a utility it's an interesting take on the utility it's a they generate electricity through when solar nuclear and natural fire fired gas facility so uh they've got some renewable energy and then they've got\nUm you know nuclear and and um gas fired um\nGenerators or the company really does seem pretty solid return on equity and eleven percent uh it's got us reasonable devotee into point seven percent you well covered one point seven times uh you know not to not growing like a tech stock these days but\nUh still a pretty solid auction does meet our investment criteria based on financial strengthen safety I'm not a bad option a McCormick in company a got expecting growth eight point eight percent so a little bit better the next era\nUh although it's a expectations actually match its history where next theirs is a little lower than what it's been recently I'm\nTwenty three percent return on equity a little more substantial now this company McCormick if you've ever been down to spy style at the grocery store you know who we're talking about oh yeah ... are so good stuff tends to be a staple you're going to buy a spices problem I Can't imagine that you're going to\nLay off the stage just because it's a recession his foes actually you're going to eat what they eat you know no matter what so a energy and staples both probably pretty solid options for for a downturn does make them a little more\nAre likely to be those companies that you could potentially hold for long periods of time\nUh they're they're both very profitable both uh meet our investment criteria the yield is one point six four percent all McCormick so it's a bit of a lower a dividend it's better covered because they're not paying out as much of their\nEarnings to point three times\nA yield coverage a living coverage so\nI'm either one of these are pretty pretty decent options I don't really recommend them at the moment I'm you know just because it's there there are other options in the market that I Would prefer but ah I I tend to agree with you Jared I Would be really\nPressed to call something a buying hold for an ethics mhm hopefully the joke that the broker made was just that I'm a joke [laughter] um\nBut as a result we have you guys here and and the research department I mean we really you don't even want to buy and hold you want to buy and and do your homework like a a pretty popular guy on CNBC always says right I mean you don't you don't just buying and forget about it you got to keep an eye on it that analysis as to continue to make sure that as things change it is to\nHold her as long as it makes sense yeah there is surely know by and forget right exact out\nAll right so ah got a few more questions here uh one of those when I was trying to jump the gun on a Albert from Gainesville my four one K. offers in plan Ross conversions is something I should consider I'm fifty and I've been in my company for about twelve years\nPretty a pretty good ten year for a burden employee must be a decent company if you stuck around for twelve years later a suggestion what do you think on this one\nBut you know the plan may or may not offer and plan Roskam perversion feature some players do some plans don't just like they might not offered the Roth auction or ... or or anything like that every plans designed a little bit different shows so I think that's the first thing to think about but the second thing is by\nDoing a Roth conversion you are going to throw yourself into a different tax bracket so I think it makes sense to talk to your CPA before you make any type of decision like that if you are going to ... so really if the plant has a raw feature\nMy advice would be utilized that Ross the start saving Raul as opposed to taking all this other money that you say pre tax and then oh by the way paying taxes and all of it\nNow you did mention earlier that quite often the matches on the pre tax portion correct that sort of up and it gets are right and so you would say still ... to to stick around with the ... up to the match anything you said earlier over and above\nA will probably go to the wrong if you're trying to build a position in ... and and the allegation should be about saying I Would say\nShe you know if the if the allegation and your traditional RA fit you then you should probably go with the same uh allocation just to kind of augment what you're already\nIt's important to look at everything you know as one you have to look at your IRA four one K. your brokerage account they're not all separate they are all part of your financial picture exactly so it's important to talk to advisor like Jared to make sure everything is in line\nFor hours case you know at the end of the day that this would be taxable event so if there was a conversion that took place\nYou you do need to talk with the attacks account maybe and see what the implications for you would be independent on that answer I mean I agree I think either\nDid did you do it because it makes sense for your situation based on the amount that you you're thinking about converting or you say you know I'm not going to convert I'm just go start saving a portion of what I was otherwise saving to the tax deferred part then start putting that into the ...\n... and that may be especially\nYou know in our case of fifty years old is he converted I think he's got plenty of time to make back what is going to go and tax and then you know the result is he's going to be in a place where you know if he's fifty eight when that happens everything it makes me on that age is now in a tax exempt account and what he pulls from it\nAfter fifty nine and a half there's no there's no you have to worry about much so\nWell and that's the other thing about the raw I don't know if we can only earlier once you hit Seventy and a half in her off you know you do not have to take those required minimum distribution right where the traditional you do you have to go you're giving yourself flexibility on not just taxes but hey when I have to actually pull money because we don't have to pull it you can leave it in\nThat's right and the reason the government tells you that way is because they've given you in their minds a gift you got a you've got to save their tax revenue time yeah at some point but the the game is going to be up and they want their tax money as a matter of ah it's why they go and there's been talk\nOf actually pushing the Seventy and a half back to a hundred years later okay ... went to the Trump Administration we heard some people talk about Seventy three Seventy four which would be good\nAt some point or another they will get the Monday when they're getting addressed that have been a fisheries I mean there's going to store still because they'll have mandatory

yeah All right uh Jerry this looks like one for you Bob from Decatur rights I'm starting to shop around for a long term care insurance is there anything I should avoid\n[noise] well I Would recommend that you avoid the traditional long term care policies unless you know that there are some specific circumstances where those much still be a desirable but you know in large part to harbor products that they they\nAre are offering now that these insurance companies which threw a hybrid products you know if you don't use the benefit that you're buying through a or have a long term care need it could still potentially pay out in the form of a death benefit\nOr to whoever you know what every bit of fish that you have on that account that way you know with traditional long term care it's kinda like auto insurance if you don't use it you lose it and a lot of people are more hesitant to do that and so I Would consider you know looking at these Harvard products and what's available there\nAre over the traditional long term care unless I'm you know your your circumstances warm so then that's something that would Woodward further conversation but\nIn terms of just long term care insurance in general I Would prefer to have a harbor products so that I Know at least if I don't need it or come down with a long term care of it it'll get use to through the the death benefit to my beneficial\nSets a whole lot better than that last question where somebody asked you want to avoid and you said wouldn't Nichols no that's right that's\nRight I mean do chained up county mark it up

Claire McCaskill sheriff responded to our hidden camera investigation she attacked a video of course she made a false statement in this state that she put out a she said that the Republican candidate for Senator John Ali\nHad brought you don't really imbedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct I had nothing to do with Josh ... never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved in this investigation and just to your listeners know our investigation Claire McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that her and all the cat's gonna bottles policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that uh other staffers talking about banning semi automatic rifles and McCaskill herself was caught on camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that they would be a gun than the sum type so the capital now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she definitely on defense if you look at the uh\nResponse that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only does the staff or talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they talk about and guns\nClara herself talks about um when she gets into this than actual vote with so called Chuck

and that's what all staffers are saying he's saying the moderate we'll just have to get over being allied very devastating very powerful\nI mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we had

she didn't live on local TV in Missouri Larry that what's gonna happen next to this other Senate candidate John always say that he had nothing\nTo do with it chicken that respond to that so I think

seats\nFrom Democrats in Minnesota and that the Democrats are pulling out of a couple of states that look it'd be treading in our direction so again we got to run through the tape this is you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't take anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down\nThe candidate quality and sort of the twenty to thirty states that we are talking about here\nAren't don't let me talk to you about some defense so she was first of all the F twenty twos at ten dull a it's a murky picture or I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt bad bad but maybe we did get hurt that bad maybe a things to stealth technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment wide by the way do we keep twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell and trying to read through that and I'm looking forward to being back in session in November So we can ask the hard questions of the aid figure out what exactly happened\nIt seems like Seventeen twenty Jews or damage\nI think ten of those are cats and the storm rated hangar but no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus miles per hour winds\nAnd seven of the seven of the Seventeen were less to read it hangers I think it's important to note that no one thought this would be a four to five little earth imported

of that twenty two going into super cruise over Kansas it's too disturbing to the local community\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country\nSo as best I can tell him talking to officials pocket experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be repaired but the problem here is the skin on the plane there's a lot of radar absorbent material ram involved\nAnd the repairing and replacing it'd be very expensive and my understanding of the initial site survey suggests that the air frame appear to be okay so we believe we can get most of them back\nOn track to repairing the skin um will be a very expensive proposition finally I just stay out of your question you know why we're so many their ground this goes back\nReally to the Obama administration decision to hold the program a two thousand nine Secretary Gates was the ultimate decided that decision and the decision to cut back on air force personnel and train maintain ers and funds for reading it so we had to answer the reason that the question that so many were on the ground and the first place\nWith their engines pulled it because of the lack of

they've shared that wish there U.S intelligence ... who often work very closely with the Turks and then that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree\nOf seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on us to try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nRight now and does it impact for example the war in Yemen this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses Jordan and Egypt in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel and America\nTrying to confront the who the who are sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us and welcome as being a necessary course correction in the middle east\nOr I'm not sure they had any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not a I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish than his whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a rogue

we argue that the policy they actually required prior permission so they told the chief\nAfterward that oh no you can't write a book on your own time for a Bible study unless you get prior permission from the city and the city allows you to do so we challenge that as being unconstitutional he's only five permission needed is the first amendment and the judge ruled with us\nI'm so that the judge

you seemed extremely jolly\nThe one aspect of his speech that has gotten all the attention I don't need to play for you because it's in that CNN and CBS and NBC or all over it and let me just acknowledge\nI think it was unfortunate I don't think it was a good thing that the president said that it was a praise worthy or a vet that basically Congressman John forte Greg Gianforte Montana he was in ... in Missoula\nAnd congressman Gianforte and at the time I thought that John forte handle it very well he lost his temper he body slammed reporter he knocked off his glasses there were charges brought against him he pleaded guilty he apologized lavishly he made a legal settlement with the reporter he had assaulted\nAnd I've spoken that Congressman John forte this was one of the most embarrassing moments of his wife\nAnd I don't think it's a a good idea for president from to make light of it I don't mean cars when John forte would think that however what struck me about this is this is that that was a tiny segment of a very long and very substantive speech actually what Trump was doing and I think in a fairly effective way\nWas laying out\nThe way he's going to be campaigning and very close Senate races in very close governor's races as a Republican trying to help other Republicans and Trump last night was in Montana where the Senate races become unexpectedly

to be\nGoing to be an election of those\nOkay and these talking about the Kavanaugh the caravan\nAnd common sense and I think he threw in off off script the idea of law and order but that that to find a look in terms of Kavanaugh obviously because of the treatment of a justice Kavanaugh\nThat has mobilized lots of Republicans and there are lots of congressional races they are now the official people who do the polling and the banning and things like that say there is a one out of three chance that Republicans hold the house\nIt used to be down to one out of six so right now Republican prospects are surging even in the house of representatives and that's a good thing and part of it is because yes\nWith their response to justice Kavanaugh the Democrats show that they're not the party of jobs they're the party of well we'll let the president delivers on line but\nThe choice but not be more clear Democrats but just mobs Republicans reduce jobs [noise]\n\nMan see\nDemocrats they wanna raise your taxes they want to impose socialism on our incredible nation they could Venezuela because that's what's going to have [noise] they want to take away your health care because you won't

first year of Trump's presidency or the first part of the first year of Trump's presidency sound like tripled\nWhere it was when Trump became president of the rates in September were staggering and that's why I think President Trump is absolutely right to make an issue of this caravan then and by the way the evidence appears to be as of a half hour ago\nThat there was some progress getting

be no end to it\nIt will encourage more and more and more and more and look it's it's a question here not of whether we rearrange our immigration system to make it more sensible maybe even more compassionate\nBut right now the question was this caravan is whether we have an immigration system at all\nOr whether we simply raise the borders any kind of meaningful distinction\nAnd uh I think frankly President Trump is looking at this thing going on how is this going to work out either as he is going to win victory and turn the caravan back\nWhen he was going to be some kind of awful disaster\nAnd I think the incoming president of Mexico undress Lopez Manuel Obrador\nUm has a\n... actually shown some willingness to work with the Trump Administration on\nStopping this caravan which is crucial I've been a from a said this about\nThe economy and related it of course of the fact that there are more and more people coming across the border\nSuch an incredible autonomy I have so many [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay uh probably the rhetoric I created so much I've done this and\nYou know and that's not ideal rhetoric but look the fact is the economy has done better that's what we're going to be talking about was even more coming up and and just a moment\nThe point over here and I think it's very striking is everybody knows what Trump says everybody knows where Trump stands everybody knows what Trump has to say about this has anyone heard a\nAny kind of meaningful democratic response on this issue of the caravan\nBecause I've heard nothing all they do is they attacked Trump and that's not a policy being anti Trump is not a policy and last night they\nDon't work the new democratic superstar the great hope for Democrats not just for two that an Eighteen but for two thousand twenty

no there has to be out there has to be some orderly\nAbsolutely right yeah yeah I mean we we are absolutely agree on that let me let me go back to to one thing that the Democrats have been lying about and they literally lie about this every day and the media never call them on it\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and helped to design the those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line\nActually ... this year so we've asked the biggest tax cuts in three years and we actually have a slight increase Rob is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nUh continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenue to put people into work at ... businesses profitable businesses back to the United states which is happening\nUh but yeah what the problem is spending and you know people say oh you're just a robbery Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans or Democrats this bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for this\nAnd you like a President Trump's ah idea\nVast amount every department to cut five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's where businesses do you know that that's the thing if you're running a business and you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your age is and that's what businesses did during the recession they talked\nIn their stomach they tighten their belts they got rid of an efficient workers and an efficient services and things that they didn't need and they save money and they became profitable getting we never do that in government and by the way I Would like your one listener\nI Love your show Paul endear show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ... the one aspect of Trump's America First program that he\nTalked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement a where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories\nAnd warehouses and and apartments and that that is a structure we need pipelines we need ... terminals we need oil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our porch\nA lot of that Michael I think can be good to be done with private money it doesn't why what where does it say that the government has to pay for all this stuff\nI think that's a great ... points for President Trump to borrow from other book trumping nominates and from my friend and guess Stephen Moore
