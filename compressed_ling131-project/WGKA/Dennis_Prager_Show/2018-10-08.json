officer who was convicted of second degree murder a lot of people are texting about\nThat a lot of people in Chicago land had watched that case very very closely Mike wants to weigh in and Mike I very much appreciate you hanging in there whether it's thanks so much for your patience how are you\nGood thanks um yeah I think I think there's a bigger client um I mean I think it's a it's pretty sad day for law enforcement ... course of\nCourse it anytime of police officers convicted it's a sad day\nAnd I think it it directly you know the the side effect of came up this weekend three Chicago police officers were beaten in the first the lady that was actually getting ... said she was unsure of using her up and sure each other the scrutiny\nAnd that there is nothing new about that scrutiny however these camcorders and these body cams\nAnd I'm as pro police as they come and why we dedicate so much time to assisting the families of officers have been killed in the line of duty so you you won't get an argument for me about how bad the conviction this officer was however this look I mean you got a guy walking down the street with a knife in his hand trying to veer away from the officer and he pulls he shoots sixteen times\nYou're not going to have any other outcome than that one and the video tape the tape confirmed it these body cams and these dash cameras\nOften vindicate officers but if an officer errors if he makes a mistake ... there's going to be accountability for that police officers know that\nI mean I think five Fifteen times are sixteen shots whatever it was this was a bit of overkill but I mean what I what out there without the heat of the above it I mean who knows he could have easily have cut you know what I mean there's there's a lot of other often that could have happened and who knows maybe if you didn't shoot him Jason Van Dyke might have been dead\nYou well you you don't know except that there was too much distance between the two of them it was not a good shooting Mike and and the video confirmed it but believe me I I don't take any joy and that what I Do think is important is that you remember\nAnd you know you make a great point about police officers being reluctant to use their weapon and how how ... I Wonder how many times an officer now is going to be a beaten or killed because it happened in South Carolina Greenville South Carolina there was a\nThey had a policy about not being able to pull your weapon out of a holster and they were chasing the guy the guy turned around and ambush the officer shot him dead\nUh is uh that's one of the perils of police work and and police know that ultimately though\nOn balance it's better to have a video recording of it\nAs a as if the officer could be vindicated which is Ninety nine percent of the time [noise]\nAgain Baskin the victory but

peoples and in the western hemisphere as a result of Europeans coming [noise] so what was the choice my friends [noise]\nThe vast majority of\nThose ... indigenous peoples Native Americans who were killed in a who died after the European arrived in North America the vast majority of smallpox they simply had no immunity against the European disease\nOr so you go to college you probably learned that the British tried to infect Indians who was the British and writing a biography of Andrew Jackson bills exactly would that one guy thought oh OK let's let's take a blanket\nFrom an infected the soldier and give it a blanket throw infected so it was given the ... the never materialized nothing happened and and that's not how you've transmitted anyway\nUh bought the that's that's what you'll hear about that they were they were deliberately infected with smallpox you know how many your European Americans died of smallpox obviously not as many because there were certain immunity\nAnyway what I say well was the choice I mean what was the choice should nobody could come here\n\nShould have just been left basically Baron\nYou're ... you think it was ... it was a mic deficits to humanity

those who who are angry that he was sworn in it and let us a match in for a moment that he didn't do what he did what he is alleged to have done in high school and high school\nWas a match and he didn't do you feel sorry for him\nTo this is like this is a question like the one that I posed to atheist when I Know I might dealing with someone with intellectual honesty I ask atheist do you hope you are right or role\n\nIn out if they feel says of course I Hope I'm wrong\nIf you think I I don't hope there's an afterlife you'd think I Hope this ultimate justice you think I Hope this ultimate meaning you think I Hope I'm just a glitch in in a universe that could you know as much\nConcern for me as adults for pebble on Jupiter of course I Hope is a God but I've just concluded that there isn't I respect that atheist both the atheist\nSays I Hope I'm right I Hope there is nothing\nThere's oblivion for eternity okay that I have to say I don't find that person has thought through honestly likewise here\nIf you can't feel sorry on the assumption I'm making the assumption that you didn't do what he's alleged to have done in high school do you feel sorry for the man\nBut I Would say the vast majority of people on the left not liberals but on the left\nDo not feel would not feel sorry for the man\nBecause there's a meanness that pervades left as I'm In fact what is it one didn't somebody tweet from the Stephen Colbert their show or what was that again Oh yes at least we ruined his life\nThat's that's true that's their aim aim is to ruin the lives of those they differ with that makes them feel good\nYou know I might disdain for Hillary Clinton is now like just the stain of left this for ... capital let's say but I don't want to ruin her life I I it doesn't even occur to me as a desire or joy I have no desire to ruin her life\n\nOr I don't know I don't even know it doesn't stop the it's not the the the way I think at least we ruined his life\n\nSomebody sent

always prided myself on my willingness to be fair to be bipartisan and to be open to new ideas I enjoy friendships that are diverse but this isn't\nThat doesn't mean that there are no mature singles ... nobody would argue that single makes you mature that's all everybody who's been married even if they've been divorced the colleges that they mature through marriage\nThese women are as wild in their way as men are wild and their way when they're not bonded with someone in the formality known as marriage but of course by generation began and\nIt's continuing today an unraveling of of western
