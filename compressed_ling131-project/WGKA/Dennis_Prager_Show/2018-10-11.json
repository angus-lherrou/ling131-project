reference to this for decades but I have now put it in the context of the current political situation\nI Believe that we will be seeing more violence from the left and I would like to give you\nErie as to why I ... I mean my first theory I wrote up a few weeks ago in a very important column I know it's important because it got just on town hall if you were twenty two thousand\nBut what is it again why do I forget that we're not forwards a when people pass on some no no no come on guys [noise] shares yes I don't know why it's I think of shares in terms of stocks I think that's the problem anyway\nI wrote the first reason I Believe that is that the left there like liberals again the left do not believe that they are obligated\nTo the to society's rules of of behavior facts Hillary Clinton said that just now did you see that\nWe have we ever saying if we have a clip\nOr on the way if we do I would like to get it I Want and the Eric Holder that's exactly right when they're down ...\n... ... ... you know there are down so we take the high road they take the low road and when they're on the low road we kick him right so there there are absolute invitations to violence and of course I mean\nViolence is a complex term in some ways is it violent to scream with people while they're having dinner at a restaurant\nWho the interesting question if in other words if you're not touched is there is there ought to bow violence is the only sense that can be involved in violence the sense of touch a it's an honest question but anyway\nThe second reason this is my new idea the second reason the left will be violent is this I'd like to read to you this actually is ... is a a\nSomething I cite in my Bible commentary in certain chapter forty six of genesis about out yet coming up sprint anyway so let me tell you where it's from okay\nIt's from three professors Roy bound my sister who's been on my show with major criminology bread Bushman and W. Keith Campbell in an article called self esteem narcissism and aggression\n\nDoes violence results from low self esteem or from threatened the ego wisdom\nWhat matters is self esteem or ... I think Russia that's the name of the peace if it was published\nFebruary two thousand in current directions and psychological science ... it's the journal of the association of psychological science you are you a new one every couple of years you know you never let it lapse that's impressive it is just impressive so why you wouldn't\nBe everybody the the article so these are all professors\nSelf esteem north ... I'm an aggression from current directions in psychological science from ... from the year two\nThousand now I'm going to go to it until you address the simple one paragraph conclusion violent men seem to have a strong sense of personal superiority\nYou hear that\nI told you this many times citing boy bound meister\nThat in his study of criminals which is his whole life work he found that\nThey have violent criminals had fire self esteem than the general population\nI continue favorable self regard is linked to violence in one sphere after another murderers rapists wife theaters violent youth gangs aggressive nations and other categories of violent people\nAre all marked by strongly held views of their own superiority\nWhen large groups of people differ in self esteem the group with the higher self esteem\nIs generally the more violent one\nThat is why the left will be violent I'm about to exactly right [noise] I uh I'm tying in various trends though that I have brought to your attention throughout my radio career\nIs exceedingly important to understand the roots of the self esteem movement they are completely on the west John ... a left wing state senator in California I interviewed the man\nI understand where he came from why he pushed forth and California passed that I wrote against that what you could you take a look what the year was California\nDelegated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the self esteem movement\nAnd of course it caught caught on we're even conservative parents started thinking about their kids self esteem as being important\nWhy do you think kids get trophies for losing [laughter] why because of the self esteem of but we don't want our kids to feel bad about himself\nWhy not why not\nYou should always feel proud always really no matter the lack of achievement in your life then what's the point of cheap and\nIf you're going to feel just as good about yourself if you fail as if you succeed well Bob ... that I took those that line straight from the study in\nThe journal of psychological science\nThe self esteem moving originates on the left it permeates the left that is the reason normal rules of behavior don't apply you can call the president of the United states a Nazi\nBecause the normal rules of moral this course do not apply to you if you're on the left you are so good you are so rights and rights is\nThat you don't need\nTo live by that's by the way that is you don't need to live by Bridgewater rule that is the reason remember Amy wax to the law professor at the University of Pennsylvania also on our show\nLiterally half of her fellow lawyers wanted her to leave or stop teaching her courses at University of Pennsylvania law school because she wrote that the bourgeois middle class values of self restraint\nThat permeated America from after the war to about Nineteen sixty forty five to six the were good\nGet married before you have children\nGraduated high school work hard\nAh be ah oh this this ... this really drove them crazy respect authority oh my God that drives the left the most crazy you can't tell me what to do police you can't tell me what to do teachers you can't tell me what to do parents\nThe state can tell me what to do but nobody else [noise]\n\nThis is this is why I predict is is a predicted especially if they lose the congressional elections you're listening to the dentist Prager show won a Prager seven seven six\nWe have very high and I always hard and so someone isn't greener yelling at me or not agreeing with me\nIf it's truly something that I blame it doesn't really bother me and I never thought of myself as little as I wrote in any way but I can guarantee you I have a lot of self esteem so I guess\nI Want to limit on it or you know it's an important subject what do you think of giving trophies to kids are on losing teams\nWhich they did give us a call ... so you okay so I have two theories about your notion of self esteem which would be bored with buying one is\nThat there is when you said I Want you to know your child with God I couldn't agree with you more that's not the self esteem that the psychologist to talking about with regards to rapists and murderers and the like\nAnd that that they they don't walk around thinking I Am a child of God I promise you know okay so I agree with you in that we are all in God's image this gives us a certain ...\nThat is unique to every one of us I I I learned that as a child in my religious school and I believe it\nThe self esteem they're talking about is I Am terrific\nI don't think you told your children you are terrific\nAnd we you know okay there you are even laughing now that so that that proves by point so there's there at the other is you believe I I won't put any words in your mouth I'll tell you say I Believe I Believe in er into self esteem I totally believe if you have done well and you have done good\nThen you should think a highly or or well a viewer cheap and that's a very that's a totally healthy thing\nOkay so I think we're on board on that\nThe self esteem movement wanted you to feel good about yourself no matter how you behaved irrespective of religion vest can sell us grew up Catholic got very angry at his Catholic upbringing rejected it this is a secular self esteem yours is religious self esteem\nI think there's a big difference I don't see ...

reactions\nBut one is this this is this is the level of American media today but this is reported to if you don't think that there are a fair number of teachers who are fools we'd like to glamorize teachers\nAnd by the way I actually believe that the prayer for our teachers that took place that the Supreme Court the liberal Supreme Court struck down\nI'm In Nineteen sixty two there was a prayer for the teacher in it and I and I believe that I grew up the future was always right that was my the the viewer in my home teacher hit me the teacher was\nRight however I have come to appreciate the fact that thanks to left his him there's a serious percentage of teachers who were fools\nJust mean stupid fools his teacher was one of them\nWho the hell are you to tell the media about a third grade

even mention names 'cause I don't have such a strong policy about ... humiliating people the vis gummy thing you did here\nOnly reflects on you only only not on Stephen Miller\nFor you to go to the media and tell them what a public figure was like in third grade in a derogatory way is this what is going to happen now we don't want to send our kids to schools because if they get successful in life the third grade teacher is going to save the kid peed in\nClass we had kids like that we've called Marines kids who couldn't control their bladder even even in the early grades of elementary

twenty five years ago but he's he's only thirty three years old oh that's\nFascinating senior advisor to the president\nThat's another reason not to send your kids to school to home school them\n\nThe the poisoning of too many of our teachers by left ism has had a terrible impact\nTeachers if you're a teacher won't call the kids in the class boys and girls because she doesn't want to or he doesn't want to impose gender identity take kids out of the school\n\nI mean if that if that's not enough to have to remove your kid from a school that your son will be called a boy or in your daughter won't be called the girl\nOr that and then literally nothing would would stop you from sending their kids to school uh but uh I Wonder I Wonder if I'd like to ask the teachers' unions in the country what do you think of a teacher ... negatively reporting hum a public figure from third grade\nDo you think if I should watch an apostrophe that they would all know\nThere is what I'm Serious\nI'd be very

like it's sort of an obscure\nArt but I I find that all that you can't hand write anything you have to print it like a like a child I don't know ... you know that's\nMaybe I'm I mean it sincerely

simply say with the ... were the air force and they are the the army Charlie Kirk do you agree with that assessment\nCouldn't agree more Dennis and you're the you're the commander in chief general over at all or your wife though it's an honor to be on your show I'm a I'm an avid listener daily listener you're\nOffered so much clearer run a cloud of chaos and the political ... and so it's an honor to be with you truly\nWell that you are armed very touch because of who you are so thank you but I I Want to focus on you and your book and the news items that I just read about you and ... but first let me tell everybody she has written this book campus battlefield\nHow conservatives can win the battle on campus\nAnd why it matters so campus battlefield the book is up with them as ... dot com\nIf anybody knows the campus battlefield is turning point you have people all over the country at universities all over the country who are members of TPP will say I folks have spoken for his conventions\nAre all around the country I Will be at Newport Beach him knows who's just we can do\nAnd I was in Florida for you and you know I just want people to know I spoke ... what was it was Washington DC 'cause I remember the the Donald Trump junior was with me a behind the scenes fair and are you at twenty five hundred students didn't you\nThat that's correct yeah you spoke to our high school audience and you spoke to us from Palm Beach and in fact you also a book at our chapter at the University of Wyoming or ... or ... people felt that I was an excellent speech and\nI think our chapter at Colorado State university is also hosting you are in the near future as well so uh\nI just want people to know how much we worked together it's it's it's a terrible thing and that's the reason I mentioned that but I just want people understand twenty five hundred students from around the country use it achievement such a very big deal and I I just want to salute you for that\nAnd it is when you go to something like that my ... you get some optimism show you or your ... title of your book is how conservatives can win\nThe battle on campus All right go ahead and we're right why don't we wish him\nWell first of all the premise that I come forth in this book is one that you talk about a lot which is\nWhat we believe we're in you know civil war and it's the culture war for the soul of this country and politics as Andrew Breitbart used to say it bugs downstream from culture and the most in court vertical and culture is our universities um they are they're filled with ...\nProfessor relief but as you're always constantly say Dennis they're not very much wisdom that goes on there and what what I found by touring these campuses\nIn speaking at you know over a hundred a year and now having an organization that spans Thirteen hundred a gram across the country is that it's not that students are opposed the conservative ideas\nIs that they're not exposed them at all the first place bravo and so and and the ... books that are put together in this book or factually ... and it it said it in some ways it ... increasing ocean but we have to show up it's remarkable\nTo me how many students are searching for this message they have a desire to hear a different viewpoint and for whatever reason the universities have silent film and it's quite simple my conclusion I've come to is they hate the idea that there are other ideas\nAre black not liberal there's very few liberal out there anymore but aware\nThat they are focused on silencing any opinion that might ... bear monolithic um control over the intellectual an ideological um viewpoint of a generation and so just just yesterday I spoke in South Florida we packed a room with eight hundred students\nDay before that we had two thousand students at the University of Georgia\nWait a minute wait whoa that's a big deal it it really\nIs you weren't wait you ... you would you you wouldn't campus or just you got\nThat candidate selling myself that she was the real draw so I kind of just\nGo oh you're just humble guy okay I mean you're both ... but that that's very significant to forgive me I Want to underscore what you should be very briefly\nThe issue my dear dear listeners is they have never heard our side it is not so much that they are from the left is that they have no idea that there was a non molest way of approaching life\nThat's exactly right and and what would I find the work that pregnant university does and what we're doing on the ground is that when students are presented these arguments and logical factor\nRiver um non feeling sense if you will because every ... dogs is rooted in the ocean\nAnd it's rooted in Queens and as you caught so many millions of people Dennis very few people care about how you feel we care about how you act and even more importantly what you think and why you think about what you do and so we have found is that\nStudents that have any sort of ambition\nStudents that have any sort of sense of human decency or wants to do something in their lives\nOn there's no way they can find a Harvard remarried\nBecause the left is all about tribal identity politics\nIt is about you can never you can never improve yourself you have to blame the external for any sort of suffering that you might be being experiencing sort student that might have what some would say classical liberal years on gay marriage or abortion they're leaving the last in record numbers\nBecause if they didn't believe in some stepped on the free enterprise\nOr they think that black only dormitories or a bad idea then all of a sudden they're considered to be a right wing or or a conservative at the at the universities and so the second part that I highlight in this book is how radical the universities have become\nAnd it it is important for your listeners to understand the Democrat Party the sixties and seventies but JFK type Democrats those are considered to be fringe right wing radicals dial on college campuses if you believe that there are two genders you if you believe in free enterprise\nSystem if you believe America is the greatest country ever to exist those are considered fringe ideology and because of that you know the ... some ways doing us a favor it allows us to recruit decent minded students that\nQuite frankly say there's no way I Want to believe in this cultural Marxist world view that is being shut down my throat by my professors um and then the third point I make in the book which is really really important is how the conservative business community has subsidized that's through they're giving over the last couple of decades\nUm it is amazing to me you know you walk you walk the halls of Harvard or Yale or Princeton a majority of the big gifts that are given at these universities where the worst indoctrination occurs is thanks to the giving of conservative successful business people\nThat have allowed the Marxist to have unlimited amount of funds to indoctrinate\nGeneration after generation and so it's really a call to action to parents and two alumni to stop giving money to a university not give it to ... university that the different\nStopped giving money your actual school you went to first of all they don't need it sucking up they're going to use your money to go against your values are program a generation to hate America and that that really needs to be reinforced that I go through all this ... levels are given how universities corrupt\nThe uh the ... process and how they deceived owners into thinking of going forward the targeted on initiative or program when in reality\nIt goes for opioid cultural studies or feminist studies and allow the professors to continue their um\n... book the book folks again is campus battlefield Charlie Kirk founder and president of turning point usa the book is up but then it's pretty good about kombucha please tell my audience what has happened with the poll university\nYeah I mean DePaul University which is a private school in Chicago a Catholic school um has\nThis allowed I get a turtle that that can just don't like that myself are not allowed on after next week\nDespite the fact that we followed all their protocol odd that we feel about all the forms that they asked us to you and and they're they're not that they really and that's a common tactic of the left which is the mayor and when you disagree with that and that and Charlie Kirk on they express violent language that could be demeaning towards\nBy the way I Want you to know that that is another example of why I say the left law he's with the ease with which you breathe this isn't is that you wouldn't engage in violent language give the example she said she's black and she said black shouldn't vote Democrat and that is considered violent language\nThe correct answer so the ... the actor for the law they learn that all they have to have seven or eight here to feel they're threatened by a bigger and better ... within a moment's notice\nAnd throw the activists have been trained by the ... factors Hooper important professor or not\nHe can they are claiming mhm is he\nAllowed the crack dialogue it allows the agreement that allows you point divert bitter is the professors have none of that that anger and they're really really good at it\nSchool all movies every child ... ideas do right what have you ever like I'm Better than I did in\nThe only thing that there is only right so there are only two ways and that is to to consider not sending your kid to a school and home schooling them\nA is a two and two and to provide a positive alternative and that is through the great books through the Bible through ... university videos I mean there's tremendous there was a tremendous amount of great stuff out there but the the first that what do you\nRegret even ... yeah\nOf course I ... well you know why but the Bible hasn't been infiltrated [laughter] that's the part\nPart of the reason I'm writing by my book which to my father or her shock came in that the number one national bestseller nonfiction number one number two in all book sold in America on Amazon what came out in may\nIf that doesn't show you a thirst for exactly uh what I'm trying to do are rational presentation in defense of the Bible and why it's the best books ever written\nNothing all I never imagined that it would be that successful the rush of a Bible but\nAre they ... everything has been co-opted which that is true he's right but we're we're fighting back that's why it's so important to the upcoming election it's why it's so important that you vote if the Democrats do in the house they're not expected to win the Senate but if they don't win the house which you know the blue wave\nThat will be an enormous statement in this country they've tried everything the entire media has devoted two years\nTo undermining the Republican ascendancy the presidency forget Donald Trump please give me a break you think if if my parents were president they would be any different history of course not of course not\n\nThey don't want an alternative they know they the the giving up of power is not the left doesn't give up power as if they're not used to it\nThat's why they went crazy on Capitol a conservative court for the first time or I Would say since since Nineteen sixty forty fifty eight years the first time in fifty eight years the left doesn't control the court\nThis is this is intolerable\nYork Times when we come back I Want to read to
