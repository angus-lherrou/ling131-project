{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "They're a very talented team and this is a game that I think that\nWe we need to not give them hope early uh\nBecause if they get a little hope I think that that is going to be a really tight for or against a\nLittle bit of a reflection on last week I thought the very first play the game when ... had a great past breakup that kind of set the tone for your defense\nYeah no question and a and set the tone for the day I mean I think um we had a bunch of past breakups where\nYou know we just made the competitive play that was a big key for us going into the game because we knew the ball is going to go up there leading passing off and it's been in the conference and leading in third down in the country and\nAnd now there's quarterback was really really good but we we were well positioned ah we play a good technique we broke on the ball we didn't have a bunch of ... and all that stuff we played clean\nBut uh that was a huge boy I thought that really set up a book and you saw it all day I mean more fields had passed break because Trayvon no entire had a big past break up where they had passed breakups I mean we had a bunch of them\nSo a new set of big past break up a so just to a very good day for us on the back in and hopefully good momentum and confidence for those guys going to this game because this is another really good passing team very good quarterback a in some outstanding receivers and tidy and\nTrevor Lawrence had his first three hundred yards passing game I don't think I could remember as many passes across the field to sideline us as we were saying on the broadcast forty art out\nPattern city just rifle the right there\nYeah ... he's a ... it's it's easy you know to the neck it out to see how talented he is when\nYou just purely watching throw the football especially when you watch them make some of those throws would the type of velocity he can make to the field and uh you know I I Know those ... they're all pro scouts there see family\nAnd uh you know I'm I'm sure they couldn't help but take a peek that guy and his arm talent is is pretty special that's for sure\nBut the the game is slowing down for him you know he's starting to really process things like we needed to be he's he's seeing the defenses he's been exposed to a lot after seven games on our practice field and on the game feel\nSo he's he's a very smart young man he don't forget\nA male make some mistakes but he usually doesn't repeat them and so just really proud of him because he's got that great on but now he's processing quicker he's playing faster he's flipping protections and then he's making plays with his legs because he's recognizing those opportunities are when they present themselves\nYes because of the protections I or go ... Scott I think it was earlier this week did a a ... interview saying that seven out of eight times he flipped protections distributes correctly\nYeah he did a great job force he really did he's a a\nAgain it was beyond as years and um I think came into the season well prepared but as he played\nA he's just gotten very comfortable and and as he seen so many different things from defense is\nUm it's it's it's making sense to him and and uh and then he's nippy leading the cadence more to to get tips on the defense to create the movement in the defense so then he can recognize it and do what he needs to do from a protection standpoint so\nHe's in a good place and um I think that he's still got a lot of room for improvement and I'm excited to see what he can do down the stretch\nFully back with more than a priority one security pregame show with coach Sweeney as the countdown kickoff continues this assault orange Clemson football on at Clemson Tigers network\nOh you are responsible person to find yourself going deeper and credit card debt then get money for a toll free number that will put you on a path to financial recovery community debt management\nWill consolidate doing accounts and work with your creditors you'll save thousands and become debt free for keeps if you're a debt has you down we should talk called trinity at one eight hundred nine nine oh six nine seven six one eight hundred nine nine oh six nine seven six one eight hundred nine nine oh sixty nine Seventy six\nPat Boone here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a\nPain relief product not until now it's not until relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain quite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to aging exercise\nAnd everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night\nFor keeping you from taking it was nice long walks or\nPlaying golf or tennis you can't really call it a living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor may be all you need to lower or even eliminate these pain\nWhole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start\n\nOh thank you well have you on the phone did you ... the capital ...

the party won pre game show was coach dabble Sweeney I'm timber ray and the coach when you look at Florida State statistically a you you kinda wonder I kind of wander going in are we going to have\nThe ... have to have the same type of approach from the standpoint of Florida State his aides in the country and in Russian defense or the global they have the same approach that as you stay Kennedy to stop the run stop BBN and made the freshman ...\nYeah I I make just to kind of see as well uh we don't know quite as much about these people you know we don't have quite the history with down new staff and all that\nUm we were much more confident in what we're going to get in the state 'cause you know they are who they are and I think that's one of the reasons that they've been successful as they don't try to be a lot of different things they get good at what they do um but plus I don't think they\nHad really seen Trevor do it they seem to make big place but you heard that in Dave's comments leading up to it he didn't feel like that that had been pressure so\nWe were he pretty much tipped his hand all we know we we knew that hey we're not going to let you they're not going to let you run the ball\nAnd we're going to see if there's quarterback and can make plays well we answered that so I think that the tape that for state has this study's all different and uh so I think what will see them as bill mix it up a little bit more I think we'll get a more of a combination\nOf opportunity a to run the ball and and where they play coverage and things like that but\nUh so we get we got to get down in on early and kind of see just exactly what their plans are going to be the good news is is is a our system we have answers built in a Trevor Trevor school to be he understands what he needs to what he needs to do and you know just like last week which we tried to run the ball a lot\nBut a lot of those run calls turned in the past is based on the looks that we were given and that's just what we do we believe in match ups and I'm\nSo it'll be interesting so some of those same run calls this week may turn it around and so then it comes down to can you execute at the point of attack we had last week we had a lot on black guys that were made some place on us um\nAnd so we weren't as efficient running the ball a but uh this week I think there'll be more opportunity and hopefully we can be more efficient and even still a there was more there last week then we got and so we all saw that on tape and and we're eager to to get that running game back on a back on track\nTo get to see the best set a defensive end you've seen all year\nYeah these guys are really good you know Ninety nine burns leads the nation and sex I mean he's he's he they're as good as will say I mean there and there's not just him I mean they've got therefore they got four guys that they'll roll in there that could play for anybody they're typical Florida State and\nThey're they're they're inside guys are huge uh just big big strong heavy handed guys very similar to the NC State guys inside built stopped the run\nA but their ends can flag it after the pastor so this'll be a challenge for Mitch and terrain out on the edge a match to kind of see that match up and um and then and then this will be you know they're back seven is really talented I mean the ... ten years the head coach we beat them in recruiting one time\nWhen it comes to recruiting racking so that's what the experts say anyway so they got all kinds of guys that are fast and and and and can run so um we're gonna have to be precise in what we do\nAh be decisive than what we do and we got a windows competitive plays on the outside and then we got to win that we've got to physically when the match up up front and find some way to control a lot of scrimmage for Trevor so\nA big challenge I think this defense is is a is done a great job at this point and and uh hopefully our defense or will set the tempo the other way uh you know I think that they've had some issues up front office of wine but they kind of gotten better here down the stretch and et cetera lentils and guys so\nAnthony Grant and
