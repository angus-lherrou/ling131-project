in Rochester, Minnesota I knew my when they all had to be there the founder of my pillow you see him in your medicine cabinet coming out to other of the counter saying you've got to get a great night sleep used my pal\nAdmire very very much and proud to represent on the radio every chance I get this incredible company the most perfect pillow you'll ever sleep on the mattress topics that I look around in a in a big huge canvas bag like a dead body\nUm it it's a I look very scary bringing my mattress chopper with me when I travel on the road the doggie beds and of course Mike was that the big rally last night how you doing Mike\nI'm doing great thanks for having me on my how did it really was there I got I got to be speaker\nYou spoke I knew you had you know you made along you one of the road you travel with President Trump did a shout out to North Dakota a couple of months ago so now you you were part of the actual the ... the whole show last night huh\nYeah it was the pre show that I met with the president back job at age ... in the back and not [noise] but yeah I went up there I spoke for five minutes and it was a couple of good lines I said what about my dad was everybody loves our president they just don't know it yet\n[laughter] I'm sure you've heard the news the Rasmussen poll he's up again now fifty one percent\nSo you know according to rouse most in the majority of voters approve of the job he's doing Phil forty eight percent disapprove Mike if you don't mind hold back the curtain a little bit the ... you get a chance to visit with the president last night in Rochester\nYes\nWhat tell how is the what what would it would tell us about his attitude his spirit ... what what what is he liked to be in a room with him one on one\nHe's he's so uh\nUh you know what people don't realize bought him such great listener so awesome let's say he picks up the ... and ... and takes the time to listen to each person and and then put together comes out with these amazing commonsense answers and he was very just very calmly ... confident is the word I Would use\nAnd they they asked me that through on that on the news yesterday Minnesota you know what a\nYou know how it's affecting Minnesota and why do you put it all to the president said just unbelievable optimism and confidence is it's infectious everybody you're just you're gone and you can't deny that everything he says just coming true and and here but he's just very uh\nUh he was very confident about a cabin out and a very ... is just copy and everything he does and he said and it's just a\nYou know you just wonder why I guess why everybody just you know it should be it's just kinda keep getting higher though by people just aren't going wow look at this but it does look ugly it's amazing things that are getting done and [noise] I\nA vote to put the vote [noise] um the justice up for vote [noise]\nYou cannot closed debate and culture it's cold\nAnd you cannot extrapolate necessarily from that vote to how they will vote in actuality\nSo you can vote for cloture and then vote against Brett Kavanaugh so it is not a given at all in my mind that he will\nBe\nNominated by a spy or chosen ratified ... confirmed by the U.S Senate is not a given\nI heard and I have to verify heard that a Republican senator from Montana and will be attending his daughter's wedding he's walking her down the aisle some Saturday\nSo that would deprive the Republicans of another vote already Lisa Murkowski she even voted against cloture now it's theoretically possible she would vote for Kavanaugh having voted for cloture but it is unlikely\n\nI just my heart breaks for the man and uh I don't know what else I can tell you\nI have made my case from the beginning that it did not deserve eat a U.S Senate hearing\nYou cannot make a high school accusation that has never been made against any one Republican or Democrat with zero corroboration and have the United States Senate close its functions and an entertainment your\nCharge\nIt just wouldn't be done with anything else\nYou know we uh we we saw him in gay I saw him engage in an armed robbery\nAnd high school I think they would have stopped the U.S Senate for that hearing a fully credible person I saw Brett Kavanaugh engaged in an armed robbery armed robbery when he was a junior in high school\n\nAnd guess what I Khamenei the people who uh who saw him do it then every one of them says I don't know what the person's talking about including one of them who is a best friend\nOf the person making the accusation\nSo why is why did the why does the U.S government shutdown\nWhy does the U.S population preoccupied with one charge from one woman from high school thirty five years ago why and we all know why because we live in the age as stated by\nA professor Alan Dershowitz at Harvard law school a lifelong liberal Democrat Hillary Clinton supporter we live in the age of sexual McCarthyism that is why\n[noise]\nI I don't and he said it's darker it's a darker period than that and this is a liberal Democrat but one of the only honest ones are only really liberals with courage liberals are not leftist but they are but they are very weak\n... except the case and the rare case of an Alan Dershowitz who has told me personally and on film to me you will see it in my movie without them curl up no safe spaces next year\nAnd said to me that he is far more afraid of the left than of the right\n... well listen to it and see it was all it took her ... she was like\nThis is the this is sexual McCarthyism right I mean think of it ladies and gentlemen I Wonder if somebody had said he committed murder in high school whether they would have been a hearing\nI doubt it you have any corroboration you have a dead body\nYou have witnesses no and no on all counts I'm Sorry murder is the worst thing that a person can engage in nevertheless we can't stop the engines of government of the United states of America because one person makes one I'm corroborated charges murder\nTell me where by analogy is by analogy improper Coley tell tell me you are listening tell me why this happened on what\nWere the hearings held say this is what I this is what I said from the beginning I was attacked by conservatives in the Washington Post National Review and elsewhere and I maintain that my original position was correct\nAll these conservatives do uh is feed the beast\nYes look at what you can do to ruin a man's reputation man who hundreds of women of all backgrounds and the whole political persuasion Z have affirmed is such a decent man\n\nI I'm not sure that I have witnessed something like this in my lifetime and we've had this before with Clarence Thomas Clarence Thomas ... who is still used as a poster boy for sexual harassment\nAt worst he is accused of talking a mentioning sexual matters in a conversation a with a a was a would be ...\n\nI I happen for the record I happen to think that it's unwise to do I have not done that and I'm not a proponent of it I but I think it needs to be put in to perspective\nMean this is is it the statement of a woman cannot even here talk about sexual matters it is so it is so devastating it is I don't think is a is a affirmative a female strength I don't defend\nThey'd like you to share your story there's like you to email your representative your

that's your you don't like your job okay you have a good marriage All right so be happy\n\nTo be the ability you do have\nHappiness supplied as it were by every major avenue\nIs a rare warm for most people want any Prager Seventy seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six is the number if you take this seriously you can have\nA happier life it just it just doesn't work out for everybody to have every major area a happiness producer\nSo your task if you want to be happy as opposed to unhappy and I I this is one of the revelations of my life is how many people really don't work on being happy\nAnd I to me that's more amazing that people not working on their health but maybe it's maybe it's analogous\nYou know if if people did X Y or Z they would be healthier and they don't do it\nBecause I guess it's hard but maybe it's hard to be to work on being happy so\nIt is what it is but if you want to be happy or happy or you have to understand you have to accept the fact that very few people for very few people does life deliver him all arenas\nOf life that's that's key\nBecause otherwise what you do is you fixate on that which isn't good so this person was a a fair marriage that you know nothing to write home about and ... not worthy of divorce\nUnderstands that there are other avenues oh excuse me I Can't believe it I Can't believe I missed one\nI should send myself the punishment room but I've never I've never done that I've the punishment room is only earned for carelessness not for content but I don't know maybe I'm wrong maybe content should should apply anyway friends\nHow did I forget that one\nSo friends health marriage I said parents I ah\nKnow of course children I Know but I I'm thinking I it's the one includes parents in the look if you have wonderful parents it's a big bonus in life is all put parents and\nSo parents children friend's health work marriage there you go if you got 'em on all cylinders that I mean that's like having an

that's it's not most people can't afford it or just don't have a one eight Prager seven seven six\nI like you to call it obviously you have a question or um you see if you defer you know if you don't have one of those well the truth is if you don't have health that's a toughie\nI Would say of all of them that may be my might be the toughest but it depends what health means\nIf you if the health is debilitating or not for example Charles crowd hammer the wonderful late commentator and it was paralyzed almost fully from the neck down that's bad health but he he he was a fully functioning\nHighly functioning more functioning that most people who are paralyzed [noise]\nIndividual who loved life [noise]\nAnd every body you gotta find happiness where you can and few people have it in all the ...

this is from triple ... want if you do with the other person in your life fails to realize this can you be happy with someone who doesn't realize that she told me about a a a a love interest you're talking about a friend ...\nWell I Would answer it let's say even a spouse let's say you have a spouse that business on board and in these matters twice said then you still have the hopefully health friend's children parents\nOr work and remember or not and or to be sources of happiness this is so I wasn't I was kidding about nine point nine four seven six for three to four seven three six to but I'm not kidding about how important this is\nAnd you can't that's why ... quest was so important you can't pay this is how people live I'm not happy but I Will be happy when I get a raise\nWhen I have a better job when\nI moved to ah to Baltimore oh well it was a bad choice how I'm kidding Baltimore I'm kidding I'm totally kidding they'll be offended say when I get married when I have children when

[noise] so that's the story and let's go to your calls immediately Matty in Houston, Texas Hi Maddie Dennis Prager\nHuh OK yeah Hi er my my ... well well\nWell congratulations that is very exciting I'm very I'm happy that you're excited\nOr so I'll go go\nTo why have advice for you that is precious I could spend the next hour giving you advice [laughter]\n[noise]\nAh yes I Do so ah yeah here goes I'm just putting you on hold there [noise]\nSo what the what does it mean to be a bar or bought ... ... is the Hebrew word for commandment it's translated often as good deed and many commandments are good deeds but it means commandment\nSo let's take that seriously the notion in Judaism is that a gorilla twelve or a boy at Thirteen is now responsible\nFor their own Sims\nUntil now it did bad it was on your parents' record now it's on your record\nWhile one should be excited that they're ... one should be a little afraid to because now there is no protective shields between you and your morals record before God\nYou can't blame your parents as of tomorrow in fact\nParents say a prayer thanking God that they are now freed from from the moral record of their children I take that very seriously took it seriously when I was your age I took it seriously as the as the parent of two books two boys who have permits\nSo this is a spectacular notion I Am now responsible for my life it's the matter is the opposite of what is taught in America today to so many kids I'm not responsible for my life others are\nSo that's that's a big one that you now take control of your moral life\nAnd does that make sense\nWell oh ... okay thank you that's that's precious\nI'll give you another one the the on the word commandment do right I've said this often the biggest difference between my religious and I think Christians religious education and secular education in America today is this I was raised\nThey'll give you two differences I was raised obligation oriented kids today are raised rights oriented are you going to make a better human being whose preoccupied with his or her rights or his or her obligations\nI didn't hear the word rights to like got to college or where I knew the word obligations throughout throughout my life uh by the way it has to give you a real power for example\nThe uh uh Judaism and Christianity believe that that husband and wife have sexual obligations to the to their spouse\nYou say that today you're accused of advocating marital rape Huffington Post just accused me of marital rape second time I've been accused at least I Know of I'm sure doesn't know about that this doesn't times but I mean the big places because I wrote an article ten years ago\nAnd which I'm proud of and people should read it\nSaying that given the ... the importance of sex to a marriage if you love your husband\nAnd he loves you and he's a good man don't let mood alone determine whether you will have sex with him sometimes just habit because you love it that's called marital rape today\nThat I Believe that there are obligations I have obligations to my wife ... in in a whole host the berries and she has obligations to me in a whole host the various the other difference between a religious education and the sexual education\nI was told that the greatest problem in Dennis ... life is\nDennis prayer that is a religious school Christian school Jewish school\nThe biggest issue when your life is you\nSecular school biggest issue in life is American society sexism racism Z to phobia homophobia et cetera big difference say so those are my areas for Matty\nGood luck wouldn't it be fun if I showed up just flew to Houston and showed up\nI just you have no idea that there was a part of me that would love to do that\n[laughter] I don't know if the rabbi would be happy [laughter] uh ... let's see\nUh Andrew in Fort Worth high\nOf almost ... very well thank you\nFor the question the guy for you would you rather be your or respected and why\nIt depends by whom gotcha has helped\nMe by ... physical sense like I fear consequences for um ... my parents or my spouse\nI rather that America be feared than anything else so is it there are times where respected I think that uh I think if my children have no fear of me it wouldn't have been good that\nBut today at their ages in their twenties and thirties I don't I don't want them to fear me I don't I don't think that's that would be a good thing I Want them to respect me and love me but uh when they're when they're eight I Would like them to fear me you'll like this Andrew I asked I did an hour once\nIf you didn't do drugs when you were in high school or college or a say high school why not\nThe biggest the most common answer was because my mother would kill me\n\nThat's good and read or write Yes sir thank you very much appreciate your call\nIt a lot of young ... on the on the on this hour and on the male female and I'm a happy it's very interesting I have a theory on that or an oldie but for them but I remember I said I Would like America feared\nYeah I Do when America's fear there's more peace on earth if you like a piece you want America feared if you are like war than you don't want America feared and just want America like any other nation\nThat's why I said if the Nobel Peace\nWe're really awarded to those who deserve it\nThe American armed forces would get the Nobel Peace prize the greatest force for peace on earth is American might\nOK okay\nMail wine or why have a feeling that the current president would agree with that and the previous president would not it just it just a hunch okey dokey\nAnd we'll go to Cameron in Phoenix hello camera and all that that's how you doing real real well thank you for having friday\nI got a question

we'll be back I'm Dennis ...\nFly from the relief I\nThey they don't hurt the society for that belief they still give their kids to a polio shops and measles shots theyre not anti science\nSo uh that's that's the I I don't it's not an argument that I feel is critical I Believe I Believe that the first five books or indeed divide and the God is in the rest of the Bible\nBut I don't believe that it is it is a battle worth fighting over the literal ... of the days of the six days of creation\nAnd a title my work on the Bible the rational by boat and I try to be true to the title ...\n... tells me that it's billions of years old it is not one ... less a miracle if God created the universe in six days or in six billion years ... what what is the difference\nAnd by the way the Bible
