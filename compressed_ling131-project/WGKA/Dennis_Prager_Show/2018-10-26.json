wants to payroll processing or a chart done by a company with a guy like Tom who's really of like minded patriot because you made a point about visiting with a Congressman Steve ... college who was almost killed on a baseball field in Virginia\nRight and and I think this is something if if everybody could take a moment and pause and think about the attack that happened and the baseball field in DC right or Virginia\nOr a year ago bright and how they discovered that the perpetrator was a Bernie Sanders volunteer right and he had an actual hit list in his pocket right up Republicans that he was going after literally\nAnd the way that the uh media treated that situation including you know the fact that she's going to the very fortunate man and to meet him and he's humble and grateful and\nHe does not carry you just carry a grudge rice and compared to the coverage and the attribution or blaming that's going on right now is absolutely disgusting it's insane\nI mean it's a it's a tale of two stories I mean it's all the the the hypocrisy it's like we almost forgotten that you wait and see the coverage of this not that they've arrested um and then certainly the president is going to speak or from the ... the young black leadership summit and address these comments\nBut I I promise you there if this guy is indeed there is this ban is covered with pro Trump stickers apparently and all that if you use of some some lunatic crazy person who happens to support President Trump they'll be more media coverage about\nOn the eve of the terms then there were the

today I Am so fair minded that I Do that when I come to the twin cities I take care of each twin\nWe have a truly remarkable evening last night about ... it was about seven hundred I could say that any more about that I Do know I really did see of empty seat so often you hear that but it's not literally true but I I mean they may have been but I see one\nTo all of you who came thank you and they can was a wonderful evening\nWave at Morsi of the local station and a ... am told baby the patriotism of my favorite and Larry Elder and Michael ... but it was really ah\nI I Wish there was an evening that I I I Wish every left wing or in the country could have seen what what how we talk\nJust amongst ourselves and the civility of it and the lack of hatred it would be fascinating to contrast that with a similar evening of people on the left to an audience on the left but\nI don't know how I Would do it but I Would like to talk to about a little moral leader 'cause I Want to talk a little bit about the last question was asked but in the meantime they have found a suspect\nOr they have arrested a suspect me in these uh\nI don't even know what to call them with the real bombs whatever they were sent to all these people on the left and that so far it looks like\nIt looks like the man is a a\nA coup on the right and he has a a they have his ban has banned is\nPlastered with Donald Trump stickers and the like so we will ah let's see we have even more information just coming in now he's in his fifties\nAnd let's see what else we can say arrest made in connection with mailed explosive devices white van outside plantation auto zone appears to be focused even vest the gators and if you get the pictures\nOf it or\nYou can see the the the pro Donald Trump\nStickers and people look ... ... it's conceivable the guys on the left that he wants to make believe these all the right but I I suspect that this is the real deal he's simply a he was already it's interesting he had already been arrested in the past he has a record for making terror threats\nWhy people who make terror threats are not in jail is want to\nBuy a boat rentals I don't understand why they have to actually acted out [noise] you can't threaten bats\nTerror and the like and that would be sufficient to place you are in prison I I don't know I'm a there's a question that I posing\nSo on is going to happen and it's already happening is you see we told you it's a Trump rhetoric that cause the Trump rhetoric that caused the truck prior to Donald Trump to the left and the right got along great Celeste was not calling a ... or all of us all of us all of us racist\nAnd all I I'm not ... they're not calling the police are racists\nAnd even on occasion pigs this none of this was happening guy who pay portrays the police's pigs on his socks and in in a a football game in a is a chosen by Nike to be at spokesman there this is all this is all because of Trump presumably\nA windmill Charles Murray uh one of the most thoughtful of people in the country uh it goes to speak at Middlebury College and or is it physically attacked in a woman oh the professor with him is injured by a left wing students now that's all Trump\nSee this is the amazing thing\nOnly only the rights views hate is is the lie the one of the grand lies I should make a list they have to do that for myself the grandest of the law is\nThe greatest of the lives is that America is racist the or the other number one is that we haven't word Nazis right I mean come on\nAnd and you remember how fast the steam Scalia and the the shooting at at a Republican congressman playing a baseball game Ralph fast that disappeared from the news I mean you get updates on Steve ... visas a condition and that would be it\n\nBut now this thing uh right right it before the elections I mean this guy aside from just being ... evil\nIn his in sick is stupid stupid heavy if\nIf if the left could have invented the guy they would have invented the guy if he turns out to be the right wing or is that it that it apparently he he has a say apparently because of the of the fan but as soon as I heard ... and then in ... in the beginning I thought\nThis could this could well be a guy on the left because it's so often these hoaxes to take place\nBut that is more information came in and they thought about it more than I realized who the targets for it's hard for me to imagine these these were the ideal targets of somebody who does have people on the left other all the people on the left would have picked the same targets if they were trying to blame the right\nWill find out more than I Will let you know any more information as it is revealed to the public of the United states of America [noise] so I have a very interesting thing for you here very interesting\nToday uh let's see David Brooks in the New York times who ... the New York times has three columnist author of about\nTwenty that are not on the left and David Brooks is one of them\nI there were none that are on the right\nThere are not less ... which is fine but they're they're not really on the right eye number words I don't I don't believe I Know for a fact there was not a single pro Trump Columbus the twenty twenty five columnist of the New York times felt one\nHalf the country is pro Trump and not a single columnist they could not find the human being ... I take that back reports they could find the human being they would not publish a human being who was pro Trump on the opinion page\nOr on the New York times of the New York times so but David Brooks is not is not over what you just do it I Would say just centrist enemies quite anti Trump but he wrote a piece in which she spoke about how beautiful nationalism is that he is a nationalist he's not a global is\nWhich in the New York times that gutsy thing to do of course he spoke about how Donald Trump\nOr is not a good nationalist either because otherwise it would be unacceptable to the New York Times' readership defeated also attack\nDonald Trump I'm not saying is not sincere that I'm fairly telling you that that's what happened but the article the column was a pro nationalism pieces I remember I spent some time on that it's very important the president said he's a mashable list any attack the global lists\nAnd he was last data CNN and my play the laughter I mean they actually laughed at it\nSo now I what I find even more interesting than the columns or the comments by readers so I Want to read to you sell the comments of New York times readers to New York times\nColumn ... the virtues of nationalism\nIn which he says I Love my nation you know and and it's a good thing to love your nation and my you know I I feel more for my nation than I Do for another nation just as I feel more from my family than another family\n\nAnd I want other nations to love their nation right all of which I have said very often myself so listen to some of the uh some of the letters that are written and again I'll give you updates a ... with regard to or anything in Florida here with the suspect of the bombing\nSo here number one ... the times\nPicks may have times picks there were three uh\nThree a list that's the word three lists of comments the New York times pick list the readers pick list\nAnd all so this is the times ...\nThat sounds like patriotism to me and there's a difference nationalism is historically been used to know the superiority of the nation to the detriment of other nations in the world community nationalism as arrogance and falls pride\nNationalism can blind citizen to the need for critical thinking at assessing ones country's policy\nSo you see this is this is a big issue this is really really big\n[noise]\nLast loads of nationalism ... that is one of its as fundamental\nAs the left belief in big government is to smash\nNow let me say for the record that I Love seeing black Santa clauses and Asian Santa Claus is I Love it I think it I think that is truly the spirit of Christmas\nTo see a the idea of that Santa Claus can only be white that would be that would be racist I think\nWhat is Santa Claus the ... the legend of Santa Claus coming from Europe\nAnd coming and and the you know for kids another disease from the north pole the people in the north well I guess really north I guess you might be a more of a nobody think of it a an Eskimo\nBut anyway it's an ... ... is an audit charge that if if if you hang your hat on she said Santa Claus is white\nOr\nIt doesn't strike me that that is evidence that the person thinks\nThat blacks should be mistreated or is it they are inherently inferior in some way I Would tell me I'm very I really am curious 'cause I I'm not I'm not up on my\nTriggers here that that's an interesting

important ... just three identities that I think are\nThey are necessary or they are major additives to one's happiness but they are not sufficient if this is this a low doesn't make you happy but they are great additives supplements\nContribute towards that is the word they are great contribute towards towards happiness a sexual identity male or female a national identity and a religious identity\nI think in my lifetime I have seen that these things are real contributors now the reason I warn you at the outset the trigger is that there are those and I won't even identify them 'cause it's a happy this hour on everybody to listen and everybody to be as comfortable as possible\nBut there are those who are working to\nNotify those identities and say that they they really are not real and they are not even good book that and therefore I truly truly believe they are contributing to unhappiness\nThe population by knocking these identities won a prank or Seventy seven six so that I Believe that the more comfortable you are with being a woman or being a man being a boy or being a girl\nAnd that is that is a serious part of your identity sir I Will be totally all by a graphic here I have always been very lucky I admit it always been comfortable with being mail I've never wants to be a female I've never thought of myself as female I Am truly comfortable and\nUh I celebrate ... to ... to whatever extent that his celebrate a boy I Am I my male identity and I want females to do the exact same thing with being female\nI think I mean I I don't know how you can debate that that is a contributor to happiness nobody would argue even the most I Would think\nOf the most ardent defender of the transgender and I'm not even attacking the trench is on the contrary he was not an attack at all but I I Would say that nobody would argue that having gender does for you thinking that you are as the other six\nOf them your biological given sex is not an it's not a source of happiness it may be something that you you you have to deal with and of course it's something you have to deal with\nAnd you should try to filter maximize your opportunities for happiness in life but it's you gotta really semi reality to argue that that is\nA a not an obstacle at the very least to one's happiness we're one is not comfortable being a male or being a female\nSo that's one identity I identities in fact almost been given a bad Maine\nOh he has an identity ooh that's not that's not good next is a national identity I think it contributes to one's happiness to feel part of something larger\nAnd ... and I think uh I think it's terrific I feel very American it has been a major contribution contributor to my happiness and I uh I celebrate it\nDoesn't mean I think America can do no wrong with some sort of serenity it's like saying I don't think men can do any wrong celebrating the fact that I'm a man\nOr or comfortable with the fact that I'm a man but having an identity more the more I identify as this is Mike pieces of this happiness our the more you identify with\nThe the greater your chance for happiness in third as your religious identity that is played a major role in my life in my case Judaism being Jewish\nAnd it is for Christians obviously the majority great majority that you're listening obviously you're not Jewish but it doesn't matter or whatever it might be if you're a Mormon if you're if you're Catholic if you were Protestant if you're evangelical\nOr whatever it might be what every it it could it can contribute to your happiness sometimes it contributes to misery all of them can all of them can also contribute to your misery\n... nothing is a guarantee in life\nYou can be a you can be at war with your with your religious identity some people are\n\nFrom I first started radio I was the moderator of a program on ABC in Los Angeles very very very popular show I inherited a very popular show ...\n\nI was the moderator and there's a priest a rabbi minister each week different ones each week and then they were members of fourth religion\nAnd I would get calls people would call in and I remember how many people call it was amazing to me so much so that at one time there were so many people who identify themselves to tell you how you doing this I just want to say that the priest I'm an ex Catholic or I'm a recovering Catholic and I I\nI I was amazed I was amazed at how many people still identify themselves as egg nobody called the say you know I'm an ex Protestant I'm an ex Jew [laughter] so ... that we had this this I these people were obviously at war with their identity one guy called that he was Ninety\nAnd he was still angry at the nuns who would do is apparently raptors locals with a ruler when he was when he was twelve I told them you know I Am and I'm a Catholic but it seems to me after Seventy eight years you might want to give that up\nAny way I I Know that in my life those three\nIdentities religious national and sexual have been major contributors [noise] semi mills if there is a sort of a war against those identities today and I think told it will do is decreased human happiness\nHow you found your children feel\nWell I have a one boy and he's actually the thing in Israel now and he's he's good [laughter] he he's also\n... who do you have who do you have these conflicts with\nA more of a trend more likely than friends and family find your um extended family\nWell look I I hear you I don't want to talk too much politics or happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality or what what she says is true\nSusan wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it I mean while there are many ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find ... otherwise you'd be very lonely human being\nBut if it's a challenge to find kindred spirits to that in New York City isn't that interesting I mean of course I don't know Susan but as soon as she said she celebrates being a woman being an American and being a Jew I just assumed they knew her politics but interesting\nVery interesting defining element in the ideological rift in America thank you Susan I appreciate that\nAre in

and they're supposed to your uh TV shows\nOr your radio shows and you're a you're a university and with regard to identity his name as Ethan and you wanted to talk a little bit about his identity issues that he's in college in California\nYeah that pretty much I I I grew up in\nA way of our country cargo and then I I just moved to California I Am a stay at pretty much when I'm In the classroom

very sweet image of of the two of you thank you\nLook this is again this transcends specifically the happiness issue\nBut my general approach is to clarify where we differ it comes across as extremely non aggressive totally non defensive\nBoth so you're not defending you and you're not in attacking them\nJust say listen we're you know we're both here to study and we're both students in or you know we're a good guy and so on and so what I like to do just what I like to do is I like to figure out where it is I I might differ with somebody so then you just you you could ask if a few questions\nAnd

absence of them is very detrimental to happiness people who do not have a strong identity are much more likely to be unhappy human beings\nMarshall in Minneapolis, Minnesota hello Marcia would be the apple pie Dennis how're y'all really well\nSir I'm well first off I Want to say a thank you for all that you do I'm I'm thirty six years old on married um I struggle with bipolar disorder and mental illness and addiction but I'll tell you what one of the greatest identities that has grounded me the reality is is family\nAnd that uh that has helped provide spiritual fulfillment in a way I'm In a sense sort of like Carl Sagan if you've heard of him\nI not only heard of him I actually interviewed him\nSo I I I often cite our interview he I had a TV show for a very short period of time in the nineties he was one of the cast and I'll never forget he said Dennis I just want you to know why I look up\nTo the stars I don't know if you said heaven's but with the heavens and\nThe more I Know when the more I see the more I realized how insignificant we are\n[laughter] am I about I remember I was you know I I certainly enjoyed immensely but I I remember\nI think I think I even said I I uh you know professor Sagan or doctor saying I don't I don't quite understand why that's an uplifting thought due the use AK\n... in a sense I my degree in a strongly and it's it's not easy on the scale of universe Mary in a way in significant but so are our citizens\nAnd we can in a set in a way but we can look forward to it is a significant tendency lack of meaning you're free to make our own\nAnd what we do with our lives as humans\nYou know but we don't let me just respond you're ... you're right people have to make up a meeting or they'll go out of their minds we need meaning more than anything but food so I understand that but you acknowledge\nThat very statement you made that you made up your meaning that one doesn't actually exist therefore\n\nNo I wouldn't say that we don't exist but in these\nNano and say we don't exist I said you meaning me literally ... meaning doesn't exist all like you you make it up\nThere is no self evident meaning in the universe we create our own\nRight okay so if we created and this is not an attack in any way I just wanted to clarify for you [noise]\nIf whatever we make up we made up if I if I make up something then like knowledge it doesn't really exist I have made it up and it's true meaning doesn't really exist if there is no creator than than creation has no meaning\n\nNow I never thought that there was a period in my life or I'd I'd make it useful words St reckon myself it not stick not agnostic ... where you don't\nGet any entertained\nThat shouldn't have the creativity 'cause the creator and he's not fighting ended up going a little older after graduating College of becoming more something more of an ... and ... sciences is not anything denying the more steady in his creation such that in mind about well\nOr at least that's a big advantage he okay listen and that's\nA big advance I thank you for the call I nothing that Zach said contradicts what I've said I won't use that to understand that\nThat was ever happiness you derive from simply being human would be a miserably added to by other identities national religious and I'm sure you have an identity as a man so but I'm sure that that's a that's a factor too [noise]\nAll righty and all this interesting take down in Los Angeles thank you for calling a\nThank you for taking my call I wanted to talk about the paradox of the fact that as a police

all went way way way problem no no no that's like no no no that's not possible because she her her's is all female\nYou ... it would it would be to go on\nIt indicates that I identify as a female\nRight All right but why I'm just curious why isn't she or her\nEnough well I Would just it's because it's just always\nOh I'm fine okay I get it so the other so I Would do he a\nHis and he is

it's ... it's very painful\nOr that this is a hit the business\nIs your is your employer a particularly a political\n[noise] ah I think so the the main reason is because we work with some nonprofits where this feels\nSo therefore what common it is nonprofit yeah common\nWell to say it's a sad day for America that this has become a normative\nWhat can I say this is the first I've heard that this is I Know it's it you see this is what this is what happens\nThe universities come up with these uh destructive notions that there really is there is no such thing as male female you just you make it up it's made up it's assigned at birth this is the new thing the New York times actually rights that we assigned sex at birth\nMind boggling like nature has signed\nMajor resigned whether you're gay or straight but it doesn't assign whether you're male or female and they say that they are pro science\nAll right Diane I have learned from the ah John I asked John to call back from Illinois from the first hour because he doesn't agree with me you can go um\n[noise] okay yeah I Hope I Hope we hope I can express myself and we don't interrupt each other I didn't call to yell at you or anything\nLike no no I Know that I only interrupted you because you made a point there were so dishonest and I'm not saying you did it deliberately that I have to stop you because otherwise I Would have let it go you compared antifa\nTo the Nazis of the past instead of the Nazis of the president\n... ... is the most violent group in America today it's not the most violent group in the world in history go ahead\nOkay well maybe we can touch on that as well but uh I I look at a series of events that I reach a conclusion I Know you reach a different conclusion but here's here's what I'm saying and I want to know what you think\nUh in May of last year\nA racist to pledge to support that Donald Trump and adjust to just attended a a big a right wing rally murdered two men on a commuter train when he was\nBeing confronted him when he was talking to Muslim women then in August of last year\nA self identified neo Nazi also a Trump supporter in Charlottesville, Virginia killed a resident of Charlottesville, Virginia have their hair she was not a member of anti thought she was part of the majority of people opposing the neo Nazis who were simply residents of that town or students or parts of religious groups that are coming to stand up\nTo the organized racist or I see the president celebrating and endorsing violence against a journalist in Montana\nListen to his antagonistic rhetoric towards his enemies and now we have what appears to be a right wing supporter of the presidents president engaging in a massive assassination effort against those anti antagonistic a critic for the president and I hear you say that ... is the biggest threat and the liberal mobs\nNo no I don't know the ... and I said the ...\nSay the left is I ... the deepest part of the left I'll probably tell you okay I heard what you said now can I respond or do you want more say more\nIf I can just finished my thought I was gonna say I also hear it and while this Barbie bombings were going on I heard a lot of people in your line of work\nI'm Sorry well ... what bombing in yeah sorry if so what what what bombings\nThe the all the mail bombs that\nWell okay that they're not bombing as you have to be precise John nothing bombed okay so there were no bombings the tractor statement bombings okay\nI'm Sorry if I saw something that confusing you didn't\nKnow what I Do know no no no you're dishonest you ... I'm Sorry to say this or you can confuse me do you live there were no bombings John\nThey won the bottom is that accurate or inaccurate but you're confused me or were you an accurate answer me a boy and confuses me why are you an accurate during that on I didn't filibuster you spoke the whole time you're\nVery lucky though to nobody laughs at me by by okay John's or John is dishonest and it's painful for me to say I asked\nAmong again I gave them plenty of time there were no bombings and then he said he confused me\nCan you play with language my friend the left is a far greater threat of violence in this country there were a right wing despicable human beings who do despicable things there were a left wing despicable human beings\nBut let me let me show every one of my friends I Will be speaking at Colorado State university next week I Will need I Will need security no less just need to security at a at a university that's a far larger issue than one crock pot here or one crock pot there\nNobody has a monopoly on crackpots but the left has a far greater dominance of violence of shutting up people they don't agree with\nIt is extremely difficult to enter a campus with a conservative fought it is effortless to enter with a left the sport I don't know what country this man lives in but it isn't the same as the one I Do\nOkay\nAnd let's go to Alice in South gate California Hi Alice Dennis Prager\nHi Hi Dennis thank you for taking my call thank you and I want to thank you for being a good moral um subject in my life I've been thinking for thirty six years I started lifting key on religion on the line with my husband ...\nThat's not you so you started in your patties in your twenties [laughter] yeah I Know I started\nIn my team [laughter] I mean as well that was nice but they soon sixteen Seventeen years old we will continue in Glendale hoping to meet you in that we were unable to on that day\nWell I Hope we do we can very touch thank you for your call means a lot to me we shall return momentarily\nAnd but you I Will remind you are listening to the dentist pretty good show\nAre there things there are mistakes that I made certainly there were things I was not aware of but uh I think you're absolutely correct on that on that issue it doesn't alleviate everything but it does go a long long ways to help them deal with what is\nNothing but a I mean almost all the time a bad situation for the kids there are certainly exceptions\nYeah we don't bill are not in the lab usually harmless\nAnd yeah you're very thoughtful man and I appreciate it\nBut I think we're substantial agreement look life is filled a whiz obstacles to happiness and filled with the land mines and that is how we navigate our life that ultimately determines our ability to handle that hopefully with some degree of happiness\nI\nHave a lot of a lot of lot of folks on divorce or should I haven't talked about in quite some time I talked about a much more in the past I Will address a began types of this call\nBut he and I both agree that the issue is what you do after the divorce more than the divorce I mean many things are factors including what age you you divorced what trial the child's age\nIt's very different if the child was too that if the child was twelve or the child was twenty two\nThat's that's it and say there's no comparison in fact\nBut\nBut the the most calamitous results I've seen or when a parent the parent the parent ties as the other parent deal legitimize as the other most children are attached to both parents\nAnd even if you are right\nCertain you're right the legitimizing of the other parents and in all but the most most egregious\nCases this is a sin against against the child against your family uh\nHow're you doing there yeah All right I won't I won't call because we're gonna take a break in a moment\nI think that\nPeople just need to understand very few lives are smoothed including confirm intact parents how many people\nAre at the psychiatrists and psychologists parents never divorced but not to say that all things being equal that's the ideal of course the ideal\nShall return and the moment I'm Dennis
