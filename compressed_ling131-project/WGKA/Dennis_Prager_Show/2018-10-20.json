briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree\nOf seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on the U.S to try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nAll right now does that impact for example the war in Yemen and this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses in Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America\nTrying to confront these were sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have

lawsuit on behalf of the chief the good news is a is that we argue that the policy they actually required prior permission so they told the cheap\nAfterward that oh no you can't write a book on your own time for a Bible study unless you get prior permission from the ... and the city allows you to do so we challenge that as being unconstitutional he's only five permission needed is the first amendment and the judge ruled with us\nI'm so that the judge ruled in favor of the cheap and now we're going to trial or to figure out where the case goes for there and and how much damage as for the chief\n... that's a terrific so this is all still pending but\nAgain I just want to remind people that right now for the rest of this week um if you give a hundred dollars to alliance defending freedom to help fight for cheap Cochran in for clients just like him who are defending their own religious liberty and defending your religious liberties either a hundred dollars is going to be doubled\nBecause that's what she was she was a scum bags for governor and the fact that South Carolina and other Republicans across the country love Nikki Haley is an example of how people get bought into the ether as a candidate\nWho snow jobs you they trick you they ... they screw you over the local candidates\nAre such a Stacey Abrams and I don't know that this is the case I've heard a lot of good things about Stacey Abrams may even Republican operatives in the in the in the DOMA dummies the gold dome downtown I I've heard people say listen they she's she's a burst of reach across the aisles gets things done she worked with people she's a good\nGood person and I try to take that on face value throughout this election season\nBut what I'm beginning to notice is a bit of Nikki Haley complex which is not that she just won't talk to Brian or a a nine to one of the answers he won't talk to anyone they'll say well she did Erick Erickson over on the ws be back in um\nIn January well that was before the race really mattered that was at a time where you are trying to get through the primary\nAnd it wasn't a big deal if you had a bad showing with Erick Erickson at that point now it's a big deal if you talk to a conservative hosting it tripped up on big issues you're trying to kind of\nA walk back like gun control and immigration and things like that but I Do notice Stacey Abrams is real quick to go on CNN and MSNBC and that's what Nikki Haley did\nThe the conservative equivalent of CNN and MSNBC\nWas Fox News is Fox News and Nikki Haley was always on Fox News that's why so many conservatives or Republicans see her as a shining star of Republican in geopolitics because she would always go on Fox News and she would talk about non state issues for which she virtually had no experience and she would\nShe would play a political act\nAnd say what she thought the audience wanted her to say whether she believes that are not as irrelevant she would say what the audience agrees with\nAnd the cost the state issues in South Carolina at the time\nWere not important to the broader audience on Fox News she would get away without being challenged about the kids dying\nUnder her department of social services kids that had been rescued from families and they returned back to families the drunkard jihad as a department of transportation administrator when we had the worst ice storm in South Carolina and virtually history in the state in the lower part of the state and on and on and on things for the people she put in places of power in her government\nWere failing miserably including killing people\nLiterally and you're talking about Democrats stand up there and do Republicans healthcare plans going to kill people\nLiterally people were dying and the state of South Carolina because of the incompetence ease of Nikki Haley how do you get away with it well you have no media and a small state like South Carolina\nAnd you go onto the national Fox News media and talk about big level issues where it's easy for governor to sound really powerful and conservative\nThat is what she did she got away with it and she got reelected and then she bash the Trump\nShe was never Trump or virtually during the election and then in order to keep your friends close and your enemies Haley closer he put her in a position that would put her off on the side give her some national attention allow her to shift the shining star right I see this going on to some extent with our gubernatorial election here in Georgia\nWith Stacey Abrams a Democrat\nIt's not uncommon that a Democrat refuses to go on a conservative leaning talk radio station like this one but it is ridiculous that we would elect someone who will not talk to both sides of the aisle equally\nIn terms of the political pundit tree that's out there\nThe year that Nikki Haley ran for reelection in South Carolina the Democrat came on my show six times her opponent now he had no shot at winning\nI knew that he had she had no shot at getting my vote I Would be as insanely never Haley\nAs the never Trump ers were if Nikki Haley ever were the nominee or perhaps even the vice presidential nominee for the president of the United states because I Know intimately what a crook and they cheat she is period\nThat said I despise everyone on both sides of the aisle who participate in this sort of ether politics\nWhich is I put the ether on on the big national broad level I issues where there's no chance for debate or or dissent and anything that is about my record where I get into local issues were really matters to people like you and me\nI run and that I think is what Stacey Abrams is playing here I I I\nDislike Stacey Abrams I think she's one of the better Democrat candidates in terms\nOf what she could bring in terms of unity to the state but I Do dislike two or three of her issues vehemently those being immigration positions I don't trust her on immigration I think she's more of a sanctuary city or sanctuary state type of gubernatorial candidate\nAlthough she seems to be walking that back I definitely think she's not the right kind of candidate for guns and my position on guns as the same as libertarians lead my guns that hell alone period it's a Second Amendment right it will not\nBe it will not be infringed\nAnd that is a kind of language as I Do not believe it's open for any political candidate or elected official to interpret and I think when you start stepping on those lines that makes me question where will you be on the other issues now let's get into Brian camp\nLet's talk about some of the issues with Brian Kemp but I saw in the interview that I think are um I don't know concerning\nI like governor deal I think he's done a pretty good job I hear many people say he's been crooked maybe as I have no evidence of that I've met the man I interviewed governor deal a couple of times ah at events of the last time in the Republican National convention he's a warm individually strikes me as sincere and well meaning\nAnd of course you know a lot of the past the hill is paid with good intentions but I think it goes beyond that will governor deal I think he means well I think he's managed well and I think he's done great for the state in terms of economic development I'm impressed by governor deal working well with the biggest mayor in the state\nMayor Reed whether you like them or not and I was impressed by mayor Reed humbling himself to work with a with Governor deal those are the kinds of examples I think that Georgia has been a shining example for over the last few years\nI'm not sure if Brian Kemp can come in with that same approach\nOr he tacked far to the right of after being a John ... supporter in the election I Can't get past that I I Can't understand how you can support a sanctimonious better than Dallas self righteous mug arrogant\nI I guess I run out of words that I can use legally on the air after that individual governor like governor John ... Ohio and then tack over to Trump and be such a ... I'm a Trump supporter I I don't understand that\nThere is a great concern in this state about the fact that Brian Kemp was the pick of the Purdue family and that the Purdue family Sonny Purdue specifically are a cabinet member for agriculture under the Trump Administration went to Trump which he has close access no problem with that and said Trump please get behind him help and when\nWhich ... seems like there will be a lot of pay back now I like the produce I'm not like everybody else in the state I've had I've had senator Purdue on the show I've talked with people off and on I I think by and large he's got the right position on a lot of issues and\nA lot of what really chastise as the Purdue family is they're deeply rooted Kennedy esque or Clinton ask a roots into politics here in Georgia and I know that's concerning to everyone including people like me but when it comes to the actual votes\nAnd the support of what the American people put forth as their desires of twenty sixteen senator produce Sonny Perdue the produce family I think it's been behind that I think they have a represented the interests of Georgia when they depart from that then I'll start to have a real problem with\nThe the way they perhaps remain in power in the state in such deep level but at this point they seem to have the right positions that I think move this country forward I Am however concerned when we get into political dynasties which the Purdue family are in contact the Georgia politics both at the federal and the state level\nAnd that they are the ones really directing who gets picked because that's what happened with Brian Kemp let's face it Casey Cagle was the lead candidate\nAnd Julie got an end run from the Purdue family whatever reason you know whether it be a a spilled milk there they're all crying over whatever we'll we'll\nContinue this minimum and I'll tell you what all that means as we continue don't go away one hour special about the politics of Georgia twenty I miss her [noise]\n[noise]\nI recently last four hours a week on my lap cat in St Kathleen manifest showers and they got a cat and [noise] I got\nTo change and how they have to find out if they can make social ... any time you\nKnow I think I Need to have twenty five I think if I had already made here I got to have all these shows and how do you need to eat out aligned [noise]\nIn the in the counties in the in the federal government is we don't enforce our laws anymore we don't enforce the spirit of our laws sometimes the law says the prosecution of this particular crime or activity doesn't make sense because we may not be able to prove it in a court that's not the case\nSometimes the prosecution of something that is a direct violation\nOf the spirit of the law is enough to deter others from doing it because the prosecution and defense is so expensive\nFor instance in the financial crimes that led to the great recession had they prosecuted more of those people who packaged up those loans and lived to investors that they were AAA status when they were really junk bonds\nEven though they might not have won the victories it would've been a financial burden on those people to prove enough that it would have been more of a deterrent than what we are now which is just pay a fine or pay nothing and get away with it so sometimes pressuring through the spirit of our laws without political intention is important\nWhat has happened under him and I asked him this question he gave an underwhelming answer\nI asked him about the the fact that one point seven million dollars was in the budget when he took off as a secretary of state for regulators and and investigators really to police the licenses that his secretary of state office overseas in our state\nAnd it's now seven hundred thousand dollars according to my research so that's one million dollar dropped more than half of the budget has been eliminated he says well he inherited\nA skyrocketing leases that were inappropriate for the secretary of state's office I'll buy that argument and also because of the financial crash and the lowering of revenue in tax revenue state of Georgia that the legislator cut him down and cut him off and he had to cut everywhere and he had some of the biggest cut from the state I'll buy that argument it still doesn't answer my question\nAs to how you can be an office that regulates the licenses and the state and cut a dime out of that one it's already short\nBecause that is the fundamental role in some cases of the secretary of state's office says the way George is set up to make sure that contractors aren't crooked to make sure that developers aren't crickets and make sure that people holding licenses under the ... the secretary state are following the laws no one's policing that right now\nWe have a wild wild west in Georgia and it's gotten worse and worse over the last eight years under secretary of state Brian Kemp now this doesn't mean you shouldn't vote for him\nThis is me this is a huge brick wall for me to climb personally\nAnd the he he did not answered the question as to how the citizen was made to make this size of a cut in that important of all role and I want to pick up on that next because I think that's the real issue as to why I say we don't have a choice for governor and how about this libertarian\nHe had all the right position

Saturday that uh eight AM\nAnd on a ... eleven Ninety or sister station at ten o'clock on Sundays I'm continuing about our interviews with Ted met the libertarian and uh with\nBrian Kemp the Republican we as you probably heard if you've heard part of this hour did not get Stacey Abrams to come on the program yet\nUm but we've been sharing will threaten some more about just the general issues that we're facing in this election in the head Mets interview we got into detail in the last few minutes and I want to play that for you again in case you missed that Ted measures the libertarian\nI'm pulling it about two percent right now it's not a big chance he's going to win I'm going to share the poll numbers as of the latest with you in the governor's race\nOr here in Georgia in just a moment but I Want to play what Ted Mets and I talked about the libertarian in regards to amendments to the state constitution that you will be voting on and they're very confusing and they're all trickery in my view you probably should vote no that's my opinion\nAnd I'll tell you why after I play the part where we discuss these kind of rapid fire succession go\nWe have five amendments to the state constitution or on the ballot this November you're concerned about these you think we should vote no on all of them\nAbsolutely voting on much at all of them expand the power of the government to invade and encroach on our constitutionally the numerous did manage ruled right\nLet's start with business courts they want to point they or they are just not elect a\nNew separate classes citizens known as businesses\nAnd Everytime they created a new classes fitness is in bad taste rights away from everyone else\nEssentially what the business court system is gonna be it's gonna be a parallel or system new judges new offices new facilities and why so they can prosecute more more businesses for not having a life or something like that\nBut the bottom line on and do all of the judges are going to be appointed by the governor there not elected they're appointed which means they search for life in which means that if the governor has a problem with a particular type of business he can forces judges do\nNot follow the law but follow some sort of a policy [noise]\nThe uh amendment one for the outdoor recreation equipment sales are ridiculous\nBecause it says that the recreation is it creates um\nIf you're a sporting goods store ...\nPart of your taxes from from sales taxes are going to go to outdoor projects which I think it's fine but the thing is not

but today's politics we're talking about the interviews that we've been doing here on a a nine twenty to answer the mid term elections and specifically the gubernatorial race last segment talking about the\nThe\nAmendments to the constitution state of Georgia that are up a there's a four or five of them\nAnd download knowing all of them because they are just when you see these amendments on your ballot\nJust interpret them as do you want to expand government control of your lives and their out region tentacles into business in Georgia yes or no and most people within the sound of this microphone would say the government know probably ...\nOr as to the whole this is always interesting Georgia has been the tourists for the last few years of being really not a state you can hold and I I think the reason for this is a lot of the polling it's still done\nWith landlines and I I I think you you almost have an age skewing and landlines or you have people who have landlines because they give it to you\nLike I was talking to my dad about this not long ago and he said you know the only reason I've got this land line is because they give it to me for free and I said you know why they give you the landline for free ride because\nThat gives them something they can sell they make more money selling the data about your phone number in your household from say Comcast where they give you\nA cheaper rate to have a landline and Internet and cable than just the Internet and cable it's actually cheaper to have the triple bundle than it is that the double in many cases so they do that 'cause they're selling your data that's why the thing rings all the time even though you don't answer it\nSo the people who answered the phone and I'm not I'm not bashing anybody here but the people who answer the landline and have a little less to do in life\nAnd that doesn't make them any less relevant or any less intelligent but they're more likely to be retired and so when you look at that situation\n[noise] um you're not going to get a good snapshot of the people that are actually going to show up and vote now there are more likely voters who have a landline I Would I Would maintain\nThat isn't necessarily mean they're the ones that are going to vote nor do they represent the voting population you got the millennials the next generation now voting you got the uh the ... and the baby boomers and beyond that's the biggest class of voting population\nUm\nAnd what's really hard to do with Gen x ers and with millennials we as a group I'm a Gen x her but I say we millennials in Gen actors have something similar income and we've grown up with an increasingly bureaucratic government over regulated\nGovernment in control of everything's in our bedroom in our lives telling us what to do we know better\nAnd foundational a Reagan always said when the government says they're here to help you know that's a good sign right that really sticks with me that's ingrained I think in the millennial and especially the gym next generations so the idea that we\nAre going to be a Democrat or Republican that we are likely are unlikely devote ... you don't know\nI I'm politically engaged them on the radio so I'm I'm going to vote but I'm never going to tell anyone\nWho caused me on the phone exactly what I'm going to do I'm not going to tip my hand it's sort of like in real estate business I had somebody that's we go I don't see a profile on you on some other ... some site I didn't even really know about I've heard of it\nAnd I said well you know other than Zillow in Chile or you're not going to find a profile about me on too many websites because I'm not giving my information to third party referral companies so that when someone searches for my business\nThat's whose data shows up when I put my data to get my business free exposure as they say er my name free exposure I buy my own exposure I don't need help with that maybe\nI'm different because I'm In the media and I understand media and marketing but\nYou know when we do that we give access away I don't want to give access I don't want to give the data what I have in my brain about me specifically is incredibly valuable what you have in your brain about you specifically as a voter as a consumer as a business person who strongly valuable\nThe more that you give the more someone is selling the data about due\nTo somebody else in order to try to snow job you or mislead Jew or persuade you into something or manipulate you\nStop giving your data anymore and I say that in a business that I Am I Am in desperate need of your data\nI'm In desperate need of your dad and my business but see this is the ... the problem with the polling there's enough people out there like me that will vote for someone and I would say that I made undecided decided voter or decided undecided voter I'm probably going to vote for him\nBut I don't know for sure\nI mean he has a chance to tick me off and Stacey Abrams has a chance to backtrack on everything and make me consider it I I don't know what I'll do it might write my own name in\nI'm not in ... by the candidates but I Do think at the end of the day I Will make a decision based upon who most aligns with my values and most people here me vacillating and thinking about this back and forth go while you're going to vote for camp I'd I'd maybe I don't know\nWhat's on my job to tell you to vote for on the show I'm just analyzing stuff what I can tell you is the polling however is so skewed now the polls are not being used to reflect what's actually happening in the race by taking them on face value they're being used to manipulate you\nAnd it's our own data it's like real estate agents when we gave all of our data at a realtor dot com into Zillow we gave away the most valuable thing we have\nAnd now they sell our data back to us so when you as a voter or consumer give your data to a surveying company or a third party without being compensated for it you have just given away something extremely valuable\nMany people know this ordinarily by our nature we're just curmudgeon now we don't want to give it to them because we don't want you to know none of your dang business right so the data of polling is the science of polling has ... incredibly flawed I wanted to set this up so with that\nGeorgia governor Kim versus Abramson let's just say that's what it is there could be a spoiler alert irritated and match the libertarian\nHas about two percent in these polls um\nIf he gets to I is it ten or twenty\nI I don't know the number but if he got some significant number that would win credence and momentum and fund raising capability to the Libertarian Party in a statewide election which would give them the opportunity on the next go around to hit the threshold necessary don't even have to get anywhere near the\nKnocking on the door of winning but give them the threshold necessary for the Libertarian Party to be taken into the serious consideration\nAh and all facets of getting on the ballots for everything across the state of Georgia that's the real problem now they don't have a guaranteed access they can't get in as as Ted told us to the local smaller races\nYou know they can't get in and and and prove their work in the state house or they can get in prove their worth and a small towns mayor race they can't do that libertarians can't do that\nThe reason they can't do it is they have to have a big showing in a statewide race which is nearly impossible because they can't raise enough funds to break through the big money flowing into the two party system it's one of the most law parts of our government right now and it's one of the reasons we're being manipulated into oblivion in some cases so the latest\nPolls um there was one out that was conducted on ten once in a snapshot poll I think this was for W. S. B. T. V. and put him up camp up by two\nIt was about two weeks old now well over two weeks three weeks almost the AJC did a poll that surveyed over a a ten day period\nUh putting camp up by two as well W. or ex I which is eleven alive they did another poll ten three to ten eight so about a week and a half two weeks ago put camp up by too so the real clear politics average has camp up by two\nLovers of the lead everyone out there to radio land welcome back to another exciting edition of talk radio today broadcasting live in North Carolina for the smoke in North Carolina\nIt is so great to be here the donuts are flow in the coffee is foreign and I've already got a whiskey how can you go wrong with that and you're you're Mike is the only one on I Know that's how it goes next year or so and I control the bike so\nThat's what I Do I Want to do my love of course Paul the producer ladies and gentlemen it is\nA the hospitality here in North Carolina is on match I think from anywhere we bet I love it when I have to go north to get to the south and\nSouthern hospitality edits ... it's going to be a wonderful show live as we're sitting here smoking cigars and joined ourselves already this morning I got a lot of great stuff going on at relating Smith junior will be here he's got a lot of fun stories an interesting guy is with the various ... uh\nWas the basis for gene ... character and we're going to talk about that yeah I mean for a movie on the line some stories yeah Oh absolutely it's going to be a very great show also clearly marked live journal cigars will be able to ... got a lot of talk to her about\nAnd you know it's funny I ... and when we were posted on social media that currently and we'll talk to her about this but when we were posted on social media ... coming in\nI we got a lot of messages from people in the industry and saying oh we love her we love our wait till the meter it's yeah it would be able to say that it's all the tolerance and all of it was good ... we'll talk and talk about where there was nothing going bad and this and the guy sitting next to you of course are longtime\nConfidant and the man who keeps us informed on what's happening in the world of cigars Mr William Cooper himself ... hey guys welcome to North Carolina Thank you it is a pleasure to be here I Love to go through the Carolinas it's\nGreat to have you guys here has coup said if you're going to be in my state I'm showing up so he is here\nHe is driven all the way over from Charlotte to be here the every day that are just to south west of Raleigh area is great to be beautiful in order to state yeah absolutely of course AJ joined us to take care of all of our social media needs\nSmokes in the house what's up everybody thanks for having us ...
