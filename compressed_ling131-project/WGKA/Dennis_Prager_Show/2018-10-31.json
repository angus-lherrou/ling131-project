know at least you might win either come to you know I think that they handled it and I think that with what we've been seeing what we think an ethic attack that kind of um it\nDoes show that there is a sit in Thailand and on radicalization and I do that because it here in our country\nAnd so any what blood boil it down there so you would agree with the thesis that he that he offered that white men are the biggest terrorist threat in the United states\nYeah because I think that yes\nYou do let me let me bully down some numbers offer you a the police have so much more according to have the right Donald who studies this really religiously 'em in twenty Fifteen a bull a police officer in America was Eighteen point five times more likely to be killed by a black male\nBut an unarmed black male was to be killed by a police officer black males have made up forty two percent of all cop killers over the last decade\nEven though that's the blacks make up about six percent of our population Lisa\nDo you realize how awful the black on black crime and violence is in America and cities like Chicago yes even Dallas do you know how how many crimes are committed disproportionately by\nBlacks would you expect me to say black men are the biggest terrorist threat in this country was of course I wouldn't say all\nRight but okay so you want to say that and I I think the reason why eat\nYour numbers don't need anything and the reason why you can't say that the biggest threat is because Harry and perpetuating certain ideology and in this case we see that white males are perpetuating the

wants to Jews exterminated a guy who hangs out with that scene waters and block Obama\n... well I don't see what they have to deal with this discussion\nWith this I got you and your defending a ridiculous assertion that white males are the biggest terrorist threat in this country Louis Farrakhan I mean we saw Lebanon Jews slaughtered\nFor their fate this past Saturday So worst anti Semitic attacks on the Jewish community we've ever had in America Louis Farrakhan is a darling of the left and Democrats Louis Farrakhan said I'm not anti Semite I Am I'm Angie term I\nYou know what you do to

world's primary providers of it with the vigor I'm effectiveness not seen at least since ... Patrick Moynihan Trump appointee Ken Marcus head of the department of education office of civil rights has devoted much of his career to fighting anti Semitism\nThose who wish to blame Trump have an ace in the whole\nAn Anti Defamation league study that purports to show I'm almost sixty percent increase in anti Semitic incidents between twenty sixteen twenty seven team which is implicitly blamed on Trump this study has been cited over and over in response to push to Pittsburgh\nThere were several problems was relying on this study for Trump bashing however the first is that the study includes one hundred and Ninety three incidents of bomb threats to the Jewish institutions as anti Semitic incidents even though by the time ... published the study it had been conclusively shown\nThat the two perpetrators of the bomb threats were not motivated by anti Semitism\nI'll tell you and I told you this many times about Ninety percent of those bomb threats to the Jewish community centers were Coleman by an American Jewish kid with mental problems living in Israel you have a ... percent were black radical\n... and yet the a deal as he writes one can only guess why the ... chose to inflate it statistics in this way\nBut none of the explanations speak well of the ideal second ... port itself acknowledges\nThat some of the rise of incidents may simply be due to better reporting quote more people are reporting incidents to a deal than ever before unquote third quote college campuses saw total of two hundred and four incidents and twenty Seventeen compared to one hundred and eight and twenty sixteen unquote\nHe continues to right professor Bernstein how many of those incidents emanating from traditional forms of anti Semitism that one might associate with Trump being populism and how many from leftist pro Palestinian sources the a deal doesn't say\n\nYou ... I Hope you you're following this point it's rather important oh look at all this increase of anti Semitism on the Trump and then cited doubling of incidents of anti Semitism on college campuses Ninety nine percent of which are probably induced by the left and by Muslim students\n\nFor the ... big idea was incidents as anti Semitic incidence so long as they were reporters such for example the report states quote Jewish graves or cemeteries were desecrated seven times in twenty Seventeen\nThe desecration of Jewish headstones is a classic anti Semitic acts employed for hundreds of years the majority of the cemetery desecration occurred in the first months of the year at the same time as the bomb threats were cold is a Jewish institutions which contributed to a sense that the Jewish American community was under siege\nUnquote after say a Jew American Jew or have not felt under siege ...\nYou know hey I'm a conservative so I think differently which is true I Do I think differently is correct cult clearly the problem is the desecration sub cemeteries of all faiths is not uncommon and\nAre often the product of either bored teenagers or vigorous in fact at least some of the cemetery incidents counted by the ACL were ultimately determined by police not to be anti Semitic in origin the desecration of a cemetery in St Louis gotta particularly large amount of attention\nThe police eventually caught the perpetrator and determined that he was just mad and drunk not anti Semitic\nThe deal is not updated the study or press released to release to reflect some facts\nOther questionable quote anti Semitic unquote incidents I've seen reported include graffiti with a swastika\nAnd Trump in quotes is the author supporting Trump the Nazi or attacking Trump by using him being a Nazi\nMy inclination would in most cases to be the suspect the latter but surely it's at least unclear none of which is to say that we can move out of a surge but the eight deal study every one relying on to prove this doesn't show any such thing\nIs a very terrible thing folks this is fake news get it we are breathing in fake news\n[noise] [noise]\nThe wake of the horrific massacre in

amount of heat from the right door so there's no comparison the problem is that no sound empirical data exist that shows an increase in anti Semitism during the Trump Administration\nHow do you like that that would justify such claims while the data that does exist\nLike a much cited a study proves no such thing undoubtedly many readers are silently protesting what about the ACL statistics showing the fifty seven percent increase it anti Semitic incidents and twenty Seventeen\nA figure reported by NPR the New York times the Washington Post and many other media outlets in fact that's not what this study shows\nWait a minute you meet NPR the New York times while she postal lying no professor Bernstein that's not possible\nNot to not possible they wouldn't lie\nIn fact I saw what the study shows and despite the way it's been reported in the ab ... own press release the actual findings don't even purports to show any such thing\nMost important this study does not actually cling to count anti Semitic incidences such but rather the reporting of these events\nFirst it purports to count those incidents that had been reported to the ... by the media law enforcement and the public\nThe knowledge that some of the increased documented incidence is not an actual increase\nBut results from Cold War people reporting incidents that a deal than ever before second the report does not count only actual anti Semitic incidents but any incident that results quote in Jews perceiving themselves as being victimized due to the Jewish identity unquote\nAs a result of this method logical pick\nThe aid deals tally includes a hundred and sixty three bomb threats to make the Jewish community center ... students early twenties Seventeen even the two perpetrators will not motivated by anti Semitism\nRelated Lee twenty Seventeen so long usually high level of concern in the Jewish community over perceived threat a result of both Trump's victory and the Jaycee see called Jewish community center\nThis likely lead to an increase in ambiguous incidents being reported to the ab yells anti Semitic we know for example that one purported example of anti Semitic cemetery vandalism turned out to be just old stones toppling over from Port up keep\nThe ... deleted that one from its tally and another turn out to be the product of a drunken mad I read this to you from the other article he wrote individual with no anti Semitic content ... not delete that one from its tally\nThen of course it's the campuses right which is overwhelmingly from the left but it's even more
