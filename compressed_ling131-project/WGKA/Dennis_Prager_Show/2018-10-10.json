still read asterisk until\nI Love our Saturday and I think that that's a lot of truth in those ... now that's exactly right so so we created a fable it's called Donald drained the swamp it's about a caveman name Donald okay call the cave people are angry because they say\nThe king king lives in the middle of a swamp\nAnd he never he's totally out of touch with us he doesn't know about our concerns we can't even talk to him because the swamp people uh protect him he will only talked to people who live in the swamp what do we do so they go to Donald Donald is a kind of a famous caveman he's a builder of caves everybody wants to have built by Donald\nUh and so they go to Donald Donald can you help us\nAre they telling us that the situation is as well tomorrow you know I've got some time I'll go down to the swamp and see what's going on so we take a walk down to the swamp encounters a first swamp creature lobbyists or is\nAnd the lobbyists or says ... you don't understand you can't talk to the king the king doesn't talk to people who live outside the swamp he only has to be living side to some so if you want to live in a smart maybe we can work something out dumped has not interested I'll see you later so he goes back and tells\nThe cave people he says listen it's worse than we thought were gonna have to get drastic and he said they say what do you mean drastically\nUse as we are going to have to drain the swamp and they kind of get scared like you can't say that don't that don't say that the\nAnd he says no no no it's the only way and if you will how are you going to do what you're gonna get a swamp people angry because well you're angry aren't you and they say yes and it's just well maybe it's their turn\nSo the next day he decides I'm going to dig a trench he's a builder he knows how to do this all this tug of war and Mexico is not going to pay for it but he says we're going to build the biggest\nOr the ... trench we've ever dug until he goes by himself with a shovel down to the swamp now the swamp creatures come out one of them looks a little bit like Chuck Schumer one of them might look like Hillary Clinton\nI'm not being specific about that off as you know you yeah the artist did it for you when you look at it you can figure out who these people are but but they get angry they said we live here you're sticking\nAnd and he says well what do you live where we live you either live or where we live and they say if we don't want to live outside the swamp the people who live outside the swamp are an educated\nThey're on cultured they're deplorable\nAny understands that you know what all the needs to do is dig the trench and ignore these creatures so he starts to dig the trench and as he is taking the trench he sees that the swamp green color of the swamp is actually the color of money why\nBecause the whole swamp is money that's why the swamp creatures will not leave the swamp so he starts digging and then the biggest batter swamp creature ball shows up and he's angry the biggest better swamp creature of all is called\nThe George Soros\nAnd the Georgia sources really angry the has bags under his other than the he looks Hungarian and he looks like a billionaire but but the Georgia store is is really angry but Donald turns around and\nAll of the cave people are showing up with shovels and they say well not as angry as we are and they help him dig the trench dig the trench during this one is one of the rest of the way it would want to have to buy it for the incredible\nCredible but but at the end of the book\nThere's a true teaching moment about what is self government what does it mean for people to govern themselves with American style self government Donald rises to the occasion and he refuses to be the new king he says no no no a free people govern themselves\nAnd that is very exciting so they said he says if you're looking for president not a King I'm your caveman\nWashington gentleman
