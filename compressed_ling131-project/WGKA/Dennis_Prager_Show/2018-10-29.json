I think it's obvious [noise]\nAh so that's why I say boy could behaviors or to find them bad behaviors or outlawed or prohibited by a God that you have to answer to [noise] so what are we had we had fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers and sons and daughters they did not come home Saturday\nYou know you you are you go to a synagogue and you think you have some sanctuary to use that phrase\nAnd and what was his two brothers I mean ... I Can't even watch or listen to the details 'cause it's too depressing and a lot of them older right it it's just that you know they go about their business they don't bother anybody else and purely because of their religion\nThey are murdered by an evil guy who made it very clear right these anti Semitic in all Jews should be\nKilled I guess is what he's you know I'm paraphrasing what was going on\nPurely because I I think if he's upset because they were uh you know part of a group that was helping immigrants come into this country even illegal immigrants and you'll hear my position I'm sure during the day about illegal immigration one can be outraged about politics\nAnd not do what antifa does not do what the pipe bomb or does whatever side he wants to being on it it looks like he was on the you know the other side but who knows it doesn't matter evil is evil matter what you want to say\nBut it's hard to imagine the pain of at all but ... I Will you know the difference Dennis ... leave religious discussion for him when he when he gets back\nNo one's better than Dennis on that in my opinion\nBut I sure hope that there is good God waiting for them\nAnd that family members can find some solace that way I Want to know your thoughts at one a Prager seven seven six but the worst part is probably not the worst part worst part is what happened to these people but I mean and I don't mind issue here\nIs what the media and others have tried to do to blame Donald Trump\nThat his uh his the atmosphere that he has not only accepted but uh you know in some way encourage\nHas led to evil as if is first of all as if it's only on our side right they conveniently forget Steve sleeves\nAnd and that the guy there it was a Bernie Sanders supporter as I remember and he he committed total mayhem right if not for the Capitol police that happened to be there when some of the congressmen he would have wiped them all out let alone Steve's police who\nYou know almost succumb to his injuries\nBut to to and I saw it all over the place that was a a\nFormer Obama official interviewed on Fox News let alone to the guy didn't even challenge from the news host on the weekend didn't even challenged him when he said oh you know comes from the top down and the kinds of things he says and it kind of things he encourages his supporters to do that's why we have this kind of\nWhat's been going on for ever\nNot to mention that and and you certainly uh you can't just blame the president for any particular supporter of his that convinced me whether it's a pipe bomber or in fact this guy I think winds up being anti Trump my right he's ... he's on the other side it doesn't matter\nThere have to get the president at every turn whatever he does is got to be bad\nAnd it's part of the you know he he's the worst president never should have been elected uh he's evil he's a bumbling fools all those characterizations they hate him with a passion ... everything that happens in this country that is bad\nIs President Trump's fault and everything that happens that is good that's president bombs credit to his credit if you don't believe that just asking they'll tell you that [noise] so this is what we have going on it you you can't avoid politics even in something so awful here and even some of the rabbis there was a march\nIn my neck of the woods and um\nThe San Fernando valley and you could just hear at all which is the spirit of the country and its encourage myth of this kind of thing from the even if they didn't say his name you know who they were talking about and I know what happened I bet you're all of you out there and knew that it would happen that one way or another they were going to blame him for anything that happened\nIncluding people who are against him none of it matters and we'll get into this later I I think in this first I Want to talk about the media and the press\nOh what they've done to this present butter relates here relates here to these family members um that will never come home again because of\nAnti Semitism um look this is the greatest country in the history of the world but there are going to be evil people in it they're all going to be crazy people there are going to be this is what I say a to blacks or say there's a you know\nHatred and bigotry against them and uh the racism in this country yeah you you can't outlawed you can't get rid of it totally they're always going to be people like that\nAnd there's nothing you can do it just it ... and here's the other thing in this horrible incident luck luck plays a a a lot in life that if the you know I think some there's always someone who doesn't go for some reason and then they have to think the rest of their lives why wasn't of my time [noise]\nSo it it it's very difficult as I said and you can imagine what these family members of going through\nUm ... it and it's not just them as the remember the black church\nWhere the guy comes and whatever his name was any they just kill people because they're black which is meaningless being black tells you nothing about someone\nOr being Jewish tells you nothing about their values and who they are being Christian right Christians are under attack in this country that's the one group that it seems to be okay you can attack them you can get away with it right 'cause it's okay in this country\nIs it's very depressing and that's an ... leaves me back to the topic that's why they hate President Trump so much because he's willing to stand up for a stand up for our values\nAnd we've now found out through the corruption at the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for her actions and the cries to lock her up represent the outrage that people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair was an intern so because of sex that's why people want to go jail no he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that this one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so lock her up is not by any means and incitement to violence the other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially in order to what the charge that they are the enemy that people\nThey'd be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and they're beyond offended but it's also legitimate\nThe press not infrequently comes out was stores that are not true the latest example did you hear this one NBC was hiding spoke tore evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's it's a cute one it's a good what it seems NBC knew that she didn't even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engage in gang rape you didn't hear that John\nI think I got something on China he didn't hear that bit of news yeah this so called serious offense is not outraged if they're examining from President Trump's respective or many of his supporters\nThe media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so they're no longer object the reporters and a part of sense of the left which they have become\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy\nDoes to the detriment of the truth\nSo for example I'll talk about on the next are illegal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother never mentioned the fact that none of this would happen if the mothers didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that was a more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone is guilty of a crime catch this\nTheir children are also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother or father\nHow come that hardly ever reported by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener so the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she was on Fox News even though he more pick on them\nAs all at all it's all they lack the proper documents to come to this country or your house or take your bank account they just don't have the right documents\nSo of course many people never hear the other side of issues if the press barely reports then so in that sense they're an enemy of the people because they're denying all the facts to the people and not allowing them to make their own decisions let me know what you think I think this is a big part of the issue he's right\nLet me know what you're

network in the last star where he certainly talking about they respect the shootings at the temple\nAnd and then it kind of a vault into a\nPeople blaming certainly the media and of course the Democrats left it's all the same thing these days blaming President Trump for the pipe bomb or bomber blaming President Trump for the shootings at the temple\nIt never ceases to amaze me that everything that goes on that's bad it's his fault and um even in the most serious charges against and the one I think that most offended up being the press is that the people\nAbout the pressures the enemy of the people which I think they are because they don't report the news objectively and that was basic to our founding that they'd be a free press are reporting the facts and not giving into government figures that they agreed with\nAnd make it easier like they did on President Obama and by the way speaking of President Obama he said some awful things to that could incite people like me normally I'm not heard people like my son we have that clip let's play\nA democratic and\nSo you don't punish political\nOr threaten the freedom of press just because you don't like what they say you're right\n\nHow democratic\nOr Republican [laughter] we don't target certain people that haven't\n[noise]\n\n[noise] no but I'm not going to do what\nThink that there's nothing about\nImmigrant children from the mother\nNo no\nSo why isn't bad inciting people to violence you see how he says so passionately and in it you know the anger in his voice that ... people on my side let alone President Trump that were against people based on how they look or how they really\nWhen did that first happened I didn't I must have missed it or when we were just looking for the compassionate Republicans right he really needs to Republicans that don't stand up for themselves but I Love the last one because I was going to talk about illegal immigration in this hour ripping\nImmigrant children not no it's not illegal immigrants but ripping immigrant children and talking about from the cold spell running them out of the arms the mothers or fathers and and you know however you put a I'm paraphrasing and they wind up\nIn a in a coal sell how was that incitement on his side for some ... yeah you do that to children away from their parents we better do something about how come when he does it it's okay how come when he he actually is lying\nAbout opposition worst President Trump lie I Want you to point that out in\nTerms of politics I think that there's nothing about\nMay immigrant children from their mother\nLeaving them in a cold sell cars that makes me pretty angry how come it's not on their side\nThat that that's OK when they do but it's only President Trump you see the visceral hatred for this president\nAnd as I mentioned on Larry show friday you know the reason for it\nIs because we finally have a Republican who standing up to the other side who doesn't let them get away with anything look\nLike you I'm I'm not thrilled with everything he says is Dennis as you get the\nTotal package with everybody but the fact is they hate him they hate him with a passion because finally someone standing up to them that's what I think someone is really not letting them get away with it remember John McCain to do anything about personal bombing he didn't want people to even mention the fact\nThat he may have been you know the way he talked about\nThe America should I Apologize and you know the issue about where he was born I get that one but you can't say anything about President Obama that was sack religious so to speak but it's okay you can do anything you want to say about President Trump is okay and the press is complicit with this\nSo yeah on my side\nYou can't say anything but on the other side you could do what you want and it was very hard I gotta tell he was very hard for me is the last caller last hour said even some Jewish leaders I shouldn't say even what a surprise most of them are on the left to say all the climate from the top down that's what you're doing that's what's creating madman\nWell let me tell you if I was a little over the edge what President Obama did could maybe if I was a crazy evil person may be pushed me over the edge\nHow can you compare that mark how could you say that a president bomb was just this great guy right like he never lied he never set up a straw dummy like you said an immigrant children it's not immigrant children and how come it's not mentioned that when people go to jail their kids have taken away from them because people don't want you to know that\nYou don't want to have that kind of ... let me know what you think when a\nPredator seven seven six I'm hearing it live and the pain free relief factor dot com studios and let me get to your calls and rabbi day and I'm not sure if it's a different take or not rabbi Dan you're on with mark\nAnd mark how are you real good\nUm I

is representing the Jewish community and unfortunately\nPeople often go because the neighbor entirely what are the ones that don't live\nWithin the more traditional Jewish but on the part of your characters who we are great appreciation cook has done for the country and stay with Israel and all the moving up the embassy um everything with the UN\nUm it's it's just an unbelievable were grateful and if you find\nThe more traditional around to see much like\nPeople are more conservative and people have more conservative values that we expect it and we also know that we have to cook so you're in the mid ... we haven't cured he's just not talking is perfect\nBut you can't get in and they got the answer box without going you got there we go to your clock right have a ... yeah then or are run by the office and it's unfortunate reality of life and then in the medical ...\nSanction rabbi Dan I appreciate very much and I forgot that right we should mention that he's got orthodox or grandchildren but certainly the idea that he's anti Semitic yeah they put that off at the beginning also doesn't matter if you have some on the air\nEverything goes none of it matters let's go to Peggy in Chicago Peggy you're talking with mark\nI work I I heard and I mean I just want oh my God how come to a presence over there I I heard that public health department and department of public

not checked for disease they are carrying inside the antibiotic resistant TB\nTV was a scourge in this country and therefore scourge until you're in an antibiotics to check it this is resistant to it we're opening our our borders to people who are very sick\nThey are some of 'em are like typhoid Mary show no symptoms but they'll carry the disease here and public health can handle that it's a huge number of people that go directly into the population you're at risk your kids are at risk\nThis is a public health problem ... threatened to overwhelm the country and like I Know I've heard you know President Obama you know if you want your doctor you can keep your doctor I mean he sounds great but the fact is we got screwed\nOn health insurance because of him and like if somebody says a good thing that's that's great but where's the beef\nShow me the the product was going to happen in public health there's nothing the mess around with their people to stand for you in the middle of your community and President Trump is right we have a crisis on our border\nAnd people don't even know about it I call the Chicago Tribune which is just purchased by another company they're like the new kid on the block [noise]\nAnd when they get a hold of the story I don't know what's gonna happen I mean we're we tend to be a democratic town but we're concerned about our kids were concerned about her family\n[noise] yes I guess turtle bomb on there and help kind of go on praising and cutting down\nTrump Trump it's been in the ... not only on helping our country but other countries who just want them to be able to have their own culture and we can have our culture now we see what Obama kid when that Sony film came out on all that that\nFreedom of speech but that movie and I liked that movie I even laugh at that movie and really I Would like to kill Kim Jong il All right so then he would like them to kill\nCame John earning ... said why do they want to kill me come when at a totally different way even like him he realizes\nThat Kim genre one one could go right about his background\nAny take that into consideration now what do we have we had the south Korean president who is Catholic [noise]\nTaking on a letter Pope Francis come over and visit North Korean peninsula we no longer have that ballistic missile that came at Hawaii and I ... missile finally worked and shot it back\nHe's not lobbying missiles into their place near Japan are flying over or threatening to attack on Guam and that's the only one thing he's gotten in other countries and and the fact that he has done in our country\nTo point eight percent raise or Social Security\nThis year for our people on Social Security\nYeah he's done he's done a lot there's no doubt about that and they don't want to acknowledge that in any way let's go to Jerry in uh San jose jury you're on was mark\nCan I can\nOkay great hate my point is when a President Trump has asked for so long to get rough stop whatever it's somebody pausing squabble and it's that particular person but what appalls me is that democratic leaders would say\nKick everybody be an civil to everybody and I think that the point that the

R. at AOL dot com [noise]\nAnd if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis Prager ... last friday and it's already can continue to talk about some of the things we've been talking about the last few hours but I said I wanted to talk about illegal immigration\nEspecially with the caravan approaching I've talked about illegal immigration for over Twenty years now and I've never wavered in my position\nThe issue is really not that difficult if you acknowledge the simple fact\nThat people cross the border illegally have come here legally as one caller pointed out which one of those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens so you have to term undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents and if\nThey miss place them somewhere or loss thing because if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over\nIf there are legal then they're not allowed to be here and a story\nIf you own a home and if someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they belonged in your home but they just lacked the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walked into your bank and wants to take the money out of your account they would be asked to prove that it is their account if they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents to prove that the banks would not permit them access\nWhich is why so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase on document as if they are entitled to your house and bank account if only they could find a misplaced documents\nFor years now I've said that the left as one of the argument over language whether it's undocumented versus illegal livable wage versus minimum wage global warming or climate change or whatever it is the moment\nBut the left is much better to finding the terms and using the language to their benefit of course that helps to have a media on your side perpetuating these false it's so so those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they're explaining the ...\nAnd the most recent case being parents with children trying to get asylum if that's really the case if they're not just coming in for the benefits of work\nAnd President Trump and Republicans accuse you heard President Obama and last hour we had the clip them fan of ripping children from the mother's arms and putting these children in coal cages [noise]\nNever mind that this was started under the Obama administration\nHas more I mean but would be the right word but anybody I Know President Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place they would be no issue no one force them to come here they made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes\nBut the left the Democrats and the media often the same thing do not believe in sovereignty but rather they believed in open borders\nBut they don't like to admit it because they know they would lose the argument which is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms never mind that when anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail they'll their children do not go with them to jail\nThey're also then so to speak torn away from them\nAnd the ... in the latest reincarnation of this conflict hundreds of Hondurans another legals are heading to the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nThat was no doubt my my name is Thirteen and other people who would do us harm or among them so again President Trump to Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media no doubt about it will again show you crying children and distraught mothers\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right as I said to decide who gets into our country or a house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right to protect the American people from arm where the from terrorism or as one caller mentioned last hour disease or even for that matter to make sure that people who come here is a radical concept share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south Mexico\nSome of us think this is so obvious\nBut there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense\nI mention it last hour the Democrats won more votes and the country club Republicans want cheap labor of course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party I Know so you have people like George W. Bush remember this and Karl Rove saying things like Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote when he ran and Texas\nWonderful I'm not a math\nMajor but that seems like a formula for defeat\nA lost in politics or sixty to forty percent is huge and that's based on optimistic assumption most the ... illegal immigrants come here for jobs as we'd long established but they also take advantage of government ... that the rest of us are paying for and the Republican Party can never out to the Democrats in offering better give it up\nSo here's a phrase I've used over the years if ever given a choice between Democrats and Democrats they always choose the real thing\nWho are these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked Republicans will never win a national election again so even even\nOn a purely selfish basis for those in the conservative side it was clear that we need to control the border but how about fairness for everybody what do you say to people around the world who have been waiting many years to get here but I have to undergo long waits and in ... and you bought a magical paperwork even have a chance of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those are ... across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools one color on a different radio network when I was on a week or so ago suggest that border walls don't work in the long run\nBut even if that were true I told them I bet they work in the short run to stop masses of people come here don't you wish we had a border now as we will are going to be confronted with these people in short time not to mention these really lives saved for murder by their fans we need we need to clean this mess up and I have an orderly procedure for coming into our country\nAnd I don't mean with a comprehensive immigration plan that has been signed onto barrel public as like Bush George W. Bush for Paul Ryan no amnesty and no pathway to citizenship should be accepted that rewards illegal behavior\nBut there to those who say the border wall won't work they use the same ridiculous logic I mentioned this that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent Americans use and I had it\nWhen they say the documents commit oh he said the court challenge me have they committed mass murder no it's not like the argument or have they commit fewer crimes percentage wise the Native Americans who cares even if that is true\nIf an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry in the first place no matter what the percentage and that well preventing one Hamas murderer in Israel for mentoring would have said that Israelis life\nThe logic of these arguments is baffling unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms for example how you ever justify sanctuary cities where criminal illegals or given safe harbor\nYou come up with a phony arguments like illegals will not cooperating with the authorities you've heard this if they know they can be apprehended are sent home\nBut how about not allowing them to come in the first place and then we wouldn't care if they cooperated with the Saudis how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate to the evil police officers in ice who have the audacity to arrest people who commit crimes soft rest of us have to live with long waits at hospitals deteriorating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities\nSo what's my solution I said I Would give it to take away the benefits like free healthcare and preschools you force strict penalties against businesses which one of you mentioned that hire illegals even sending some see CEOs to jail\nAnd you would be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney had it right but he used the wrong language there we go again when he said self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remain I'd be willing to have a conversation with because they would say for the right reasons\nHey mark veteran took my call sure hey I wanted to follow up on your comment earlier about the term illegal alien a button and a different a vein or you know the advocates of amnesty and high levels of immigration of always described the\nIllegal alien population is one made up of otherwise law abiding people who've done nothing more than cross the border illegally mhm\nWell the reality is is that they're coming here for jobs in order to find a job they've got a lot of nine Ryan foreign but when they do that and say they're here legally they commit perjury which is a felony Bobby", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "29"}
