on it\nIt says you can't do work so I don't do work\nSimple as that fact you should see my column this week it was a it was explaining the left\nAnd its contempt for the middle class bourgeois Judeo Christian values system and that explains their belief that they are that normal moral rules do not government\nThat is why they can shout down people at a restaurant conservatives do not because they believe there are rules that govern them that's why they can close bridges because they don't believe rules govern that this is an extremely important thing\nThe smearing of judge Kavanaugh on an unprecedented unprecedented smear up a good man I I we are in fact Alan Dershowitz calls it worse than McCarthyism man who's been a is a lifelong Democrat because he's a liberal\nAnd he does

they are ... ... ... is the Superman literally over men\nThey are over the rest of us over the deplorable deplorable believe in middle class Judeo Christian values left ... left wing or do not they are governed by what they feel is necessary to achieve their ends they break eggs to make a left wing ...\nAnd that is what we are seeing a happening I mean we I I got on to that because I was explaining\nI Do feel governed by rules\nSo you can yell and that's why I've said also often you could yellow conservatives for being hypocrites because they have a standard\nBut you can who who was a yelled at left wing hypocrisy there's no such thing as left wing hypocrisy because there are no rules that govern them so you can't be a hypocrite if you don't promote it rules\n\n... by the way another another matter in this regard my original column that this ... this charge should have been ignored it was right on I'm the only one to the best of my knowledge rhyming on this in the national

guy's face in a bar through ice and the guy's face fall in college\nSo what so what\n\n[laughter]\nThe reason that left this don't have any problem with doing this\nIs they are ... they are they believe that getting rid of his nomination before the elections is a good that overwhelms moral norms you can destroy a man and his family a good man and his family\nBecause overriding that\nIs the good of not allowing for the first time in the lives of just about any American conservatives to have a majority on the Supreme Court\n\nI Can't speak for before Nineteen sixty two but I can tell you about a Nineteen sixty two it was already governed by the left because they ruled the prayer in school is unconstitutional as idiotic as a whole series of as as an judicial forget idiotic\nAs not

I don't have I don't have a vested interest in this argument okay I I actually was a good guy and high school and I let an anti cheating on tests campaign I was elected the graduating class president I I was a bird was a good guy basically\nBut I'm I'm sure that things could be brought up I mean that I don't even know about\nOr that didn't happen which is I think is a possibility or in the case of birth capital but happen or not happen with\nThe ... they were kids in in high school who were uh near two wells and who ended up fantastic adults\nSo ... who cares who cares and in effect now I care about how my kids act in high school ... acted in high school\nOf course you care about how your kid acts at the age of five\nThat's a separate issue you ... you because you you want to form a good person as early as possible I I agree with that but in ... in in the perspective of a life and in retrospect\nWhat how you acted in high school should have no bearing in undermining once assessment of this person in middle age that's my position do you think do you think it matters that's the question\nOnly Prager seven seven six\nEight seven seven to for three triple seven six\n\nBig stuff big stuff that people left to answer it's hard for me to believe that anybody listening even Democrats\nHiring a person for a an important position in their business Qunu what a terrific person misses and men charges arose from high school within say no I'm Sorry\nIt's clear what type of adult you've been put in high school are you uh you you robbed a a candy store or a that's pretty serious not not not simply\nNot simply shop lifted some candy bars but you threaten the owner or and and you robbed\nBut it is obvious you turn your life around or otherwise what is what one is saying is people cannot turn their lives around we won't let no point to acknowledge\nThat your turn your life around that is why religious Jews and Christians find this notion particularly offensive because they're both Judaism and Christianity is so rooted in the importance of benefits of forgiveness\nOf tissue vi in in the Hebrew of of return or that's repentance\nThat is this famous Hebrew statement that I'm a ... literally translated from the Hebrew where a penitentiary stands the most righteous\nPerson cannot stand the raw higher level if you turn your life around the person who never turned their life around them has been good the whole time\nThat's how that's how and and of course obviously in both religions forgive right forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us the whole the whole notion of Christ dying for people sins and forgiveness\nAnd\nThe uh Judaism holiest days the day of of uh of ... a day of atonement Yom ... so religious Jews and Christians understand of course people can turn their lives around\n\nSo uh I emphatically endorsed the notion that when you are already in middle age and the blood a good life that's all that matters I have no interest in what you were like in high school\n\nAnd bribery where where is your country cutting off line is el is elementary school right well you know elementary school well yeah that's what people said until recently about
