have appreciated\nPeople are this is the America that I that I I really like\nA wise guy America\nHyper sophisticated fools that um habits so many of our urban areas that are going to graduate school too long and become stupid\nSo that's my that's my initial take\nI have everybody not just stupid callous jaded mean but other than that I think a K producing terrific people yeah\nBeen be so what is it now seven thousand have you seen pictures of the caravan coming in from largely from Honduras\n\nLike to talk to somebody about how the how how did they get through the Mexican border the Mexicans just don't care I\nI keep remain conflicting reports of it's not clear to me they only let six hundred forty and then there are seven thousand so is it six hundred forty years at seven thousand\nAnd it's it looks like seven thousand to me it's a mile long and again the question is how how did they just have such a large group get through Mexico about that I think Mexico cares a\nSubstantial part of their population lives in the United states in funds Mexico they send back billions of dollars\nWe take the unemployed off Mexico's hands I mean we're essentially were a note silly every government of Mexico and the United states\nAnd the left thinks that that is a terrific thing even though all it does is in ... the Mexicans to avoid confronting their own issues\nIf every country could send all those who are not employed or all those who are unhappy to another country why should you deal with any of your problems but hey that's you know\nThat that pales that question pales in significance compared to the possibility of more Democrats\n'cause if you can't make enough Democrats in your own population you need to import Democrats so that you can win more elections so that's what they do the import Democrats met an amazing thing is that done anywhere else in the world and the democracy we import millions of people\nIn order to have you elected that's what it's about\n\nAnd it's a it's a big question we should have some folks um because the big question here how are they going to be stopped see this is me my fear is that\nThey will obviously they will have to be physical stoppage of people but not going to come to the border they'll say please turn around okay we'll go back a thousand miles or six Seventeen hundred miles I don't I don't know what the distances back to Honduras\nBy the way I just want to add I feel for every one of these people like totally feel for them\nTo live in Latin America is largely to live in a corrupt society\nSeats a fascinating thing we're supposed to we're supposed to acknowledge that they should come into the United states because things are so terrible for them but if you say why things are so terrible for them then the left accuses you obscene a phobia or racism\nSay they're really fleeing wonderful places where where there is little corruption and great opportunity they just prefer California\n'cause they they like our beaches but of course they have beaches so there was not landlocked to the best of my knowledge so I I don't ah\n[laughter]\nI I have to live in this big bully world that are on the left is created there's no difference between American culture Latin American culture no none whatsoever American culture was not superior and the moral weight to Latin American culture\nBut everybody wants to fleet vast numbers wonderfully they're equally wonderful cultures to come to our less wonderful or equally wonderful or non wonderful culture get it that's what you're supposed to believe if you are college educated\nThere's no difference there's no moral distinction between Latin American American culture that's amazing I guess while you are so many Americans fleeing to embarrass why should they be why should they be impoverished they have food\nThey've perfectly they're perfectly acceptable natural resources\nThe reason Latin America is largely an economic failure is because it's largely corrupt\nAsked our friends in Brazil is\nIs is there a few as ... as intelligent Dustin ... people was the Brazilians but they're mired in corruption corruption is is the greatest problem outside of Iran on the trace of beer\nThat global warming my friend's corruption but nobody wants to talk about it because it sounds like you are attacking another culture but I Am attacking another culture I'm not attacking another race or another ethnicity or\nRace or ethnicity or insignificant culture is everything\nSo I I don't know what will happen at the border I I don't know how they will be stopped they ... but otherwise if you want them in that you are aligned to yourself and to everybody else if you deny your for open borders\nSeven thousand people want to come in that seven thousand more voters plus there plus their families the this is the Democrats this is awesome\nI listen to the political pundits who are divided on this list will just seem to be good and we were approaching this hugely hugely nation changing election possibly\nThe American people choose a Democratic House you were going to just see the two years of hate filled investigations of of the presidency\nTo try to
