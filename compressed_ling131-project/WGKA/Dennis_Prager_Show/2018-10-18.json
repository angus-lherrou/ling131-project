about people walking into schools gunning down students\nThousands shot in Chicago by drug gangs clerics um abusing shouldering a there's just wall pure evil across the board and um while thinking about those stories I came to the conclusion that Americans are numb\nTo the growing evil around us and the only way that evil is defeated is if people confront it not turn away as they did in Germany I'm In the late Nineteen twenties in Nineteen thirties\nUm so I decided to regularly access because we had written killing Patton huge success\nAnd we had a lot of research material leftover we got the Israeli government to cooperate with us on ss opened files at a net been seen before which is why we're able to put the reader on a step by step of the abduction of Eichmann in Argentina\nUh we had a lot of new stuff that's never been put in print before so I decided to write it but the over arching is I Want the world not just Americans and know that he will exist and we have to confront it\nYes it did now I don't know whether they call themselves or death or not but the set up a was um that the they used the two letters S. S.\nBecause of a of Hitler and what they did was they have this apparatus and you ask the question was what surprised you so they set up this apparatus and they have tons of gold and tons of looted cash\nA and they have assassins\nWorking for them and and the ... the organization had a rat line what Martin new garden I called a rat line from Germany to Italy Jenna way Italy where they got these ss guys down there put 'em on boats and then they went where they went\nMost of them to Argentina where the parole and government was bribed to allow them in and to keep them they're protected\nSo they're Red Cross shelter Switzerland to help the ss so to the F\nA beginning CIA and sorted elements of the Catholic Church and I'm Catholic so all of that surprised me and we documented pretty thoroughly in a book and then to track down um you would think that the Israeli government would really want to get these guys in the beginning they did not\nAnd they didn't want to reopen this and they wanted to concentrate on protecting the new state of Israel from the Arab threat and they had to be badgered\nInto tracking down I meant and manga law and the others that surprised us and then there's you know surprise is all across the book individual stories that we tell\nSo let me ask you you I Love the fact that you have a preoccupation with evil which has been me my story since I was in high school so I I asked a Holocaust survivor men went through Auschwitz the rabbi Leon Reza ... passed away\nAnd I was with him for many many years and I I finally interviewed him and I asked him how does how did he explain the ss guards in the camps and their sadism\nAnd he used the phrase that I have kept in my mind ever since it's the ... the one thing that I truly remember from my interview and he said they were monsters human faces do you subscribe to that theory\nCapsule literally means S.

make believe it's all make believe\nFor whatever reason and it's all psychological what ... ... it's there's no other explanation there was a beep beep beep or\nUnhappiness\nMaladaptive miss to reality on the part of the people who were braced these things and certainly those who develop them they have contempt for the world as is conservatives understand that the chance of making the world worse\nOr is the chances of making the world worse or at least as good as far as making the world better when you have a revolutionary idea\nMaking the world incrementally better is spectacular that's what we should be doing that every generation\nBut overthrowing the foundational ideas of a society because you have a dream up something better which is what character respects the characteristic of the left remember from the boat to fundamentally transform the United states of America that's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen\nShe writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing her main deliberately 'cause I have no desire to I'm not a leftist I have no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important to she is she they're interchangeable they have feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left\nA but it is interesting that there's no mention in any of the columns by her or older women riding in this column in the Washington Post that may be part of the solution to their loneliness and she says I have never been so lonely to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the the word marriage there's not even enter\nShe's a she is divorced if I'm not mistaken a buck cheat the there's no mention of of marriage so she wants to wish racial loneliness we've\nRelationship or even an unappealing temporary are fleeing would appear from what I'm reading\nThe divide between men and women is never felt so wide and I have never been so lonely too what does she described that I Know what I describe it to\nAnd then she writes about her on her being uncomfortable with this really nice man she went on a date with for three hours\nAnd he kept saying whatever you're comfortable with when she asked where he wanted to eat lunch he said whatever you're comfortable with and now I read to read from her over the course of three hours that lied became as ... ... she didn't like that\nAnd then what I even not only put in bold for myself to underline what it was time to part ways\nI was comfortable giving him a platonic hug it was not sexy being the woman the driver seat for three hours so if they're managing the driver CDs patriarchal guy and\nA probably a somewhat of a massage therapist and if she's in the driver's seat she doesn't find it sexy well and then she wonders why she's never been so lonely in her life because what the feminist like all much this living to make believe world\nReality it is is awful and then they have an imaginary world were things will be better so she says if the demand is a dominant decision maker that's a glaring red flag that's what she writes after she's disgusted with the guy who says whatever you're comfortable with\nI don't need a man she says to ask permission for every movie makes but of course that is exactly the way young men are taught today you have to ask permission for every move you make\nWe shouldn't let the battle cry of consent translate into boring sex see this is they they just said that they want their cake and eat it is like it's so trite they want to change the world into some imaginary things that can't exist\nIntentions are important in

you know where your date stands on Brett Kavanaugh you showed\nSo she said she doesn't like to talk politics on first dates but now it's inevitable that she wants to know where they stand on Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she writes a few years ago when I was getting back to dating after getting over a breakup I told the friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox okay listen to this this has nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh destroy the title but listen to this again\nI told a friend about how I felt stuck in a paradox I wanted to be open to love but I also wanted to protect myself from the emotional wounds that dating and relationships and memorably can bring\n\nTo junior to this is a grown woman their children left his two children that horse they'd do want to grow up I Want to be open to love

children there is no exception ... or at heart children they do not want it to grow up\nUp means facing reality being prepared for her that's the reason for safe rooms at all of that stuff\nThey are snowflakes some of them are even my snowflakes but they're snowflakes they're not grown ups does it amazing thing she admits this like the other woman admitted in the Washington Post held only she is and how crappy relations between men and women are\nI Know I continue reading at that moment it felt difficult to do both\nNow I imagine a lot of the leaders feel stuck in the same dilemma\nReally that's not true\nLeftist staters are stuck in this dilemma conservatives have mature understanding of life it involves inevitable pain various pain in life this is if you can't do anything about it\nLife has pain you want to live fully that's the garden of Eden story people chose pain and full life over little pain or no pain and not a full life\nI'm finishing my huge genesis commentary in
