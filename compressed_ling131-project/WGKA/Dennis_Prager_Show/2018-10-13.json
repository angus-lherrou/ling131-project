Democratic Party at this moment here Dennis Prager\nDana Bash interviewing the senator from Hawaii who is one of the uh more or where it was about trigger all equally left okay what looks here because this is priceless\nIsn't it and Republicans what they're saying is that democratic protesters are quote an angry mob and wouldn't want to ask you about it is you know one thing to try to laugh and laugh at the Capitol that's done for for example racer and frankly since the founding of the country\nIt's another thing to run senators out of restaurants go to their home is that going too far\nI think that in their rules that there are a lot of people who are very very much I'm motivated but what is going on because I Know that\nIf that does not disqualify this woman from serious moral consideration nothing does\n... do you do you think that Republican senators seeing white we mobs go into restaurants and starts screaming and cursing at at a democratic officials you think they would say well we'll just shows people are motivated\nBut it needs to just broken now and and other things like cutting government regulations us would have done and the secretary of state's office with all of our systems and that's what I Want to do through the whole executive branches governor and I think a lot of those things line up with him\nTalking to secretary of state Brian Kemp Republican candidate for governor of Georgia let's talk about illegals I you brought that up just now it's a big topic for me a lot of Georgians and I saw a recent article in the AJC that pointed out that\nAtlanta public schools as an example where my kids go to school\nIs going to kind of turn a blind eye to a legal sent allow them to go to school and allow them to break the laws and take advantage of taxpayers here in Georgia\nMade me fairly angry as a voter in a taxpayer because I have to go through a mountain the paperwork every year just to get my kids are very qualified for the school I'm legal I pay taxes yet these people walk across the border how do we deal with that in Georgia as a whole under a governor camp administration\nWell first and foremost you not have a strong public safety reform platform going after criminal illegals me one of the things that we have in our state is we have two different things we're dealing with federal prosecutors saying publicly that\nThe Mexican drug cartel has created the distribution hub in the state of Georgia for you know all these illegal activities that are driven by the drug trade when you think about math heroin whatever it is it is truly an epidemic in our state is contributing\nTo the opioid epidemic is also contributing to sex trafficking and in anything that drives you know illegal\nActivities for financial gain and I'm absolutely going to go after that I had developed to different plans one stop and dismantle plan to go after these you know illegal cartels that are doing business here and putting the hammer down on them given law enforcement the tools they need to do that\nIn a support local prosecutors and in doing that as well no matter where they are no matter what it is 'cause there's you know over Seventy thousand\nGang members here as well and that's the second thing that we have to go after a is stopping in dismantling gangs so that's that's one part of something that's driven by illegal immigration from a criminal element\nAnd then you have the other side which really you have to deal with the federal level which is revamping the system is one reason I supported\nSenator David produced raise that really ... the system to end chain migration\nTo secure the border so we can have a legal system where people can come here there's a lot of legal\nNow citizens in the United states that are frustrated by people that have such an easy access illegally because they waited they went through the process and the and the correct way and they now are taxpayers just like we are and when you're you know allowing people that are here illegally to get\nGovernment benefits like education you know access to the ... scholarship\nWorthy medical care by just simply setting foot in an emergency room I mean we're paying that bill you know you and I are paying the bill other worked in Jordan's are paying that bill and I think people are really frustrated by that I mean we certainly are you know look I'm sympathetic to what people want to come to our country\nBut we can go to other countries and take our kids pounding area illegally and get free health care or free education\nTo go to Mexico there there as strict as Trump says he wants to be here in America and read a yet we're hypocritical in that argument or what is it in Georgia though in your estimation that we failed to do because I think the problem\nOf illegal immigration gangs crime drug trafficking sex trafficking all of that is getting worse I think that's a fair statement\nWhat what has allowed that to happen if you could put your finger on one not not that I Know there are many issues but one big issue politically or policy wise I think\nI think politics ... you know times of London to white honestly I'm you know the end you're seeing this more with the the radical socialist part of the Democratic party\nIn my opinion that embrace things like sanctuary cities or California being a sanctuary state where they're just saying hey look\nSome dire state if you're illegal we're not going to come after you and in any way and you know we welcome you here will you know that is going to be very expensive for their tax payers blesses rake in federal law\nUm and that's just you know not the way this country works thankfully door does not like that but we do have\nCommunities around the state that either publically or quietly or a break embracing that by not you know speaking to ice when they arrest someone that's you know here legally not being willing to hold\nAn individual and all I can get there to start the deportation process\nAnd you know that may not to talk to somebody the other day and they were they were upset because you know somebody they knew that they said was a good person but it was here illegally\nWill I'm sure that they probably were but they were driving without a driver's license which means I had no insurance and they got pulled over and they got arrested in the guy's going to get deported but it's like I told them I said you know\nI hate it for the guy but he's breaking the law\nHe's here legally he doesn't have a driver's license and if he had hit you are one of my children we'd be stuck holding the bag because he has no insurance and we got ... and that's you know it's a it's a tough it's a tough deal and it's got to be tackled at the federal level but I think there's things that we can do it the state level especially on the criminal side\nTo be able to go after him and that's what we need to do it on the flip side of that I'm also a strong supporter of the age to a an H ... visa program\nSo we have gas workers in this country\nAnd in areas where we need them like in agriculture they'll get our crops out of the field very hard finding you know American citizens that will do that work\nWe need these workers there is a legal process for them to come in and work and get paid in return home and come back\nThe next year the problem is that that system is old and an antiquated\nThe red tape needs to be cut out of it is very expensive and so we need to do our farmers of favor when we do

had met the libertarian candidate for governor of Georgia had great to have you\nKnow you're very much for having me Brian uh really uh I I really appreciate them a media making note that I'm actually running for governor in Georgia\nWell let's let's talk about taking no because there was a new landmark pole and let me just say I\nI hate polarizing pulled our holy an addict inadequate in an accurate in this day and age but to that point\nThat's been the news or the governor's race this week showing a dead heat between secretary of state Brian Kemp the Republican for governor Stacey Abrams the Democrat a camp up two points you somewhere in the two to three percent range as a libertarian candidate or just your reaction to that landmark\n... um since since you can't take a poll on a cell phone and call landlines and mostly with people that have landlines are are not like up to speed as far as technologically speaking so I don't trust those either\nUm again what's gonna happen in this election is it will throw it into a runoff race but at least I'll be able to be on stage giving my information about why the two party system is dead and broken and needs to be replaced\nThe I Want to give you plenty of time on that 'cause I I agree with you I'm not a Republican or Democrat it probably lean more libertarian but I I don't identify with any party or any group because that means I buy into a hundred percent of everything everybody says I Want to get to that in a second but the problem we have\nAnd I get a lot of flak on this the two party system seems to be dead in terms of its effectiveness\nOf the people of Georgia the people in this country but it seems to be instructive as to who wins it's either the Democrat or the Republican Ninety nine plus percent of the time and sometimes the libertarian leans more Republican in in in their positions and it can be a spoiler leaving liberalism to prevail what what do you say to that\nI Will say that there are plenty of of um of libertarians who are are strongly conservative and the conservatism actually trying to run\nIn the same vein as many of the conservative Republican point however most of most Republicans I Know actually lean conservative towards original intent constitutional is the number one and number two when they're talking like a financial fiscal conservatism\nAnd and preservation of of\nYou know the American as we grew up in\nI I have to say that there are a lot of candidates in front of the Georgia Libertarian Party who really were kind of more Republicans it's not accepted as Republicans by the Republican Party so\nI'm not really sure how to address that other than the more people know about what libertarianism stands for and what it actually means the more people will identify with yet you must be a republic are must be a libertarian I'm not a Democrat or Republican\nThe essence of being a libertarian is leave me alone don't tell me what to do and don't steal my stuff\nYou know and a lot of Americans go for that message it's amazing to me that the Libertarian Party doesn't get more traction at least some races\nUm but I think people don't buy into the fact that they can win with that vote so they feel like they're wasting their vote by the way we're with Ted met the libertarian candidate for governor of Georgia\nAnd the election coming up in November I'm you know I think I I

as we promised the audience on issues let's start and just rattle off as many as we can get to I Know you want to get to some of the amendments that are very dangerous for Georgians that I'm interested in your opinion on that so we'll try to cram all of that into the segment guns I'm Stacey Abrams the anti gun candidate obviously Brian camp\nA Republican he carries has gone everywhere it's almost become a running joke where where do you stand in the Libertarian Party on guns and gun rights in state of Georgia\nI Would like to start out by saying the bill of rights is the is the partial list of rights that we haven't Aaron Lee that were given by our readers according to the preamble of the nation my position on gun control is a firmer grip a balance stance and good site alignment is what\nSome federal about every occasion\nI shall not be infringed all of the founding fathers said that you know of owning firearms is against Iran hold government and it's getting more and more critical the poor people owned guns\nAnd that answer doesn't surprise me coming or libertarian it's it's a leave me alone or which is kind of battle is part of my stuff yeah don't take my stuff ah so ah let's talk about marijuana recreational marijuana legal for everybody to state of Georgia where do you where do you stand on that\nI'm I'd totally off\nWhat's going to be it's kind of a long answer because I've been in the marijuana space for at least five or six years actually the committee hearings going through all the elites hope stuff\nAnd at what we're going to talk first about recreation are ready to talk about medical first I Want to push for in state owned grow if you're a medical patients and have a of slipped from your doctor said that you can use\nCannabis for medical purposes you should be able to grow to at home by yourself plant in the closet with a plant like right now as far as recreational no no one\nUm there are so many people I think Seventy percent of Americans are taking some sort of a I'm Sorry one in seven Americans take some kind of medication for some kind of a mental disorder either depression or anxiety or she TST or whatever\nKind of a ... even if it's recreational can can cure all of those problems not not to mention all the other medical conditions that I'm kind of us can can treat not just highly make you feel better but actually the year\nSo I I Want to see marijuana legal in all aspects\nOf it just got back from from Denver and in Denver estate taxes recreational Fifteen Percent on on the distribution level and then another ten percent at these sales level and you know Colorado is has a booming economy does and and just the fact that it's a plant that God gave us you know genesis you know blah blah blah\nI'm this is ridiculous the human rights to be happy\nFor mental listen to me on the on the radio or follow me on on digital social media I\nI'm I'm always pro recreational marijuana has been for very long time I think it's ridiculous thing is less dangerous than alcohol that's always been my opinion and I ... as the gateway or is that the reason you think a lot of Georgians don't want recreate especially ... able to actually make it to the gate way propaganda\nUm you know the propaganda it started in Nineteen thirty five with um reefer madness and if you look at the marijuana issue is really all about what what the deal is with crony capitalism at large a group of of um industrialists basically had the legislation and marijuana stamp act in Nineteen thirty seven past one\nOf the person's was du pont your pots Patton for nylon was issued February Nineteen thirty seven the marijuana stamp act was enacted in November of Nineteen thirty seven and he was their lobbying to have that done to protect his nylon\nBefore nylon and broke was the best thing all of the founding fathers said basically that that that our strength of America was was the power of him\nSo anyway um emphasis being suppressed because it interferes with fat and fiber and interferes with with oil and interferes with at in medicines you know the FDA approved drugs and\nSay here's here's a here's the things that people you're basically saying is monopoly\nIt's much bigger than just some sort of a religious situation uh it's it's it's cronyism of some sort\nThat actually creates monopoly positions for the companies to make products with other means other than kind of it's kind of us can produce everything that oil producers including ... easily can produce enough bio diesel here in Georgia the fuel the entire planet diesel engines\nHad met with his libertarian candidate for governor of Georgia taxes and a little bit of a tax reduction in\nAlaska and we didn't we had a huge tax increase and all of his boss the last ... the transportation bill has a shell game they shuffle the deck chairs net net net were were ... even more even even if we did get a small eliminate the state income tax why not\nOther states surrounding us have no say they won't tell you what do you make Florida of one of your opponents\nStacey Abrams who uh according to recent news reports was in favor of raising taxes create more revenue for more programs now she said well maybe not maybe not walking that back what do you make of that is that I'm just chime in on that\nUm it's the same old political rhetoric held one group one thing because it teaches them telling other group another thing because I had a pieces them\nSo you know the rhetoric is the governor has no legislative authority he's not the one that passes the bills are he's just the one that signed the bill he's not the one that creates them so all of the all of my opponents who we're talking about legislative fixes are are talking pie in the sky because they're not the ones that are writing\nBills how do we pay the bills if we lower the income tax to to nothing or nearly nothing or what what what am I to me that ... that that's really the we we create a new new source of taxation in medical\nAnd recreational cannabis [laughter] and and all of the industries that kind of a complaint from plastics you know feisty and plastic is biodegradable which means it doesn't feel the plants have we done the math so to make sure that that would close the gap oh my God yeah OK billions and billions and do we have five\nAnd ... to the state constitution or on the ballot this November you're concerned about these you think we should vote no on all of them\nAbsolutely voting on levels and I said earlier them expand the power of the government to invade and encroach on our constitutionally enumerated nine year old right\nLet's start with business courts they want to point they weren't they had not elect a new\nSeparate classes citizens known as businesses\nAnd every time they create a new class of citizens bitter taste rights away from everyone else\nEssentially what the business court system is going to be it's going to be a parallel court system new judges new offices new facilities and why so they can prosecute more more businesses for not having a license or something like that but the bottom line on it is all of the judges are going to be appointed by the governor there not elected they're appointed\nWhich means they search for life in which means that if the governor has a problem with a particular type of business he can forces judges to\nNot follow the law but follow some sort of a policy\nThe uh amendment one for the outdoor recreation equipment stale federal ridiculous\nBecause it says that the recreation is it creates um if you're a\nSporting goods store ... part of your taxes from from sales taxes are going to go to outdoor projects which I think is fine but the famous not defined in the in the legislation is what is a sporting goods store is Walmart sell sporting goods target cells sporting goods you know the age of hidden tax here\nWell it could be it could turn out to be just a windfall for a couple of groups who\nOtherwise could collect donations for private organizations who actually use the land we need user fees instead of taxation\nForest land timber conservation that's amendment three and boy I tell you a conservation land is a huge tax scam uh we we have our county government are in many cases throughout the state of Georgia giving fifty percent discounts on the tax you have big rich developers donating you unusable land development rates to\nA conservation trust side I'm In the tied up in litigation personally with one that's doing that and it it harms my family and then he called it's called the scam holiday\nGrant a special privilege anytime they passed a law that favors a group or a person is called a grant a special privilege it's both federally constitutionally prohibited as well as prohibited mistake honest with\n\n\n\nTo ... bridge\n\nLovers believe everyone\nOut there in radio Len welcomed another sort of Janet radio colon forget that are
