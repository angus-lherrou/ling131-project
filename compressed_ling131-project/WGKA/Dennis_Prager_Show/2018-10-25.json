hour with Newt Gingrich here on the Mike Gallagher showing the relief factor dot com studios Mr Speaker I never thought I'd get inspired by the Washington Post but I I've interviewed Dan Balz\nA number of times over the years of various political conventions and debates and all and he wrote a piece this week headlined battleground house districts remained close in a new poll\nUm he he says that according to a new Washington post poll of the most contested districts in the country\nThe Democrats now hold a statistically insignificant lead\nOver Republicans again it's not supposed to happen that way there's this was supposed to be occurring Newt are or do we dare dream that the narrative that the Democrats are going to take the house but Republicans are going to control continue to control the Senate\nIs not going to happen and the Republicans have a chance of holding both chambers\nLook I I think social anybody who tells you to know what's going to happen\nOr just remember that two weeks out uh\nEverybody will she knew that Donald Trump would lose on election day uh five thirty eight the the New York times founded polling operation said there was a Seventy one percent likely other illegal when um\nBut you know virtually no one you know I Will say but some pride that I said for a long time they thought he could win then but but I like I say this far out a dynamic developing we'll see how the dynamic continues but but for the last few each part of the written about this in my newsletters\nAgain which productions um the\nThe cabinet effect did three different things one\nIt galvanized the concert these she got really angry at that sort of sleepwalking and happy and lots of good things but now they're angry and that's a huge increase in energy on the right which I see personal and I'm sure you see that as you're going to have an amazing look much more energy\nThan I can remember it anytime a in many many years\nA second I'm the mass came off\nOh I think it is the nastiness that Bush is this the Spartacus moment by Booker uh the the\nThe shouting over the chairman but by the Democratic senator from California Kamala Harris go down the list Harris\nI mean people the under you know the degree to which they are willing to exploit Dr Ford manipulate her keep her letter hidden spraying it at the last minute maximize public relations um people got a sense that\nYou know these people are really bad\nAnd I think the the the mass has continued to come off as we've seen more and more bad statements you more and more bad comments on the third thing that happened was all of a sudden particularly center racist\nPeople realized oh yeah this is a team sports and so somebody like bite us it would have been desperately trying to convince people in Tennessee that he was a moderate they looked up and they said wait a second you're going to vote for Schumer\nWell you want to moderate if you're going to show the latest polls that just came out this week show hike camp for example down sixteen points\nNow nobody and she's a very very competent a political figure she's very good campaigner has a very long track record not to go to nobody would have guessed that she'd be down sixteen points and everywhere you turn now racist that the Democrats thought they were going to win and gotten very very tight\nI'm In early voting machine or the Republicans are doing very well know again I don't I don't want to draw any any conclusion we still have almost two weeks\nAnd two weeks out I think Donald Trump would have lost\nBut he was gaining boats every single day right and if we keep gaining boats every single day and frankly a\nCaravan is is a is a huge burden for the Democrats that they just can't I think answer too and I think among suburban a woman who have been one of the real weaknesses for Trump as they think about him is Thirteen gangs and they think about cartels and they think about a lawlessness\nAnd seven thousand people determined to break the law I think they meet with Democrats and come back to the Republicans are in a much bigger numbers than people would have just a month ago\nIs just me or does it feel you you're talking about prominent Democrats and the missteps of the last month or so I mean we could go to Elizabeth Warren and her bizarre a\nDecision to release this DNA test and create a whole wave of of ridicule and scorn or the mob violence we're seeing we're seeing a Heidi Heitkamp I mean for crying out loud she she tells the world she was ready to vote yes on Kavanaugh until she watched his testimony with the sound turned off\nAnd she didn't like his facial expressions doesn't it feel like the Democrats are a bit like the gang that couldn't shoot straight\nI think they have a huge problem I think their their base so far less now\nAnd the energy of their base and the hatred that their base has for Trump is so intense yeah but they're surrounded all day by people who are giving them signals uh that don't work in the normal world right and so you know comments like em I'm sure that that one that former attorney general said when the Republicans you're down\nA little probably gonna go low we kick kick I'm a I'm sure in that immediate crowd they liked it\nBut for the rest of the country it it was a little sobering to have somebody who's been the chief law enforcement officer United States suggesting that Republicans ought to get checked right and it comes to comes in the middle of the whole way of these kind of states' rights and the other the other part of it is frankly a\nGeneration of left wing activist to get goofy things and said goofy things who are now running for office\nAnd we live in an age where YouTube and others allow us to track you know things he did so it's not just where they have an allergy thirty six years ago right one and a lot of these candidates do last year the year before\nRand it ain't pretty big earlier than the Democrats\nWell we're going to see if it's going to be in the morning to November the seventh I'll tell you what I loved was getting to spend an hour with you Mr Speaker thank you for taking time out of what I Know it was a crazy schedule for you and you're going back and forth with your wife in Rome and all the great things that are happening in in Gingrich land thank you Mr Speaker keep fighting the good fight we need your voice more than ever and let's hope we have some\nWe wake up November seventh there's some very good news for our country\nLike you thanks so much for joining us Newt Gingrich an hour with new\nYou're on the Mike Gallagher show in the relief factor dot com studios I told you you enjoy\nEvery second of that I sure did\nLockers tour throughout America\nOut and fight the good fight have a great Wednesday and be shaped Gallagher\nToday it is in Minneapolis and all the VIP part is sold out\nI don't know if the actual event is so you'll have to check with the station [noise]\nOr if you're still interested in coming that it should be a remarkable leaving last night in Dallas was terrific Charles Spicer along with my colleagues or some of my colleagues at the Salem review\nAs I test out airlines on a daily basis here I tell you one thing that I Do get a chance to test traveling so much is in the market for an SUV for the first time in my life\nAnd what I Do is I rent SUVs and it's it's a nice way of testing out as you these\nAre the real road for a day so that's what I've been ah that's part of what I have been doing\nSo as the ...\nThe press is the media or preoccupied with these bombs or these make believe bombs I'm not even sure which are bombs which are make believe bombs which could work which wouldn't work none of them did work\nThank God obviously nobody has a clue who was sent them and yet we have the following\nAs a given from the media and I'm going to play Mika Brzezinski a for you from MSNBC\nOne point that is just worth making\nI don't know if in a free society I'm In a in a police state you you might\nOf this but in a free society I'm not sure that the perceptions of reality among the the two halves are between the two halves of the society ideologically has ever been as different\nFor all intents and purposes ... and I do not live in the same society we did not live in the same country one of us is spectacularly wrong\nAnd it it it it's really it's a sobering assessments most of us is staggeringly wrong\nIt's not a and a new launch thing so listen to what she has to say and then they'll tell you what I have to say and you will decide or at least conjecture here she is today on MSNBC\nBut at that lacrosse I I think now that we're all ... springs that\nI Want to be honest I highly reactive Atlanta who cares about his president [noise] and I sell some of that even this morning [noise]\nWay down south to pack a day but I think now in my heart that President Trump there is a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that ... that top Democrats and the ... what they targeted\n[noise]\nWhat ... what is the what was the memorable rhetoric that top Democrats would be targeted\nNow I Know what they'll say about media and that is that he he has said that the un and the enemy of the people\nNow if I could have maker Brzezinski on the show this is what I Would ask her I Would say\nI'd like to establish where our perceptions of reality begins to defer when they have to start at some point with similarity so where do they fear so for example do do you acknowledge that\nIn the last two years since this president has nearly two years since he's been elected\nThe vet\nPeople on the rights have been far more harassed including politicians than people on the left\nThe candidates I've read to you folks were\nCandidates have been pushed or shove or punched out where they have been screened that curse that\nI I don't know of any parallels with regard\nTo left wing politician\nRight wing ... that his Republican House members were shot at and by sheer great heroism unlock none were killed\nNo democratic congressmen have been shot at in these past two years since he was elected\nPlus ... why is the mainstream media light coming of Donald Trump to Hitler why\nIs that not a coal to violence I don't I don't when I say I don't understand most people say when they don't I don't understand they're really saying I disagree I Try to be really precise so when I don't understand I don't understand I don't understand\nWhy your side would not regard like giving the president to Hitler as a coal to violence would not be obligatory on all moral people to kill a ...\nI I Would think it would be personally I [laughter] if somebody could have assassinate Hitler in the Nineteen thirties the thin ... uh\nApproximately fifty million innocence would have been saved\n\nWould have been one of the greatest acts of goodness in the history of the world so I I'm not quite understanding how you can call us white supremacists which is a horrible thing it's a it's an it's truly nuts you like\nAnd you are your side some out was gates the charge of fomenting hatred\n\nThis is what this is why it's part of what I ... daily note or almost daily is the author or lack of self awareness on the left it is it's an immaturity it's truly a immaturity is a major feature\nHops them complaining in gratitude all the features of a child will be found among leftists\n\nAnd one of them is a lack of self awareness I can scream and rant and rave complain call people every epithet then if there is one answer to me I scream bully bully\nYou are you who who am I oppose are sexist intolerant Xena phobic homophobic Islamic phobic racist bigoted but I in no way for men Tate\nI Can't even be considered as a hate mongering because I'm On the left just as the left features that no black can be your race has been including Louis Farrakhan for example\n\nThis is the world in which the Mika Brzezinski is live it's if it's a fairy tale it to its well fairy tales not good because they they are often positive it's it's a make believe it's used to make believe world and you can't fight people who live in uh make believe world\nRace sex and the fall of Baghdad to fall back on a fallback you name it now why isn't\nThat big coal\nTo violence what are you supposed to do with people who are who are that bad\nWill greet them with hey how you doing the hope you having a good day what are you supposed to do or why doesn't that count as creating a a an aura of\nEvil around people on the rise I really want to hear I I'm ... I'm so curious 'cause you know if you were on the left there you've differ with me even if you're on the right I Will treat you respectfully\nTell me why does all of that rhetoric white supremacists neo Nazis Nazi like this is the Nineteen thirties I read to you from the New York review of books from the Yale professor a scholar\nOn the Holocaust all the parallels\nThat he sees to that it was a piece of garbage was intellectual idiocy from ... from Yale Holocaust historian he gave Holocaust studies a bad name in that piece\nBecause people are young people who don't really know about the Holocaust reading all all that is what the hell out of the Holocaust\nIs the United states or the Weimar Republic is the United states today oh that wasn't that bad\nSo explain to me how how to you and if you even if you agree with me explain to me how they can Pearl these epithets and then say oh it's evident bowl president would do this and people some bombs\nSaddle up conspiracy theory on holes to act\nLike the way forgive me hold on I don't why does that mean a battle of conspiracy theories I I I'm a I'm not arguing with her I I don't know what does that mean a battle of his\nConspiracy theories versus left wing conspiracy theories\nIf I talk that clearly I really don't deserve a radio show this is not to insult to it it's the whole left does that they make these massive charges and I I ... I don't know what they're referring to what does that mean a battle of conspiracy theories\nIs it a conspiracy theory a does she think it's a conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in a in the last election\nI'm curious what she acknowledged it sets a conspiracy theory Bible you haven't heard much about that lately have you\nWonder why\nWhat if it turns out to be essentially nothing\nIs what will happen nothing\nLeft lies dominates the media for a year or two with allies they turn out to be lies and then they move onto the next fly that's the way it works there is no shame one of the joys of being on the left is never having to say you're sorry and never feeling embarrassed\nThat they have dragged this country through this fraud of Russian collusion\n\nThe leading the most is the end of the left wing media the New York times the Washington Post ABC CBS NBC NPR PBS\nAnd nothing it turns out to probably have been nothing they apologize you kidding are you kidding you are kidding go on please\n\nThere is a bearing on holes the accusations violent behavior Democrats\nDown time holiday Republicans poll how and when they're at public places like restaurants [noise]\nTicket encouraged by Maxine Waters don't do it don't they don't say that\nThey will test they several billion with a public health like Hillary Clinton said hey we said pick Republican all the former capital officials had don't get in that got her with the flow of this rhetoric\nThat's why they want they want an during Brett Kavanaugh hearings had got exactly what he wanted to turn to wait\nWait wait how K I I Know what I forgot I heard that\nI have an understanding of understand that that's what he wanted the gutter and the Brett Kavanaugh hearings\nPresident is responsible for the Brett Kavanaugh hearings\nThe relief factor race freeze\nAn nine twenty the answer\n[noise] with us\nOr a news ... new in Washington\nThe FBI is confirming the packages addressed the former vice president Joe Biden actor Robert De Niro are similar or the parents of those users and bombs of prominent Democrats FBI provided the updated a tweet this morning New York city police today recovering a package addressed to dinner with the same return address issues on the other\nPackages those forwarded pipe bomb attacks on prominent Democrats causing renewed soul searching and finger pointing and the political class is discovered the pipe bombs comes two weeks before the mid term elections the Associated Press is valid hospitals around the world are serving as makeshift prisons in some cases\nFirst they heal patients that they can't pay they detained them there and the practices generally illegal but the study shows is exceptionally common occurring in at least thirty companies mostly in Africa Asia Eastern Europe Latin America\nAnd the middle east this is as how I knew\n\nI Am twenty the answer traffic\nThursday the unions are happening propaganda faith anytime found found ...

cities and they're sold out the best of my knowledge although if I'm wrong and I feel bad because then you might have been able to go ...\nWell my friends the\nThe general tone of course of the media is what do you expect Donald Trump has been fomenting old was violent hatred and that's the reason for these bombs pseudo bombs real bombs not real moms ... I don't I don't really know yet\nAnd the\n... that I have a vote I offered the beginning of the last hour\nIs very simply the the amount of rhetoric of hate and of\nA calls for in your face physical behavior and the actual violent behavior has been so overwhelmingly from the left that ... it's it's almost surreal that people would say it's the president's\nRhetoric about forgetting these this bomb issue about which we know nothing or with regard to who sent them and why but putting putting that aside\nWhat speakers are threatened at colleges do you know the for the first time in my life of decades of lecturing I have asked for security\nWhen I go to Colorado State next week I have never asked for security I've been given it routinely but\nIt it's it's it to me it always struck me as a sort of pro forma thing you know two wonderful police officers would accompany me for my car but in this case I actually asked for the rhetoric of hatred or\nHas been directed against me in the in the Colorado State newspaper is is quite remarkable you it is it is probably like ... it is all made up everything about me is made up everything\nAnd it doesn't it doesn't matter to them because the truth is not a left wing value wife said that my whole life this\nProceeds Donald Trump this perceived Ronald Reagan this perceives ah\nIt it emanates from my study of the left from a college graduate school um it has never\nBeen a left wing value it's a liberal values are conservative value but it was not a left wing value\nAnd this is this is a perfect example on my mind is what I mean there are there are so many and the cost to violence you wouldn't even Mika Brzezinski acknowledged Maxine Waters\nTelling people get into the face of of politicians I Wonder why I'd like to know the last time that and a member of Congress of the United states told people to act on civil e towards fellow congressman\nOf the other party I I Wonder if there is a precedent to Maxine Waters truly an ugly human being and I'm not speaking of her physically I never in my life talk about people's physical uh looks it has nothing to do with that he's ugly in character in temperament\nAnd decency and morality and it it but it doesn't matter because it's you know it doesn't matter\nTo her credit ... after blaming the president then goes through the let me of of you know including Hillary Clinton will only be civil if we win ... she said that bill was last week Lori Clinton overturned disability after we win\nYes look the or the face of the left is coming through\nThere is a way to defeat the left though there is a way to embolden liberals as opposed to a leftist I managed to defeat them in this upcoming election you see it will be very hard for the left\nTo convince the Democrats other Democrats there are after all liberal Democrats not all left his\nBase supporting all left his party to their shame but they're not all leftist but they will have a harder sell hey our way is the better way if they can't even be Donald Trump\n... owning owning the colleges owning the high schools owning\nThe newspapers owning the cable networks except for Fox owning mainstream news and if they can't do it then uh maybe uh maybe their tactics are and all that effective so there is a way to defeat the left\nYou ... you have to vote in this upcoming election uh I\nI don't know who I'm angry Iraq somebody who claims to be conservative who won't vote a\nFor religious reasons\nOf pseudo religious reasons like a ... it's my ... my understanding of God God or\n[noise] if nothing else or just cite famous

to the past but it's really part of the current American situation you may recall the people who wanted to remove Andrew Jackson from a twenty dollar bill is probably the most controversial low everybody now for the left his controversial who lived before them\nSo that's not telling you much but we have a scholar on here professor of history and American studies in Hillsdale College Bradley burgers or\nJust written a new book which I Will be reading 'cause I I'm just finishing by sheer coincidence in some very very very very very very very long book on Andrew Jackson\nAnd I'm now got real interested in the American president and general and so I'm Bradley ... professor of history the book is in defense of Andrew Jackson and professor welcome to the dentist Prager show\nDennis Hi thank you so much for having me on great honor\nThat's very kind of you to say I am honored so the ... the the indictment of Andrew Jackson is I think largely over his treatment of American Indians is that fair to say\nYeah I think that's probably at least since the late Nineteen sixty that's been the great critique of the ...\nAnd so all of these ... the founders were were were worthless because they had slaves and uh you just go down the roster but the the Indian issue was a very very complex one\nAnd there were there were terrible things don't Indians Indians have terrible things to others including blacks who may enslaved including other Indians who may and slave and torture was for some tribes routine\nSo it's so there's no is no easy answer to this problem Andrew Jackson made his reputation aside from the war of Eighteen twelve in finding\nA ... Indians and uh he adopted an Indian child now so I just reviewing what we've said do you recall the point that you were making sure by move on\n[laughter] no actually I think that that's what I Would love to jump right back to the courthouse was and of course I Am I understand ... commercial but the point I wanted to make was that\nAt the time Jackson was actually considered as a moderate on the issue of American indian some people that really really went after him for being as they would have called it an American Indian water\nAnd the reason was because as president as he's really cutting costs cutting the budget which he did very effectively he also was laying out tons of money for the removal of the union for resettlement west there were a lot of people who thought why is Jackson spending money of white people\nSo that read people could settle in these great areas on the great plains\nI it was really sought after land so Jackson at the time so different from the day and as you say we have no war all knew what we left it at the time it was a really complicated issue in Jackson was very worried without question was worried that\nThe whites and blacks would have very very high procreate a birth rates that they were just going to destroy the Indian culture simply by surrounding them in al populating them\nSo removal to the western territories was a way to actually protect the Indian cultures that we used to be thought now the again the execution that that was horrible but his intention I think was generally a good one [noise]\nThat that's fascinating and that's one of the book or is it important book now you don't normally defend him on the Indian issue you have a general defensive Andrew Jackson\n[noise] you know it's one of the things I found so I think we all do that and it's true that Jackson was an incredibly violent man there's just no way around that in every way he was but he also had really certain rules so that violence never ever could be applied to women or children\nThat was the same actually for blacks as well as for Indians in white\nKid a deep respect strangely enough or beautiful enough yet it's strange interesting respect that women are buried deep respect\nTo the point actually he's almost ... times and he treats again Indian women as well as black woman in white wearing very very well but the other thing I found about him so he's got this violence but he's got this ethic that's really interesting but I also found that has been you know counter so many current politicians the guy was just\nUnbelievably honest in everything he did and I think it would have killed his soul to have done something that would have been misleading or dishonest that\nThat's how much of a stickler was about living out this deep deep profound honesty and integrity really quite stunning\nHow did he get the I I ... how did he get his a bullet wound\nOh well somebody at a couple of getting quite a few good things in a number of Jules back he had been a pre teen and then it's seen as a Thirteen year old he thought in the American revolution along with his brother and they had actually been captured at\nJackson during imprisonment and mouth off to a British soldier kicked that that sort of the Hilton it's stored and actually beat in Jackson's goal or even fill it with Jackson died of a dope male ... finger in that ... curies\nAnd it wouldn't be actually even with the rest of the school that's how deep it was that the kind of being ... would never forget by hitting but I'm sure you were thinking\nBy the way it was ...

I think Larry Elder will be here Michael ...\nLast night in Dallas we add Sean Spicer is very good guy\nAnd Larry Elder and\nMore famous anyway it's these are wonderful evenings if you can get in I don't know if you can get in right now I think it's I think it's over but that's why I'm here and it's been intense week as you can imagine every day different city\nBut I have the\nPrager elder med voted in Minnesota okay thank you that's the answer that\nIn life you take the you're going to take the\nThe perspective it's a big factor in my happiness my own happiness and in in my happiness approach and in my book on happiness you\nWith out prospective happiness is impossible there are many things that are necessary for happiness to it's an art happiness really is an art in fact I think there was a book is a book of the art of loving I don't know if there's a book the art of happiness that probably is\nBut it is an art and one of the things necessary for this artistic accomplishment is to have the a a perspective\nAnd I think I mentioned this I I it's hard for me to remember everything that I said for three hours every single day but I think I think I mentioned this just this week\nSo it was in light of this every job comes with difficult parts every job is no such thing as it's not possible to us to ask yourself is it worth it\nIt is the ... is the\nEr the rewards whether financial or or moral or\nEmotional or or so many others is is it worth it I mean if it's not worth it then you have to if possible seek another job\n\nBut it's it's all of life is like that you have to take the bigger picture is if you concentrate on the pain of the moment it's a problem\nSo Megan Kelly is that have been fired from NBC sixty three million dollars or something like that\nAnd I I I did\nNot to knock her I just thought it was not a fan so I'm not saying this because I was a fan I'm saying this because I'm a fan of\n\nOf a a society that has a ... that still retains the notion of safe you made a mistake and you sincerely apologize it's over\n\nShe said something to the effect that we're talking about Halloween costumes and she didn't think they should be politically correct met a white can do looked like a black a black and looked like a white\nAnd\nThen she got fired even though she apologized profusely ... tearfully the next day because of the racist history of blackface of me and I would say\n\nSo that's what the yeah we could play well let's play a short I mean if people should should here this is what the woman lost her livelihood over\n[laughter]\nAnd then you'll get in trouble if you are a white person like that or black or white like I Can't that was okay as long as you address character [laughter]\n\nOkay so if you addressed if you were dressed as a character in other words you addressed as a specific human being\nSo\nYou could say it's foolish you could say it's ... it's insensitive\nTo the history of blackface in America but worthy of losing your livelihood is the punishment especially after and apologies the punishment not\nFar greater than the crime\nA lot so he hears her ears are appalled this painful for me to hear the ... what the left forces it's really like these re education camps and communist countries where the the person ... after ... for the for their life as it were and noting how of terrible they were both here it goes\n[noise] is how I made and Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nWho made her they answered a we had a discussion about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it'll ever okay for a person of one race and drop off a whole nother a black person making their faith later or white person making errors darker can make a costume complaint\nI defended the idea saying as long as it is that was a respectful and part of a Halloween costume uphold okay\nWell I was wrong I Am sorry\nOne of the great types of sitting in his chair instead of getting to discuss different points of view and as I talk to and sometimes I listen I won't say I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface on route ... awful way by racial or control it is not okay for that can be part of al ... who Halloween or otherwise\nWhy didn't end there\nI Believe that that's what she did learn I oh I don't I don't I don't get it\n\nWhy why isn't she forgive him I had ... the a\nCouple of weeks ago on the on the whole issue\nOf forgiveness\nAnd how it's like it's become a a a last item in the United states by the way I think it is an example I Do think I think people\nBecome meaner at in the in in America they have become meaner as they have left religion I Do believe that not every body mother every religious person does kind that every secular person as me okay for those we went to graduate school and don't understand the concept of generalization I gave you the\nInformation but there's no question in this regard that\n'cause it's such a big feature of both Judaism Christianity forgiving the sincere tentative\nAnd ... if you don't think that she was sincere in in her\n... ...\n... then then we'd have a different read of what happened obviously\n\nKnow Abby now I'll give you an example which I totally understand is not analogous I understand that but we remember it's gone crazy because we now talk about cultural appropriation\nWhere a white person can't wear a white man can wear a ... for example a a a a Mexican hat\n\nOr or or I don't know I guess you can't do a Greek than so I don't know I I tend these

mean that that may possibly be given the history there's no such thing as respectful are\nAppearing as a member of another race specifically wide as a black may well be\nRight but it it was it it was so obviously not meant in a racist manner lose your livelihood the next day after apologizing remain replace folks that you can think the left\nI it's like I bring you the meanest that this is the
