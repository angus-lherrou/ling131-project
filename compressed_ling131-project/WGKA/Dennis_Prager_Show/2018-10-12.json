Brecht referendum though I was so called\nPopulist movements in Europe and elsewhere and so I'm really trying to address what I think is going on\nAnd um and what um how leaders business and political but particularly how conservatives should respond to some of them so that is really the essence of the topic and I guess what my niece is in a nutshell\nWhich some people would find surprising I think the populist I'm as they raise these concerns about market in trade and immigration uh globalization that many of their concerns are correct\nAnd that that we have to do a better a job in terms of policy we have to meaningfully respond to be concerned but the way to respond to them through um you know good a good conservative response to conserve the answers\nSo let me ask you the the mainstream maybe which of course is almost synonymous with big on the left around the world has picked all of these\nAs sort of a nation almost fascism in a hurry and in Poland now a Brazil and the United states what is your response to that\nAny anybody who says that really clearly has no understanding of what fascism was\nUm you know the ... the movement which does exist and some corners in some dark circles or the movement from the century Nineteen twenties and I hit thirty it was a very different beat that most of this right wing populism is not to say that in some\nCases there aren't a than some of the extreme there are some similarities but\nUm you know populism uh people you see that on the left I'm liberal media you called mainstream media I call it liberal media that's what it is\nUm [noise] you know they frankly equate anything they disagree with with that that kind of the standard response\nBut populism has a long political tradition populous than on the right left them better and people are people who probably are wrongly are often trying to bring the concern of large math people concerned they believe are being ignored into public debate in public arena\nAnd um I think it's undeniable whether I Want to read for instance with the concerns of\nAre the issues Mr Trump has raised on trade and immigration that matters like that\nThere is no doubt that he is speaking for a large mass of people who are concerned about these policies\nAnd are you familiar I mean I'm sure you are I'd like just a quick take guns hungry and Poland\nYeah look I Try I'm not too I'm a kind of get into talking day to day politics of various member part of the I you know I'm a I you know I Would say obviously in the case of Hungary\nI'm what I've heard of them support for Mr Bond more than anything has been his ... that's been um to illegal um an irregular migration over his board or something that the population supports them on and that the right to support one\nWho so you tell us a little I I was not familiar with this and then I think in the reporting for my listeners to know about the ... the international Democrat union so tell us wanted one is that\nYeah so it was set up a believe it or not it was actually set up in Nineteen eighty three\nAre under the Reagan Administration um the original vice president George W. Bush with the signer of the London Declaration that established the idea of prime minister about your chance circle of Germany a structure Iraq who I Believe was mayor of Paris at the time but the leader of the\nBetter right in France a day and a number of other leaders think it was about thirty five at the time came together to form a global federation of conservative party that has\nThat fairly regularly and the decades that followed very active than had some prominent near the end of the Cold War the leaders obviously coordinated\nTheir policies ah you know a resurgent conservatism coordinated their policies that were often successful and very short order and bringing down the Berlin Wall of the Soviet Empire but the organization has continued to exist and and my vision board is really one where\nIt's sort of active but and operatives really share best practices on campaigning in on governing so we just had a gathering of a hundred representative of our various parties around the world in in Los Angeles recently actually\nSo I here here's something I Would love to get your take on when I think of Canada I\nI think of a to Canada as in many ways the same way I think of America to Americans a left in her right is that is that a a valid perception or not so valid um\nI probably would quarrel with it and at the ... there's no doubt um\nThere's no doubt that in Canada a oh I Know merit many Americans uh conceive of Canada's they have very left wing country I'm In fact\nConservative movements very strong hand as you mentioned I upbringing ten years we just had elections recently where in our two largest province of Ontario and Quebec a right is that our government came to office so\nWe have a significant um conservatism and considerate movement in our country but our country is far less polarized\nAnd kind of what you would call left right camps than the United states are really a remarkably less polarized than part of the reason I wrote the book\nThe trends I talked about in the book the trend of\nYou know very core economic outcomes for a lot of middle and working class people and the political disruption and populist movements we're now seeing they really have not occurred in Canada the same degree\nSo my book is not a book in my book really is about ... from my perspective why some of the lessons and some of the practices we followed in Canada helped the boy some of these challenges and how they can help here the conservative movement in the United states and elsewhere throughout\nThe book ladies and gentlemen is right here right now I'm speaking to the former prime minister of Canada for ten years conservative no less\nAnd the book is up at the dentist Prager dot com right here right now and this man is as you could tell was obviously very thoughtful\nAccount and it's a very important country in the world and we need to know more about it we need to understand for example the worldwide conservative a resurgence I mean it's happening that's what he's explaining [noise]\nNeither every one of you to know that I spoke to our spoke about the Quebec elections\nIt was astonishing talked about it on this on this show [noise] All right everybody I'm Dennis Prager Steven ... book yourself that's Dennis Prager is on home we reserve\nA fairly conservative editorial line unfortunately\nA lot of the day to day reporting in calling this are simply not that bad and in terms of federal federal politics ... which I I Would not today considered the national posed the conservative paper\nIn terms of its day to day coverage in federal politics but its editorial rely line remains relatively consider the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where what an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage\nNowhere to hide it tough yeah you have to do a while you have you have\nDo you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists um\nUm and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states will podcast\nUm you know I think there is a big market candidate for that kind of thing to take off what as I said there is a you know thirty percent of Canadians will always vote right of center at least thirty percent bottom at kind of the uh the low number\nAnd so that that audiences in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur and the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which for the most part has very little and the way of of outlet servicing them\nWhat about young people or\nLet me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me that the polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada is that ... to the same basic\nRights so it was but but on the issues they differ is just as clearly as the left right differ in the United states so is it because the Canadian temperament is just more subdued ... why isn't there that polarization\nI I think it's the fact that you know I I ... I hate the generalization is about our country but it's a fact that Canadians have the more civil public discourse than always have\nUm it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be hard core conservative or heart or left liberal\nWould be much smaller and the percentage of the population that would float between party significantly bigger and Canada ... ... I think the other factor that often forgotten\nWhen people can they can uh when people compare Canadian American politics as we have more than two parties and that really changes the dynamic significantly I always say well you know the strictly two party system you know a candidate a hack candidate B.\nHe can bring candidate the down in a in a system where he got more than two parties there's always a risk the candidate a attack Kennedy be effectively the winner become Kennedy the who's\nNot oh All right listen this has been a great honor the book is right here right now it is helping\nDennis Prager about Tom thank you prime minister [noise]\nAm nine twenty two year term [noise]\n[noise] with us or a news high while I Do with Washington President Trump is celebrating the release of the American pastor who was on trial in Turkey he says he will be back in the U.S soon\nA Turkish court today convicted Andrew Brunson on terror related charges but still released from house arrest and allow him to leave the country that decision is expected to ease trained us turkey\nRelations President Trump's been calling for brunch son's a release for quite some time now for the Senate debate between democratic Senator Bill Nelson and Republican governor Rick Scott has been postponed because of hurricane Michael CNN statement says a live debate that had been planning for Tuesday night\nWill be rescheduled for a later date the statements ... says both campaigns reaches its own way so candidates can focus on response and recovery to the storm and has now been downgraded in heading out over the Atlantic but it's expected to drop heavy rains along the east coast\nAt all street a winning session so far that was up sixty six points this is as however I knew\nI twenty [noise]\nStarted with that I've been in Cobb County acres middle road still close between powers very humbling boulevard from that early morning police in ball shooting incidents still under investigation\nBeautiful friday afternoon a lot of folks sit in the rose early get out for lunch maybe getting off work early some jam packed in downtown on the connector north bound for university trouble clearing their southbound very slow in the mid town on Seventy five eighty five the perimeter a mess both ways on the west side through Smyrna\nOuter loop southbound down the road work in the left leaning hollow well north bound from South cops\nUp dividing setting for Seventy five and sun trust part you can tell the expressway ... especially ... getting down on the big three Seventy five hundred and eighty five approaching the perimeter all extra heavy saying what I twenty on the inbound west expressway coming in from the Six Flags Harry and it's just going to get worse from here I'm Chris Monroe at the traffic command center\nHiring tries zip recruiter unlike most job board zip recruiter finds candidates for you and actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates fast super recruiter the smartest way to hire try it for free and zip recruiter dot com slash joined\n[laughter] ... happy and Miami and rode a horse drawn\nAround\nSettlers thinking now seems really\nNot true band yeah sort of bass parts\nComing up here to screw us helping dedicated to home in Atlanta\nOur ass Andrew ...\nWhich part of this is true ah the wagon horse drawn station wagon backwoods trailer side Dr was a two lane dirt road Derrick okay not ... by two lane why the worry yeah because we need one ... have\nYou not sexy an iron eh we built our seniors delivering smile ...\nHa ha no surprise up from ... tax you can trust clean screen trained and timely every one of the air you go a good story ... be would be prone\nStart ...

changed as possible the parents are no longer married but everything else to the extent possible remains the same\nStability is a key factor and the happiness of the trial\nBut there is a bigger there that's the overwhelming that's the ... the heavy but there was something the single most important thing you can do is not bad about the other parents to the child\n\nThe number of parents who do bad mouth some cases poison children against the other because they're so angry\nIs very large\nUm in most cases I Would consider that evil\nYour anger at the\n... the other parents for divorcing\nIs between you and that person the children should not be part of it\n\n[noise] that's a very painful topic about the if there's not a lot because I ... I enjoyed it is it painful topic because I Know how many people have endured it\n\nWhere kids were act it's cold parental alienation uh syndrome PAAS I Believe\n\nWhere the anger of the parent is so great that they will deprive their child of the other parent because they're so certain about how evil the other parent is going to the fact that the other\nParent divorced them\nIt's a it's a form of selfishness and self centered dish that boggles the mind\n\nThat's a very bad thing the children don't want to take sides\nI have known parents who had every legitimate reason to be ticked off at the other who were aware of tremendous defects in the character and parenting of the other parent I've kept their mouths shut\n\nThey've been said one bad word about that other parents these people of a special place in heaven I'm tempted to say that The Poisoner's of children have a special place in hell\n\nThat's a very big guideline there's another big guideline\n\nDon't spoil your child because you're guilty but you divorced\n\nThose are my two big guidelines don't poison the child against the other parents\n\nAnd don't spoil the child because you're so guilty I see I see a or you could see

that it will go as close to ensuring the child's happiness and healthy development is anything\n\nThe child wants you to stay his or her father or his or her mother\n\nIf Iraq with guilt over the divorce and spoil the child the new of spoil the child spoiled people are not happy people\n\nEntitled people are not happy people people whose parent isn't the parents are not happy people\nEvery guard rail has to remain up your ... you still make demands on your child in terms of behavior is is how you act\nAnd you you don't have a competition between the two parents about who can buy them more goodies and give them a more elaborate birthday party\nFor the record I see no point in elaborate birthday parties I Am convinced that overwhelmingly what animate them as competition with

...\nWell so okay well the youngest son is obviously not an older child\nOh no I have some I have a lot of false on this question and one of them is just for people to think about people who stay together for the sake of their children do will divorce after they graduate high school or will divorce after they graduate college\nOr it doesn't seem to work out quite as they think and in many instances precisely for what you point out that it really a\nHas emotionally affected them even in college or after college is that your point\nOh yeah and even into adulthood and even into adulthood OK yes okay so I'm gonna just use this to say a few words and I thank you for your call\n\nThis is a very uh uh it's a very interesting topic and one that I'd I'd like to have some therapists on the

half hour is devoted to\nWhat was written about me and the Colorado State university paper where this guy made up three things that I said I never I never said any of them or anything close to them he of course he didn't have any source that wasn't even quotes\nThe that bothers me\nNew York times lied about what I said and then that was picked up by the entire media and now they all put it in quotes because the recordings in New York Times which never quote it'd be so works and molest\n[noise] okay every body it's a one a Prager seven seven six\nAnd let's go to your calls\nA we begin with Kevin in Cleveland Hi Kevin Cleveland\nIdentify that part was the top yeah thank you\nWould have thoroughly respect everything to do so much for your ... well You're welcome\n[laughter] um my one question or I guess I got on them but I guess the one on top of my mind is a ... if\nWe do have an advice for honoring a parent who's withdrawn or not really interested in being involved with me and my family that kind of stems back to divorce issues and what you're talking in the past our um\n... or I guess residual effects from a divorced childhood um but I guess in starting a new family started over what's my mom has done the same and she has a totally different experience but I'm with him I don't know if it's more\nWhere I got me going to get rid of trying to understand something so he that your parents divorced and then he withdrew from you\nOr I guess not not necessarily or not\nI I'm not ... but\nThey're like oh you're having started new families both of them my father is more kind of involved with a new you know it is my wife\nRight so I did so why so why summarized you accurately you're saying that he withdrew from you because he became preoccupied with the new guy like oh it seems that way so you're asking how old are you\nHonor him 'cause I'm a big one on honoring parents in almost every case so I don't know so\nMy my biggest one day I Believe about okay well that's my biggest example of honoring parents staying in communication if they don't if they are a ambivalent or if they are recalcitrant are hesitant\nYou have to do what you have to do\nSo uh you you you make you make periodic calls or you send an email just checking in if they don't want to respond they didn't you we have to do the right thing and again this is this is my single biggest example of why I Believe people need religion\nPeople for me to be told on or your father and your mother because of God wasn't behind that\nA lot of people would not honor their parents so since God told me the honor my parents are unless it is an extraordinary situation of pure evil on their part I have to do that how they respond is their business whether I honored them is my business\nYeah I've heard of a a one sided relations\nYou're right so what is so you know what they said you send email and that's it\nYou you will be able to uh have a peaceful life after your parent is gone you did your best you will have no guilt feelings I don't know what it costs you to periodically get in touch it's not a big deal\nOr if there's no positive reinforcement then there's no positive reinforcement my father called his mother every night she yelled at him every night\nHe put the phone on the kitchen table I hear her yelling at him you pick up the phone and go yeah ma yam up put it back down and eat and he had absolutely no guilt feelings after she left this world\n[noise] okay [noise] okay All right\nThank you You're welcome it's either this is the beauty of of\nFeeling that that ... the almighty has the creator of the earth has told me what to do it doesn't say on or your parents provided they respond provided they're nice\n[laughter] you don't need it command to honor nice parents [laughter] that's that's the whole point it's on or your father and mother even if they're twins in fact if you add up the Hebrew word for father and the Hebrew word for twit there you\nGo you know because you had letters in Hebrew letters all have a numerical equivalent that they go I'm kidding about that with them parrot brother was a joke okay but\n... that's that's the whole point is is this the power of solar I'll make go they go a little ad for myself please get the rational Bible it'll change your life I promise if you read the book will I promise\nI'm explaining the greatest book it it means to be explained care if you're an atheist it's called the rational\nBug [noise] so okay I'll leave it at that ah let's\nSee here thank you Kevin is an important thing and let's go to Andy in Chandler, Arizona Hi Andy\nKohut and that's a prayer at the top here again\nThank you um I question\nSo my son can garden and we're going to Catholic school when I went to twelve years a Catholic school so I Know how the discipline is and I appreciate that he recently\nI don't know how to approach my my son's teacher because I'm On a break you aren't we took a boy's hand and put it over his crotch with clothes on\nWhat I'm Sorry I Can't wait who did this to your son\nNow my son took a boy and\nAn old your it's like so your son took a boy's hand and put it on his crotch on your son's clash okay\nAnd so he was put in um eras suspended yesterday right and I'm ... initial meeting with the teacher and you know she said we're lucky that other parents didn't want to press charges [laughter] I just\nI don't know how to follow up so why why okay so how old is your son\nSit right in kindergarten\nRight okay I got you so uh\nWhen you asked your son why did you do it why did he say\nThat they were looking for a marker under a table and there were a bunch of it looking for the marker and he just\nHe just didn't really have an explanation\nFor why it was like a joke it was soon yeah yeah I don't I don't think it was a sexual act\nI don't think so and they never done\nAny ... like All right well I Want to want to look I'm happy the school didn't suspend them [noise] ah it's a it's we live in a paranoid age in this regard today as Alan Dershowitz put in sexual McCarthyism\nI certainly will ponder that I I don't know that I I agree with that but I Will\nCertainly don't know exactly anyway the issue is not even agreement the issue is us how does the juicy it you know ... on on matters of face\nOr you know I always say if I don't I don't expect agreement and then it's not even a significant to me so so so there's different ... but the ... it's the values that's why we speak of Judeo Christian values not Judeo Christian theology\nI agree but I guess it is the book of Isaiah for example divinely inspired\nWhere God Speaks to why they are it is just as much God as\nSpeaking in the Torah but\nBut where you have other statements that it doesn't say and God said so then it's as I said like proverbs or Rick sleazy Estes that is not from God\nOkay that's a that's a hell for clarification of a difference is that I I understand that\nGood God Bless you and I mean it thank you so much ... ski and Kevin in North Hollywood, California Hi\nYes yes Hi Dennis\nI have a question for you yes okay so yesterday [noise] um you had mentioned the ads with laughter is
