might go on line that I cook for a few is just a few seconds but um it gives you an idea of how quickly this thing unfold and I was at a Burger King you know try to lose weight and you might say why\nAre you in a Burger King Gallagher\nI saved up all my points wanted to have a a sandwich at Burger King went to the one right across from the Port Authority on forty second street in Manhattan which is very dangerous that block happens to be a very dangerous part of Manhattan It's just in fact I think I read somewhere it's still literally the most dangerous\nArea of New York city or Manhattan rather by its location in just those two blocks a lot of homeless people there was a really really scary people and one of those scary people walked into the Burger King I'm sitting there by the table at the table by the window minding my own business reading a book\nLike a dummy sip it on my Diet Coke 'cause the Diet Coke always offsets the whopper it's the way it works in my mind anyway the guy walks in the sky shovels and and he starts bothering people who are standing by one of the kiosks\nAnd I can hear one of the the the people the customer say step away from me don't touch me don't touch don't put your hands on me\nAnd the guys mumbling something black he's like in a black a sweat like a black track suit and ... you can put this video up on the streams of people and see how this story because at this point the security guard for Burger King comes over\nAnd he's asking the guy politely I heard the whole thing is it's just a few feet away from me you got to leave now buddy you've got to go\nWith that guy pulls out the scariest looking nights it looked like a home made like a shank all I've I've seen at the movies like is what prisoners make when they try to kill somebody\nAnd then the security guy gets enraged the guy pulled a knife on it so he picks up a chair\nAnd the videos that were going to post your that were posted right now is Mike online dot com if you happen to watch this and I realized over the weekend I was showing like the video to my friends I thought oh my gosh I can show it to my audience Monday if you if you're by computer and you're you're watching the show the live stream anyway\nThe guy picks up the search hole in the chair over his head screaming you're going to pull a knife on me you're going to end this\nWill they get to the front door now the reason I put my phone down at that point was because they were like white\nTwo feet away from me three feet away from me and I thought this guy's got this knife in his hand if he sees me with the camera\nHe may step me like I don't I don't want to die on the floor of the Burger King across from the Port Authority on a Saturday Night by myself if that is the status thing um you know my in my life has said enough as it is anyway would they got to the front door which is right where I was at the front of the Burger King\nThis guy with the knife who had been shuffling and mumbling and just you know like he was out of it like he was on he starts thrusting this knife at the security guy with a baseball cap on and he's plunging it at him and thrust into that I'm\nA I'm not kidding you he turned into a ninja warrior\nI've never seen somebody for stealing a deadly weapon like this so quickly he is throwing ... and ...\nAnd this guy and it was one of the most terrifying things I've ever witnessed because I thought this guy's gonna get killed\nBut those security guard and of course he's not ... ... ... ... I'm holding back he's swinging the charity the guy he slammed at one point the glass door is the injuries on the guy's face\nThey're going at it on the sidewalk finally the the the the guy with a knife went away I guess\nI called nine one one police showed up in about three or four minutes God Bless the NYPD too great officers popped out of the crews are I don't know what happened there was no follow up\nBut I share all this with you know in the police officers are risking their lives it's a police officers had been there at the scene with this guy thrust into nice the way he was like I said like a ninja warrior\nI'm telling you they would have had to shoot this guy right on the spot right on the spot it was that ... there's no way to stop this\nAnd it is a ... a reminder of the of the jeopardy the police officers put their lives in every day I get tired of hearing police officers vilified and it's why I Hope you'll support\nOur our foundation because we will help the families of these officers in Mississippi were going to help the white family where to help the ... family were helping the family in Kansas we're going to we help we assist your donations assist the families of police officers who have been killed in the line of duty that a text message from a\nRetired lieutenant of from the NYPD who said Mike you have no idea no one has any idea how quickly\nAnd how fatally a sharp edged weapon can can be for a police officer and the way this guy\nThe way this guy was plunging the knife\nAnd and doing it so quickly and ... with rushed that I'm not ...

A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R. which many of you've done over the years and I appreciate that fact or you can also keep in touch with me on Facebook or Twitter at the Marcus for show\nAnd if you check those sites you'll find out where else I appear besides filling in for Dennis [noise]\nAlthough I must admit I intentionally used Facebook and Twitter much less about that we know they're biased right and what what's the point I mean [laughter] they'll go to print what they want right or at least the loud to appear [noise]\nI'm In this hour I Want to talk about the disgraceful list that has occurred in the nomination process for judge Kavanaugh\nAnd what it all means for me and you and for America\nFirst of all let's skip the straight if you don't already know it left\nLiberals Democrats whatever you want to call them ... ... it's about the same to me these days [noise] yeah I Know Dennis has a distinction they will do anything and everything to when\nThey have no limits and they have no guard rails as to what is acceptable\nThis isn't even the ... Ronald Reagan I don't know if you remember he would have drinks with the speaker Tip O'Neill years ago obviously and at night and he said and what we were were friends what's going on in the daytime I said that's the daytime when he fought them tooth and nail\nNow of course you can't have a drink anymore because that is now disqualifying if you were on the right\nIt has become all out war anything and everything goes\nNow line has come in a place like you know with a Senator Harry Reid and write Romney's taxes someone told them that even pay taxes and later on he said well you know it was effective right that's the issue is that affect not if it's true\nOr the total insanity of the charge that Kavanaugh was part of a group allowing for women to be gang raped or not gang rape the least about what they're doing standing in line they orchestrate that supposedly so much so that even the New York times wouldn't print that accusation but\nAll of it is fair game any after ... is to be treated seriously if it is made by someone on the left against someone on the right those are the rules so the salt that Keith Ellison I think he's running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota He may very well have made against his girlfriend\nIs running for attorney general the best of matter it'll boost safely showers telling me attorney general it it doesn't matter to solve the debt against his girlfriend if he did this but he's on the left\nAnd maybe even more telling he's a Muslim which if you didn't know isn't exempt group these new rules only are for those on the right\nThe ends justify any means we're evil and they are right check that correct\nBut I never want to be called right but that's all that matters and there is no issue of whether they can go to sleep at night but you know ... care because they know they're doing God's work\nIf even believe in God their God is more likely to be the God of left us or an anti conservatives are anti Republican isn't that is their religion\nAnd it doesn't matter who they destroy and there is no negotiating with these people it is their way or the highway I have trouble watching their lives in this past week even though you know it's the talk show host to she have to watch that circus\nThey didn't really care about that woman not really she was yes senator Booker I Would have said to you she was used as a pawn because because those on your side wouldn't have ignored a conservative woman with the same charges against a left this man you were using her\nAnd your accomplices of course in the media would barely cover it\nNeed I mentioned Kathleen Willie Paula Jones Anita Broderick the list actually goes on and on those women women sorry weren't on the left so it doesn't matter\nThey're just road kill on the way to power I wrote Sean I learn roadkill in Texas that's that's a phrase that there be Juanita broader gray right right\nThey actually hypocrisy of people like Cory Booker talking about sexual molestation\nI'm surprised they didn't have another Spartacus moment wasn't that at a sporting his feet and he admits sexual misbehavior or the self righteousness of Kamala Harris or the other phone is on the panel they talk about taking the high moral ground\nNice hypocrites have actually reach new lows who loaned the moral high ground every time I can think they go you know they can't get any lower than this they break new ground\nTell me that's my first question to you how you were able to contain herself I Won a prayer seven seven six\nThese people's disgust me I Can't watch or listen to them in fact when I did was I was teaching part time and so every time a Democrat got and I knew I had to listen but I kind of word this up a little bit I I it's hard to take it's really hard to take\nKavanaugh was not even my first choice by the way to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered\nIf the pope was Trump's nominee and he's left us make no mistake about it they wouldn't have been against him it doesn't matter if Trump appointed in ... by the way what the heck did they need hearings or future FBI investigations when they know how they're going to vote they already know\nAnswer to suffering people like Jeff Flake\nTalk about being name correctly you know as soon as I heard his name I have some doubts he said if you remember you would vote for Kavanaugh and hysterical woman confront him and he admits that was part of the reasons he was for an additional FBI investigation can you believe that\nJeff Flake is a fool this delay will not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats it will further divide us this is all a show to delay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham hadn't just right\nAnd this is all about power and I and all of us probably could take more easily if they just what they felt but they're a bunch of phony hypocrite left us who disgust me tell me what you think of wanting Prager seven seven six but it's worse than that\nBecause we now have taken away one of our most basic rights\nThe presumption of innocence you can charge anybody with any crime you want and you don't even need to have corroborating evidence it doesn't matter if they are innocent you can still ruin their lives\nAnd there are no consequences for the accusers because it's very difficult you have to prove that they did it with mouse\nDo you remember Ronald Reagan's secretary of labor I think his name was a sector Donovan when asked\nAfter he was found innocent as some charges I don't remember the charges anymore after he was found innocent they said to me about where would you go next to what are you gonna do now and he said something like where do I go to get my reputation back\nExactly where ... tell me those judge Kavanaugh will go to get his reputation back\nIt's gone now at least for a lot of people the Democrats and the left have ruined his reputation and some like Feinstein had the nerve to question his belligerence and demeanor at the hearings what was he supposed to do Senator Feinstein after you helped destroyed his life\nAct ever so serene as you ruined his life and his life of his family\nAnd his dentist has pointed out where is his bank account for all the good work is done for all these years\nHow did Bill Clinton by the way stay as president after what he did with the complexity of views Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate this was not a good week for American I Want to know what you think that one a prayer seven seven six and I can see the borders are already filled but you know I I go to calls pretty fast\nNow we're going to get close to break but as for Christine Ford do I think she was attacked yes she appears credible in that regard of I read some by Dr Thomas old saying don't confuse the motion with the facts so yeah she was emotional unbelievable but are you know heart may be getting in the way\nBut to judge Kavanaugh commit that attack I doubt it very much especially since no one can corroborate her story she doesn't know how she got there how she got home when it was exactly by the way why don't you tell the others at the party\nOr anyone else for decades for that matter\nTo you know did she was she allowing a friend to be may be right by those boys also\nI mean there are a lot of inconsistencies in this stuff are not inconsistent questions so now we've reached the stage where oh you need or allegations so I think it was this was running hundreds of people from now on making accusations installing every nomination they don't want\nAnd really everybody's reputation in the process now now there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accused accused and accuse it's a new democratic strategy that has now worked I Wonder what you\nThink at one aide Prager seven seven six I can say you're just as unhappy as I Love you know ... Thanks Mark guys sitting in for Dennis pressure\nThe dentist predator show from the relief factor pain or used to be [noise]\nDifferent than the other thing that I wanted to mention is and I've not heard anyone say that um when they asked her about her friend Leland and if she would cut from there um she she talked about the present well she's got some health issues and I'm going to respect their health issues I'm thinking about this as a former fourteen year old girl\nEven before cellphones next we'll end what are called her and said well you know what happened yeah she is I can remember ensure eight miles from home\nWell I should get home one of my friends didn't\nShe didn't she tell her that she was reading or at least give her a call and say you know what happened after I left or any of those kind of things that get very little oil but you're holding her testimony that I Wish someone had jumped on it\nWere you disappointed in the prosecutor also asking those questions I didn't you think like I did this is going to reach a climax and\nI did and I kept thinking yeah I mean you know when it came to the new break and then she was done my heart sank because I thought boy oh boy after his father after they\nGo you know you were done for\nAnd I was so proud of Brett Kavanaugh when he came in ... and and anybody that you know make fun of him are crying or for bringing up his daughter paid I guess for ... ... what would you not do it you were accused of something so horrific\nWell yeah and but you can't prove a negative well of course and you can't win because if you've been calm they would have said well he was accused of all these sort of you to do but now ... and the other St Louis to delivered to be a justice if she can't win with them that that's the point you did it well ...\nThanks Ukraine culture you you can't win with them how could you win was um it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what the truth is\nCan't win with these people's people's people's thank you mark six that let's see some other great calls let's go to um well we're going to hit that break Amy ah this was just this could be brief in Columbus ohio you're on was marked kind of hard time hearing\nYou need high I just wanted to make the point really crack 'em I just saw the other day I'm not sure whether it happens or not\nBut one thing I think if I was in ...\nI Would be focused on the person that was the opposite of what was going on in the lap pool laughter or whatever she said let's go word I was so terrified for girls that I Would focus for a PRP and that was on top of\nUm one hundred percent so um but the other thing was quick I Can't I Can't remember where I thought but\nWell I'll do it for just ... minutes after I Do say they set up and go find me a cap and I think they did let me know what you think when a predator seven seven six mark I suffered in the spring I\n\nAm now twenty dancer\nWith us or a news on ... avenue\nIn Washington only a press conference at the White House defending his Supreme Court nominee judge Brett covered capital he says he is empowering the FBI to investigate according to the dictates of the Senate Judiciary committee\nLast week it was Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Jeff flake of Arizona defending move holding off the full Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for about a week\nAnd the president just minutes ago announcing what do you call it truly historic trade deal replacing NAFTA deal that will send some new trade guidelines when both Mexico and Canada both leaders have this week to meet with President Trump\nOn Wall street right now it would appear investors like that new trade deals without Jones dusty will average is booming it's up by two hundred and three points at twenty six thousand six hundred and sixty one of the high tech NASDAQ also doing well and so by twenty five ... five hundred of about fifty more details that are news dot com\n\nI twenty\n... years or afternoon\nTraffic that date please ... than we do have some lane blockage from an earlier this morning involving I\nWill try and dumped over the cow's ... said the rams to do anything he founded ...

[noise]\nYeah but what's what's your point I thought you had a [noise]\nI mean I just think it's funny that she would put that wall but like air to believe that that would be in [noise] why she wanted in her statement something back in the gas and oil white carpet when he was even in the\nWell but he was a ... as a federal judge you know the circuit court whenever they call that the the district court he was being considered for that previously so maybe that's why she brought up\nThat you know even the whole thing with the ... you know so many years later they're going to come back and attack you so her answer would be let me defend her now that she was so traumatized by this whole incident that that that's the result that many years later\nSo Grand Turk posted it on my own in Connecticut very specific Nineteen eighty judge Kavanaugh so that's another lie neither why was she was flying out there with a razor wire and well that's what she and her husband fly all over the world but that was another line\nBut never lie was hide the fact that her brother\nHas a relationship with Peter\nI'm\nIt put a little bit below but only three people were low so I think that that needs to be investigated as\nYou know there's an awful lot about the woman that was very\nEmotional I Know that women really relate to the emotional testimony mhm and they find it hard to back away from it but it was not that\nYou did you hear about actual since we're not done Karen did you hear the code ice a paraphrase what Thomas duck Thomas ... said that you can't confuse the motion with facts right she was really good on that emotional level right and and a lot of women especially but others related to that but you just said\nIt but that has nothing to do necessarily with it being factual Carol ... go go to your job now okay\nI Will\nGo but his shoulders are saying to me that people are so\nAffected by this or even the President Trump doesn't seem to be ... you guys are said oh no see what happens is a\nGood man is a fine man but this was really upsetting since the OJ Simpson trial maybe were struck I was on for Larry Elder one day when the the strict testimony happening I mean this is really hitting people hired by the way the response to all this is you got to come out and so you got to come out and such big numbers\nThat it it makes a huge difference just not enough just is it's great that you know give me a chance to express your feelings about what we we can't let these people get away with it and since I mentioned Sondra in Florida go ahead sundry your honor was mark\nJust scratch\nA radio on so that's a delay are you there sundry okay I got to chew on hold because it's going to really make you crazy if you listen to the radio a jak in Annapolis, Maryland Jack you're on with mark ... guess\nMark thank you sir a there's a point that seemed to be being I'm not talked about and that was at the beginning of the questioning of Dr Ford she was asked her how she found out about the party and she said that there was a pool boy attendant or a friend that was at the pool and told her about it\nAnd and she ended up uh you know going from that information\nShe was asked who the person was\nThen she said she wanted to keep that person anonymous\nWell I think that's a key point from the fact that there's an individual out there who can tell who held the party and we're the party was because that person told Ford weren't was\nNow I understand in an annuity but this is very important point we have someone who she identified who she not willing to say who it is who can place or at the party and back on her ... who held the party\nYeah I'd I missed that part I was probably teaching moments but if that happened I it seems significant to me if you have someone who can ... your story at least place you they're right and in fact maybe he knows when that happened were happens a lot better than she does right that doesn't exactly everyone seems\nTo be focusing on how she got home but I think we need to focus on how she identified that part who while we're the party was and who wasn't there seem to be an individual who told her exactly that information who we shouldn't be able to find out who it was then cocaine corporate the whole thing or cannot\nYou know what's really scary Sean\nThese guys are doing a better job with the questioning Mitchell's player I mean you guys are asking and stuff I mean some of it may be a little off there but\nUh I I I thought that was fair game also and the ... one of my friends of Tennessee said to me something about how did she she said she could people couldn't hear but yet she heard them laughing there are so many things that\nOne could have asked her about it maybe would have caught her in the inconsistencies but

I Would be back\nIn my memory she said that he thinks she remembered that she read it off of the paper every time she would go to date I think he looked at her lawyer now with the ... point paper and

I. S. L. E. R. at AOL dot com Dennis will be back tomorrow which may have you done over the years and I appreciate that very much\nAnd you can also keep in touch with me on Facebook or Twitter at the ... show\nAnd you'll find out where else Cy pure besides Phil against a dentist or Larry or whatever in the last star talked about the Supreme Court the Kavanaugh nomination hearings and how despicable many of the Democrats and the left were and are in many of you ... they they're all trying to get two and a little bit I just want to for some other ideas out to you\nI Want you first to consider the importance of a quote that my one of my brothers share with me from our second president John Adams\nHere's the quote is more important that innocence be protected and then it is that guilt be punished\nFor guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished but if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned\nPerhaps to die than the critics will say whether I Do good or whether I Do evil is immaterial for innocence itself is no protection and such an ideas that\nWere to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end up security whatsoever that's partially what's taking place that's uncalled by the way\nThe Democrats I threw out there know what their unleashing do they care they're destroying one of the basic tenants of our republic the presumption of innocence they are asking for trouble they're also asking for trouble if they want to go back to high school and check everybody's teenage years\nWho among us is so proud of those years and where's the bank account of thirty five years if he even committed what he's accused of as a teenager I thought we at least the left\nI thought they believed in redemption and they get the left that wants people to be forgiven even those who commit capital offense but now the teenage years are in play and maybe soon part of that the junior high years\nAnd by the way I Believe you confess to some sexual assault ... senator Cory Booker during those years how come you were still in the Senate\nAnd I thought Joe Biden plagiarized while he was in college how come he was vice president\nAnd senator cotton tweeted senator watch this I knew about this but here's the tweet senator Blumenthal lied for years about serving in Vietnam which is all you need to know about his courage and honesty maybe he should reconsider before questioning judge Kavanaugh's credibility\nEven the New York times reported that this is me now Blumenthal has said he served in Vietnam when in fact as the times when in fact sort of at least five military deferments and eventually landed a spot in the marine reserve where he used was ... was officially guaranteed not to serve in the conflict itself\nSenator Blumenthal ask Kevin off he was familiar with I mispronounced the Latin false and you know false us in on the bus which is a legal principle that dictates jurors can rule a witness to be false and everything if he says one thing that is not true [noise]\nExcuse me senator Blumenthal but that does that also apply to you or do you have a six different now for lying\nI watch these hearings and I felt like I was living in an alternate universe tell me if you felt the same way if you're on the other side of I'll take your view and the other side I Want to get calls from people who disagree\nWhy it all makes sense do you want to prayers seven seven six now another thing I Want you to considers this in my home state of California I suggested on Facebook\nThat Senator Feinstein deserves consequences for her to push city and Republicans should vote for her opponent who may be further less than she is like knowledge that my brother another brother suggested this to me because what difference will make whether a leftist is replaced by a far left as\nI remember years ago comedian Mort Saul said that voters are often given a choice between Tweedle dum and Tweedle dum are now it's much less innocent than that and what's the big difference between a choice between left and far left\nOne at least he's telling you where they stand and going for the kill all at once and the other is a phony torturing you slowly but surely that Senator Feinstein California's going down the tubes anyway so why don't we let them get their quicker I live here so we might be able to pick up the pieces sooner some day\nOr maybe if they as they try to do they can succeed and form their own Venezuela here\nOr member Governor Brown thinks global warming is the biggest issue we face and he is the sworn enemy of President Trump\nSo let them go to their left his utopia and let's get the pain over with what do you think of that idea let's get Republicans to vote for senator finds things far left opponent and give her some consequences for her to push city tell me what you think of that I did too\nPrayer seven seven six it's time we realize we're in a civil war with the left for the soul of this country\nSo then you can tell me what you think ... at the phone number that I just mentioned to you and just listening if you you didn't hear the first hour the emotions the outrage that this was capture to the American people like nothing else I don't think maybe since the OJ Simpson trial because maybe your people out there starting to realize what we're in\nThat the lie and they'll do anything to destroy somebody\nAlright I promised I go to your calls so let's go to Tom has been waiting forever Tom England or you're on with mark\nMarket is great to hear you substituting so superbly for that is like and talk to you again I really miss your old Saturday Night show a few killer down the dial\nWhen you you got to ... because I Do other stuff too so just to see where I Am okay\nWhat phase me mark from the depression or my two precious three and five year old granddaughter is for the and had a I tell you I I don't totally nuts without without those we arts\nBark when you call Jeff Flake a fool there's only one thing wrong you're insulting fool [laughter] ah I read serious note that Democrats have fallen into such an arm Beagle relieve ugly scary\nInfinitely deep moral up is when you disagree with your hey there no matter what\nThey foster would constantly they this day the constitution way hey the free market and personal with them we know that in the socialist state of California and they are lovers\nOf socialism which is the government crushing people in the most viable way just look at those away law and mark\nMy theory is if we don't vote them out as you suggested we must\nThey will get a stranglehold almost in perpetuity on Supreme Court they will do anything they can to push their freedom killing socialist agenda and the future of this country as the once great\nVast you bring them that our founding fathers created will be forever gone\nThanks Tom and you said a very well I can I can feel free to say this Bill Clinton's line I can feel the pain out there it is it's obvious and let's go to a I like Josh in San Antonio is question or comment gun Josh\nHi taking my call sure\nYou know I just wanted to basically say that ah you know in my own reaction in any way to the testimony early or testimony which is I think a Republican may have gone at it a little bit\nWrong angle I think maybe that they won't when you come up you can't really question anybody's memory without coming off a little bit ... especially in a time of uh one of the victim you're talking about budget they that they should have basically just said hey we understand that\nYou're that you're you've been going through a rough time and they must have happened to you and your incredible were not questioning that at all I think that what they should have done it that\nIf the if there was a terrible situation where somebody brought you evidence or brought you in a in a legit accusation but had no evidence what would you do and then giving her that options you would have no chance\nOther than to say that what happened is that it requires corroborating evidence in order to destroy somebody's life if they could have gone around to that then they could have been like that we need your help to bring some evidence that there is any evidence\nAnd then from there you wouldn't have been accused of not remembering\nI'd like your style that's that that would've been a good way to do it unless you may have different or lawyers who knows and they would have had some objections saying she's not here to answer that kind of a question I don't know you never know what but by like your approach thanks a lot of trash\nAnd I knew you had a good comment there let's go uh let's continue the inquisition in some ways even though you know how I feel Jan in Marietta, Georgia you're on was mark\nHey mark thanks for taking my call sure\nJust real quick ... one of the thing there are many things but I I think that I thought for a doctor forward and her testimony but one really important thing was\nWhen she picked like after they decided that attack 'em that she saw a judge\nA friend that within the room and did not help her and laugh hysterically about what what's going on\nAnd she said when she saw him he was very uncomfortable when she said hello what in the age girl\nOkay we'll give you a little question mark I slept for them as for\nThe courage is not there there's flake cause someone\nA costume or wherever it was an elevator on the floors of the Senate whatever and starts yelling at him he admits that was part of his decision to\nSuggest that we have a another week of the stuff I mean we're we're as the courage Democrats would give them credit for one thing they circle the wagons and they fight for their own and they know the battle or in that's been the problem with the Republicans do you really know\nWhat we're up against for them this is war this is their religion this is their God for many of them a lot of them probably do believe in God that's not my point\nI'm just trying to say this is everything to them who gets on the Supreme Court because they've been using it to legislate\nAnd I understand why you're so unhappy a someone says something about the left and I are maybe they dropped off had been waiting over an hour but let's go to Trisha in Denver, Colorado Colorado Tricia you're on with mark\nHi Trisha I think we\n... we neither of them are desirable and and our personal stake ought to accept the ... miles an hour is relative to what tools drinking party and the behavior that happened there even irrelevant get all we were to Frank ensure that\nThere can be no\nFor an hour walk and chew on a time period liquor back World War on when yeah that's it period that

went over they don't have courage they're afraid of their own shadow that's that by the way that was one of the reasons President Trump is so enduring that so many people yeah it gets himself in trouble with his tweets\nPlaces like the first person to really stick up for what he believes in any you can't push 'em down you know and cut them off\nOr any actually says what he means kept himself in trouble a lot of times but isn't that what makes them so in theory that well we've been crying out for instead of these mushy Republicans and and a little ... Collins of Maine and Merck cash ski of ah the Alaska\nAnd I mentioned in Sean just reminded me and Ann Romney goes ahead and says I support this week to hit us exactly why Romney lost I was going to mention that the we're we're ...\nWe're they're willing to do battle see the Democrats get this the left gets it and we don't\nWe're Denis says it all the time we're in a new war might be civil let's hope it stays in a sense that now there's no bloodshed although I worry about that very much when I listen to your emotions I listened to the emotions of the other side\n[laughter] scary where it's come where you could just make allegations and that's it and you could ruin someone's life tell me what you think mark I suffer desperate [noise]\nTwenty theater\n[noise] was as a news eyeball I knew in Washington\nPresident Trump says he's not at all top of the Congress will approve his revised North American trade deal he says Democrats will have a twenty twenty those races by what they\nMight not want to give her approval what he calls all the deals for the American people you laid it out today the White House or do you deal he says with Canada and Mexico there's much more fair that NAFTA which is about to replace\nConstructing a construction is better get aboard ever so slightly of the month of August housing market in general is a big damp with a bit by higher mortgage interest rates which are meant to\nStimulate the economy but could make it harder for some people to borrow the money they need to buy a whole autopsies were player today on the bodies of three people found that after car explosion of downtown treated Allentown, Pennsylvania over\nThe weekend of all street right now the dial up two hundred and sixteen this is Sri ...\nI Want to address\nThe Monday deal years or afternoon traffic ... dealing with ... from the earlier stipulation near the ... release after hearing dad's in the south\nRash those ... they're still trying to wrangle up the rest of them was like an estimated another hour for the ... you sound ramp you I Seventy five will be blocked off there so continue to avoid that when I when he found dealing with a stall\nAs you had to warn you eighty five it's right before folding dash grill and daisy math right now that I'm going to check on that forecast for the night and we had a friend that traffic command center I'm Brittany kind Peter here\nWe are the first day of October and you still may not have your home ready to show that that's OK I'm parks with mark Spain he's got your solution\nSupports one of our clients allegedly had a property over in Cobb County your attendance and moved out she needed to sell the property she worked full time\nRather than work fulltime I didn't really have a lot of time to get the house and and show condition she reached out and said hey you know mark really interesting you're guaranteed offer programs that are out of the property that an analysis on it presented her an offer she was elated closing twenty two days\nAnd for all cash with no showing no staging the game she Asians maybe that's your situation and you have a rental property you need to sell or maybe it's your home with the kids renting in and out and all the things that you have to do that getting it ready to sell is not on the list sell your home with mark Spain real estate's guaranteed offer\nCosts seven seven eight eight six nine thousand and log on to mark Spain dot com slash guaranteed offer marks thing dot com slash guaranteed offer certain restrictions apply\nUm ...

might be out there let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania you're on was mark\nAnd mark I got to have you heard that the Republican Senator Byrd lacking ferrets I grew up on\nIn this hour you can continue to call but I thought I Would have some political experts on to give us their take on where this is all going and what it means for the upcoming elections as well as for the future of the Republican\nThere Sean steel Republican committee men from the former great state of California you can't say that but I and an artist Steinberg political consulting pollster and writer of whiplash from JFK to Donald Trump a political odyssey\nWill gentlemen I don't even know where to begin the callers are still there but did the parents have been accused of surprise you even in the first place Arnie\n... you know if I if there were the vast right wing conspiracy which I was the head when she came forward to\nThat she would have been ... dismissed but of course it would have been pre suppose you with the Democrats were also liberals like Alan Dershowitz simply would have said\nLook if I were Dianne Feinstein and she weren't interested in the blood sport of gutting this nominee a while we her mid eighties is her final swan song there\nWhen this letter came to me the staff would have looked interview per say look if you want to be anonymous and there isn't any cooperation there is a long time ago this doesn't come across threshold for me to pursue and I wouldn't be the end of it\nAnd aren't speaking of Dianne Feinstein center ... did you I don't know if you heard me suggests that Republicans and you're the national committee men for public after Republican Party in California that maybe we should vote for her opponent so there's some consequences for what she's doing what she did the top two primary system\nIs another unique the listeners should know that other disasters shining teacher at California that you're allowed to vote for two people doesn't matter\nOnly two people ah who get the highest number of votes regardless of party affiliation we have no primaries any more minor parties have disappeared in California so not consequently we get one crazy Democrat too far left wing ... Democrat\nAs our only choices for us I Know we can't even ride in a terrible idea Democrat activists say the Republican activists have that certain rest abolition folks love it and it and so what we have is a dying Feinstein or as as a left wing opponent and Sean steals not gonna vote for either one I Can't even right in\nWhat about what about mark suggest maybe ... people are so upset I tell you this idea of felt like going to measure the Feinstein campaigned Bill Carrick who I've known for many years and say you know\nWhat you're going to have those is the average Republican voter the average Republican do that's what we should just get it doesn't know the Kevin de Leon her opponent is more left wing than she is France or they're gonna viscerally react against Feinstein by voting for the other Democrat\nBut you do for your people naturally listening to the show they say California the wave of the future be where what this is is that when there was a so called primary the top two vote getters go into the general election matter what so if the Democrats are strategizing and take over your steak when November comes you have a choice between bad to worse\nNow that's what it is that's what I said it's ... it's not only mine the other people to suggest that it's I think we should vote for her opponent and maybe she won't win\nRight if you want to be Catholic school do you say okay if she gets re elected as you did or eighties she's getting less less energy I just watched the way she walks to the podium to talk to Senator Grassley their\nGroups Elvis dot super high energy there and if you get Kennedy wrote he's a younger person he will be around for years so he won't have seniority that she'll have but he'll be a threat to us for a while I posted this on Facebook people are upset with me and they did say what\nWas ... that for dying find since she was like more or less the kind of a semi acceptable Democrat because she wasn't as crazy as as as her colleagues\nBut now she joined that that that group and now we're back to the Salem witch trials in Salem witch trials relationship disabled broad right I was gonna say yeah exactly but this was an Salem, Massachusetts a sixty Ninety two they can you know there were ... ... there's a hysterical people that were making crazy accusations against a a number of women there were hung\nA and they were accused of being which is and it wasn't even against what they did but it was it was their ghost that did ...\nFull disclosure is I knew Shaun steel when he was in high school ... you\nKnow let let that go I don't want to hear any more about that I Will do want to ask you though what she credible some listener picked on me saying all your talk shows are saying she has some measure credibility ... she was extremely well prepared she's a psychologist she's done this whole like she's been practicing this role for for many years to come she had a group of very smart media savvy lawyers\nAnd the no she wasn't I thought she gave a good story\nAnd that was effective it was a great presentation but when you dig into it and you see that nothing about her story her life story makes any sense at all but\nYou say that and I agree with you but are Republicans they didn't say she was incredible one of your callers I think the key point we always start out by giving her credibility there\nWell you know because we want to be courteous ... pairing not to be angry against women and and the ... and possibly somebody who was actually had this experience pitch you got the wrong guy and she probably knows in her mind in her heart of hearts that she got the wrong guy but she's ... she's a tool often but you know it's like\nOur our theory they leak the fact we're going to have a women or a woman\nA question her because we don't want these Republican male he's such a self to your consult right so is that a smart move you know first of all it was a good move that to have these senators not grandstand you ... you know ed Royce when each year the foreign affairs committee they hid it in ...\nAnd ... and I looked and it was awful but it wasn't at he's competing but every house member one have their day in the Sunday or their Fifteen minutes of fame so there was no choreography no strategy no coordination\nSo they were wary of that I get that but why should I have to read the New York times Washington Post is going to be a Republican tactics secondly they never should have done the traditional thing alternating Democrat Republican and giving a process I Know that I thought so assuming that she was confident I mean I'd been crosses damned if you have a minimum you want to keep going so he we have lawyers\nOn our site as their US Senators who are so an app that they agreed to this form it right to say look all your Democrats could go through all your stuff there when you're done we're going to have our first question\nThey should have had you there was a ... again the Republicans were in a bind there they're looking at all the stats and the polls and women are angry and they've been walking away a as a sizable number of maybe ten twenty percent of women are walking
