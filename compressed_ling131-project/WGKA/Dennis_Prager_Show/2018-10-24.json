I totally prepared to be in second place on this but I I don't know where that might be found at this time and the reason is I don't have a male gender agenda or female agenda I'm not a man fan or a bad number could people fan\nAnd there are just as many could manage good women and just as many ... ... that's just the way it is it's almost perfectly apportioned\nFor every foolish man there is a foolish woman and vice versa for every good man there is a good woman by and large by large in some societies you will find more of one type than the other I think\nBut any in any event good people do grow on trees where they're male or female by topic today\nIs the column that I Britain this week and it is largely about young men and the question of ambition\nOne of the things that renders men mass killing in the eyes of women or at least that was the case for all of history and I am perfectly prepared to acknowledge that perhaps for young women today it is not the case\nI Would love to get your input on that particular issue incidentally but\nBy and large one of the most appealing traits if I may say regiment renders a man sexy it was one of the things to a woman is ambition knocked\nCrazed and viciousness nor ... no ... ambition I Want to get ahead I Want to be successful\nAnd ambition for all of western recorded history\nWas largely I Wish to succeed at work and I wish to provide for a wife and children I Wish to provide for a family fishes white male ambition this is when I was certainly when I was a kid this was\nWhat was assumed it was so so much of a given it wasn't even articulate it because it was just assumed\nWill you grow up and be able to take care of a family that was male ambition\nAnd uh my sense is that that has been a killed for many young men because it has been killed\nIn the society the notion of raising men boys to be men first of all is it believe it or not is almost considered\nArchaic today a be a man that that is so sexist be a man or a data show patriarchal or some other ... unbelievably destructive adjective useful\nThing for a boy to aspire to be a man was a man a man takes care of the family that is the primary thought the only thing that constitutes a man obviously but it is for most males that has been the defining element\n... will I take care in all senses of the word we'll like take care of a family\nSo my assumption today is that this ambition has been shot first of all a lot of men it for my generation to today even more so today\nOh we're taught that hey you don't have to take care of a family in fact you don't even have to have a family there's no real compelling reason for you to get married and if you do\nOf the female will pull her weight as they say she will row her or just as much as you will roll your or you were all a boat with two or\nBeen and so the notion that that I as a male will need to take care of a family is it's\nSo that again patriarchal at archaic\nDo you agree that's my question do you think that the the man of ambition\nI I Wish to get ahead I Wish to succeed uh I Wish to take care of a family that this is an endangered species I obviously acknowledge that they exist they exist even in significant numbers but I'm the question is proportion so if you especially\nIf you are a woman or if you have a daughter who is dating\nOr do you have a sense that this is taking place\nThat what I have described is in fact what is taking place or a this is an alarm that is not worthy of being sounded because it's not a big deal one eighth Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nThese are the numbers to talk to me if you are dating if you have a son you might have a son for example who was not particularly ambitious who was a more than happy to stay at home and uh you know make a living but not not not really aspire to more I had the sense as I told you\nAre as I mentioned I didn't tell you I Am in any in any lanes but it's my column this week is about\nMy wife and my experience is test driving vehicles last week at five different dealers in the Los Angeles area and my sense and they were all wonderful people are there was this news no knocked on them but my sense was that\nThese were not guys who were particularly ambitious particularly passionate about their work and you could say well maybe they're not passionate about selling cars yeah but it doesn't matter you still have to be passionate about your work even if you don't care about the particulars\nBecause the the more that you're passionate about your work the more successful you'll be and the more you will rise in life\nMy father wanted to be a doctor\nHe couldn't afford medical school so became an accountant he became extremely passionate about accounting which is about is far from being a doctor is you can get but he just decided to his great credit I'm going to become passionate about my work ... do well at it\nSo the question on the table is ... young males and ambition now overly ambitious is not good overly anything if it's good to exercise it's not good to be addicted to marathons I mean there there's no end in life to the to the\nFact that any good thing can be over done\nSo I understand you can have too much ambition because then it's not ambition to take care of a family in an ambition to do good it's ambition to be to be super rich or to be super famous or to be super powerful and that's not a that is not admirable that's not what I'm Talking about\nBut the absence of ambition in men is in a mask you leading characteristic\nThey major part of masculinity is indeed ambition I Want to succeed I Want to take care of I Want to take care of and I want to take care of\nThat's a good thing and it and and in the past it has rendered men desirable to a woman\nBut I I Believe that society has played the terrible trick on both young men and women it's told them that they are at the same is told young women that they are sexually the same as men they could enjoy any number of hookups just as much as men can with no emotional price paid\nAnd now what do you think why do you think that the idiocy of rape culture charge at colleges exists why do you think it exists it exist because so many young women have had sex that they later regretted so rather than saying you know why did I get into it they prefer to use the term rape culture\nThat's that's the genesis of the a phony charges of rape culture and it's by the way this proves that it's fully the proof is that parents and their daughters to college\nNow no parent in the world would send the door to door rape culture I mean what are we are we joking that we were we're living in the New York times\n\nAnd they told me the same thing you know you know you know women women will carry half their weight and in any in any deal and not by the way guys you don't have to get married you know what's what's in it for you to voices a fortune anyway there's nothing in it for you know women are available\nAnd so that doesn't breed the type of man that a fair number of women would walk for a mate [noise]\nRight so are we got that she wanted to teachers say okay so\nHe's so I gave her the examples\nOf their own was a female teacher it was a female teacher it was it was a female people to go on go on why did she say\nSo I gave her the right I gave her those examples and she she stopped for\nA minute and she said oh my God we're why she said my husband feels that way when we see certain shows any changes the channel and she took that poster down on\nAnd on and you know\nWhere that is that as an exceptional teacher and part of the reason I Am convinced is it South Carolina and it is not LA New York Chicago et cetera [noise]\nThat's a powerful story I wrote it down and I think you and Michelle San Diego California Dennis Prager Hi\nHi how are you better well thanks so\nThey're my intellectual hero ally great for taking my call though I think that ... that today are really come in\nI think there's nothing more important than raising children I was a woman studies minor and taught in college that men and women are very excited when I got married and had kids and that's at children you know that that's not true and uh I think that it because it\nCould it have a baby someone needs to stay home and take care of the baby on someone else to go make money and then the money maker isn't really motivated to which is harder now to make money than it used to be a and\nThen everything is located now we have two incomes below ... children are being raised by I'm not sure who are boys and girls after school programs and I think everybody lives as\nWell I think that that's to a large extent except when you know obviously quite wealthy homes could afford a\nA few manny's or at least one and you know it can work but for the great majority of people I don't think it has one particularly well I thank you for

Monday\nAnd then I actually go home I I Will have a recording myself with my wife\nSo [laughter] it's\nA you know people ask me a lot totally understandably so you know you're on the road so much by the way it eighty percent of the time my wife is with me which I'm very blessed to have that ability but not right now and not when I go city the city the city to city\nBut when I go for a few days to a city she was almost always with me which is a real bonus but I Am asked do you know you do you like it and it's such an interesting question totally understandable question\nOn the one hand nobody likes\nFlying every single day for much of a ...\nA and packing a suitcase or again and re packing and entering of a hotel room on the other hand I Walk around thinking how lucky I Am I'm\nI I mean it's only sincerely just as I did when we started this in my twenties\nI never lose sight of the fact people want to hear what I have to say how can I dislike travel if the reason that I'm traveling is that people want to hear what I have to say\nThat's why there was no happiness possible if you don't look at the big picture other aspect is there any job on earth aspects of which people don't enjoy though that there is no ... there's no such job but doesn't exist\nYou like playing baseball and you're paid well to play baseball there were no aspects of of being on a I'm a baseball team that you don't enjoy of course there are talking about travel these guys do it for half the year it constantly\nAnd the work out that they have it's not it's not all farm\nBut\nAny baseball player who whose mind is still intact knows how lucky he is\nTo be paid to do what he loves that's the only way to go through life is to have a perspective on on what you're you're doing so too do you enjoy every single aspect of it there's no such thing it doesn't it doesn't exist\nBy the way I just like to note for no other reason than I Would like to know what it is today is October twenty four twenty Eighteen\nAnd my late mother was born on October twenty fourth Nineteen Eighteen no Nineteen Nineteen I'm wrong or my dad was Nineteen Eighteen\nI made a Boo Boo my dad was a hundred would have been a hundred in July my mom would be Ninety nine today\nIf she was one year younger eerie stuff\nYou know when you think about like the roaring twenties you think of the Nineteen twenties but we're gonna be entering very soon we're entering the twenties again\nTo what are they going to how are they going to distinguish between the twenties and the twenties I don't know maybe they won't be roaring and that's when we'll know the roaring twenties were the Nineteen twenties and the non roaring twenties or the twenty twenties who knows\n[laughter] anyway mom wherever you are and they believe you are somewhere happy birthday from me from your baby\nAll right everybody how to make America America again elect Democrats win back the house or the ... the emotional basis of left wing ... is\nSomething I've been pointing out my whole life St Thomas Friedman is a perfect example of it like to read the program\nAnd he is considered Milwaukee ... liberals he's not even doesn't call himself a leftist but he hates the president and Mrs they hate the president to president represents everything they load the people who vote for them or lower some were deplorable we are the opposite of the Tom Friedman we are I mean it's just\nThe fact we lived differently uh we uh many of us are religious many of us are\nLike guns remembered that cling to religion and guns\nOr many of us are to actually get the chills at the star Spangled Banner many of us think of his early contemptible to ah purposely meal in front of a hundreds of thousands of people rather than staying for the national anthem\nMany of us think that the United states is the greatest force for good many of us think that it's the least racist country in the history of the world many of us think we are blessed to be American so where we were different than the guys are in the Tom treatments world\nBut I like to I'd like to read to you because he is one of the more eloquent spokesmen he knows how to use the language so\nI I I don't I don't want to use a\nA bad example but the best example that the left has so Thomas Friedman in today's New York times okay it's titled how to make America America again elect Democrats\nNow the very notion that you're going to make America American by electing a left wing party is is in itself an absurdity\nThe west wing all over the world which is to undo the American revolution and to preserve the French Revolution every to get a couple of South Dakota for a moment to\nShow the America will be made America Again by having by having Democrats in power to have a more of a a far more socialized economy as an example really All right so let's take some of the things he says some of the things he doesn't talk about\nThe begins one is still left to say about the terrible murder or moderates Saudi journalist ... and its aftermath by the way I don't know if he was moderate or not and I don't know if it's relevant if if the guy was moderator not moderate\nOr what was done to him is disgusting we all agree on that one of the few things left and right can agree with only one thing and I said it before but I feel it even more strongly now in the mid term elections vote for a Democrat campus for a Democrat raise money for a Democrat drive someone else to voting station to vote for a\nDemocrat why does this have to do a well we'll we'll find out what this has to do with ... then he writes I don't say that because I'm particularly liberal oh really\nYou're not particularly liberal that's fascinating said why would you you're not even particularly liberal you you're not let alone left is you're not even particularly liberal Tom Friedman but you want people to vote for a Democrat campus for a Democrat\nUse money for a Democrat drive someone else to voting station to vote for Democrats so you want the left wing party to win but you're not particularly liberal\nOkay I just want you all to follow the logic here and wants to shift the whole country the liberal agenda I say that because I'm particularly American and I want to put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy in politics really the best of American values\nAnd and uh was was that was that for example on display or when the when the rock Obama pulled out of Iraq\nWas that the best of American values and international policy was the shipping of billions of dollars to the Iranian regime\nWhich is worse W. O. R. S. E. then the Saudi regime\nIn terms of doing evil on the face of the earth evil means hurting people in case it meets a definition this is not a religious terms specifically and it's not a complex term evil is the greater amount of hurt that is done to innocent people\nIs greater amount of hurt them to innocent people by Iran or Saudi Arabia the enemy of\nSaudi of the enemy of Iran is\nMr Friedman so if you really care about humanity why wouldn't you while we all recognize how primitive the Saudi regime is and\nAnd it's institutions nevertheless I don't have a choice between a wonderful place and he ... I have a choice between Saudi Arabia and Iran just as\nIn World War two we had a choice between Stalin and Hitler and weak correctly Joe Stalin who even killed more people okay that's that's why I don't know what you mean by put the best of American values back at the center of our diplomacy in politics\nI bring this stuff all the time the deterioration of the New York times in our time but he's never attacked his own newspaper ...\n\nDemocrats could blow it if they get to listen to this and it's it's ... Democrats could blow it if they get back a lever of power and use it just to bully trumping Republicans oh God Democrats bullying people you've got to be ... does he ever word here about cap and all\n\nHe really takes on the tough issues Tom Friedman hey anything word there about the universities and you're\nOh are you proud about what the Democrats to Brett Kavanaugh Thomas Friedman do no I just don't know 'cause there's nothing there\n\nJust to bully trumping Republicans the same way he has them oh\nYou poor bully people but I'll take that chance because there was a basic respect for truth science and decency in the Democratic caucus you gotta be kidding\n\nTo people who deny that there was male and female in the human being they have a respect for science\nYou're You're Joking correct truth truth\nUniversities are committed to truth to left ones the university's Tom Friedman is there a commitment the truth their\nDecency who who who weeks decency after what the democratic caucus did to breath capital decency you have that you had the temerity Tom Friedman to speak about the Democratic party and\nDecency the left and decency\nAfter after the the ... Republican after Republican who was gotten punched while campaigning gotten shop while campaigning for males leaves and and the others were shot at\nA well playing baseball sorry not campaigning and what a bad on all of the ... all of the Republicans who have dinner and people scream obscenities in their face and you talk to me about who's more decent God they live in a very very wonderful\nA power away from reality\nUh what else is he saying I Know the two more years of the GOP holding every lever of power in blindly following Trump's basic disrespect for true science a decency there we go again\nSee it it's so fascinating they they they throw out these gigantic charges I it's all generalized and I generally support I give you specific I just gave you a specific for every example\nWho ... who was been more indecent Republicans or Democrats in the last two years\nTruth without power today is just background ... background ... moved back to the march of the Trump Administration you see I can write that it's vitally important for global stability in the protection of journalists everywhere that those who executed and ordered the murder of cars show you'd be punished\nReally it's vitally important for global stability\nI think they have to be punished I couldn't agree more on moral grounds for global stability when was the what did he write about the need need to punish of the Iranian regime for what it does to journalists\nI was just reading a report about the rape centers in ah in in Iran for women caught up ... regime\nI missed that article I guess in the\nIn the celebration of the Iran agreement that rock Obama me back to the moment the dentist tiger show [noise]\nFactor pain free studio\nAnd nine twenty the answer\n[noise]\nFor that\nSort of news I bought I knew in Washington but U.S officials says a\nFunctional exposed advice was intercepted at a soda near the suburb of New York city home of Hillary and Bill Clinton efficient says ... believe that devices linked to one found on Monday at the\nCompound of liberal billionaires George Soros the official was authorized Republican discussed the ongoing investigation similar devices found also being sent a former President Obama and CNN's New York city headquarters\nOnce mighty hurricane will as we can now into a Trump go to pressure that's moving rapidly over west central Mexico forecasters say\nStorm could still bring two to four inches of rain the areas along its path in northern Mexico that could lead to more ... lives on mountainous terrain prime minister Theresa May says Britain will ban suspects in the killing of Saudi journalist him off the show veep from entering\nBritain she made that announcement today on Wall street the Dow is down one hundred Seventy this was asked to do\nTwenty the answer\n[noise] good when faith you rent new line here here continued to avoid briefing that the biggest ... companies gave me not driving by both directions doing ... and I have a five\nMonth as being at they play down on wind or new line going that direction I think we have gained blending here at my email rather than a ... who became the and the thing ... whomever happening you know by ... while the parents who are scrambling for that for every\nBattle in ... park nine you mean you're here we ran into traffic command center I bring me climb yeah\nThere's one gun store in the area that truly serves their customers to store mainstream guns in range in little burn they serve their customer with great events like this block day that's right listen up block owners mainstream guns and ranges hosting glock day this Saturday October twenty seven\nBy to me block representatives and Winfrey block goody to end of the fund the first one hundred blood firearms purchases on Saturday ... free block range bag you one more okay spend the prize we'll with every fire on bridges to win even more free block prizes it's gotta be crazy bug\nMade a Saturday walk very this Saturday dog day this Saturday at\nMainstream gun that Rangel over remember for Saturday the first one hundred blood firearms purchases get a free La Grange back the use this Saturday for the last day open from ten AM to ten pm only had main street guns in range and Wilbur had Lawrenceville highway and Kilian hill road\nThis story is called the ugly truth about Tom share everything you've done your family's fiber about buying a timeshare you name my\nHelp hello I'm ...
