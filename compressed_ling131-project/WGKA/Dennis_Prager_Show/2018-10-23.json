the truth is that it happened in ... under President Obama and the economy was was not good\nYou are right that there is it that they know how good things are in the United states and how low the unemployment rate is so that they could most likely get a job\nBut uh it's remember ... look let's be honest compared to Honduras Guatemala the American economy is always robust\nSo these people aren't sitting down with the wall Street Journal and checking out the stock prices that they they know where it's better here is the point though that the\nKey point is that is just should be made every single day why would these people want to replicate the failed societies from which they come\nBy the way I Know again for the left who in their superficial little intellectual bubble think to say something is a failed societies to engage in racism has nothing to do with race that is one hundred percent values zero percent race\n\nCan't people ask why is America prosperous is is that if you were in Guatemala\nYou every one of you listening if you weren't granted Guatemala and and seeded orange hunter is renowned Salvador and watching or in Brazil doesn't matter any Latin American country essentially and watching your society\nThat's being mired in poverty and corruption why wouldn't you ask the single most obvious question why is America affluent\nThere was no other question anyone in Latin America thinking about the economic situation there were other situations but thinking about economics there is no other question to be asked\nWhy does America work why don't Americans asked that question why does America work but they don't\nInstead the left asked asks why is America so racist Gina phobic and homophobic and Islamophobia could cetera\nWhat you what people who care about people as opposed to get just care about anger should be asking is why does it work\nThe question in this question intelligent people thoughtful people ask if not why even American chap slaves it's wide at America abolish slavery\nIt's not why use their poverty in America it's why use there so much affluence and America every question asked is the wrong question\nThat that's the point that needs to be made something just that just came to my mind I was just reading about the likelihood of Americans of different Americans when I was speaking about Americans complaining on the left\nThere was

people will say what you mean that's the point it's not valued\nLet me tell you ... where this is it my whole life is been a ... a love I Want to understand what is wisdom understanding of life that is what wisdom is okay it's a it's if the single word term for understanding of life\nYou can know a great deal and understand nothing that is why the highly educated are usually the least wise that Bruce of our society\nHey because universities teach the opposite of wisdom they teach you to be a fool in my opinion some people escape on harmed but many build a secondly because they teach you implicitly if not explicitly\nThat knowledge is what matters rather than wisdom\n[noise]\nWalk to what aside from political correctness and the preoccupation and race and gender what does it show that

oriented build the word food is used pretty often\nWhat was the food the food was a person without wisdom doesn't mean a person without compassion so let me talk to you about compassion for a moment wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion and setting social policy\n\nWith me if it's if if you just hear that today it will be very important if only that sinks in in making political social policy for a society wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd that's what we have that is what we have in the western world\nVast amount of compassion or pseudo compassion it doesn't matter even if it's genuine compassion\nBut compassion without wisdom is overly destructive so I feel bad for people I'm not going to get into policies are going to continue the discussion about wisdom book I give you an example here I feel\nBad for people who don't have as much as others and so we will give them more\nBenefits but the ... person asks what are you doing to that person and to the society by giving them more and more people benefits\nIs it good for society is a different question that's a question of wisdom is compassionate is not a question that has anything to do with wisdom\n\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd we don't produce people with wisdom because wisdom is in talks wisdom isn't
