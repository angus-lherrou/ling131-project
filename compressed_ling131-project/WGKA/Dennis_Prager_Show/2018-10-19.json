I'm not an anti Semite on them I'm an anti termite\n\nBut you know all of your kids all ALL every one of your kids was go to a regular University in Hillsdale or a non Christian\nHas a or a few others ... has learned every so Ninety nine percent of your kids and grandchildren have learned the college that a black cannot be a racist so how could you possibly accuse\nFarrakhan who believes that whites were created by a mad scientist and that the Jews are termites among other things you said about Jews or ... how could he he's not he can't be a racist or an anti Semite because he's black\n\nPeople in good conscience stay on the left eye it's they they have to be aware of what the left does\n\nI don't I it's it's it's truly a an amazing thing to me that there are people listening who think that there are good people and that they're ... not pro liberal pro left\nIs it is [noise] hello\nEverybody I'm Dennis Prager and this is broadcast every week because life is a challenge for the vast majority of people I Would say there's a tiny sliver of people for whom life has been pretty much a walk\nIn the park I knew\nTo such people\nAnd then it uh the last years were not off at the park was very it's a it's unbelievably rare unbelievably rare\nItself for uh people it's varying degrees of challenge ... that's that's the way it is that's the reason I ever happiness hours reason I wrote a book on happiness is a reason I lecture on it\n'cause if you can bring people to understand certain things than you can increase their happiness and if nothing else at least to have their tax happier because that's a moral obligation not to inflict bad moods upon other people [noise]\nSo today's subject is a is a life change or if you take it seriously\nWe determine how others see us\n\nYeah if you get that people think that some objective reality determines how they are seen by others but the truth is your behavior determines how you are seen by others\n[noise]\nAnd I'll give you an example you you may recall the\nThe show with a remarkable woman Gail McWilliams who is blind and\nWho if you meet her\nYou don't think about her blindness you just think about jail\nScale is charming and Gail is full of life\nAnd death in other words she's not when you when you deal with her you're not thinking the whole time she's blind you're thinking the whole time she scale\nThere are blind people with whom you would think the whole time that well I'm I'm dealing with a blind person\nFear or people who have I'm giving you some pretty dramatic ones and the issue here is not blame or anything like that it is just to tell you the truth about how you are perceived\nAnd I'm going to give you other examples all of them are sensitive but everyone was sensitive example [noise] another one is ... parents who lose a child\n\nThat can become and I'm not blaming or anything else but I'm just describing the reality that can become their identity there so and so she lost her son she lost her daughter he lost the daughter she lost to some\nOr that is part of their by auto biography but it is not the defining element in how they are perceived because that's not what they radiate\nWhen they meet you what\nEver it is you or the one who determines how others see you\n\nBut it's also true we'll give you another example for minorities whatever the minority might be racial\nOr sexual or\nA religious\nYou determined\nBy and large certainly in the United states the United states you determine how you are perceived if you are a racial minority and you are or your self perception is as a primarily a victim of racism you will be regarded\nAs overwhelmingly a member of that group\nRather than as job or Susan just take two common American names but probably not that common now frankly\nWant to look up the most common names I should learn what they are and use them now what's the most common birth name of the last minute for girls and boys\nThis is this is a big big deal you you are a you are in a religious minority\nYou you are the one who sets the agenda on the house majority will regard you know people and minorities don't think that way they think that that's how they're perceived the whole time I suspect that there\nAre are we have we have the names there the link or the link to need to link on me that was the main but it's okay it's okay you did you do the\nMan on the line now I Know that are here we are baby ... dot com and the answer is for\n... minutes okay here we go for I cannot believe if Liam Liam is the number one baby named for boys this past year\n... you don't believe it or why would they make it up\n[laughter] who has the lead magenta [laughter]\nPeople break up the says they ever to ... ...\n... it's very not number two I Do believe no\nOne\nWhen I'm In it now the female number one is Emma I Believe that number two is Olivia very very nice and what is there we go number forty is savannah how many savannah is you know\nAnyway All right so that's what I'll do now from our I'm OK Liam or ever right go find a way of John even on the list no Jack is yeah I Know but I don't but I Know there's no job it's amazingly Susan and I'm a list\nThat's\nGot to go to Nineteen sixty because Susan\n... feel terrific [laughter]\nBen is on the other hand you have to go to the nineteenth century\n[laughter] you\nKnow it's not there are no young one All right anyway you on the one who sets it you know I I have been since I was in my twenties\nI have often been in places where I was the only Jew I realized very early on it is up to me to make everybody relaxed 'cause they ... it was a great it was a great revelation to me\nThat the the obligation ironically 'cause I I I Believe Americans have goodwill and couldn't care less your religious ethnic racial background doesn't matter you want if you're gay you set the agenda whether do they see you as Liam of\nThat ad or\nAs a gay guy you said that agenda\nDo they see you as primarily black or Hispanic\nOr in my case as a Jew or do they see you as Dennis\nBut doesn't deny that you're a Jew doesn't deny if you're a black and doesn't deny if you were gay doesn't deny you if you want every minority group you're rebut doesn't deny it but you don't wear it any more than you where I Am blind or you where I have lost the child\nIs almost impossible for me to overstate the importance of this subject because we have it all back which we think that it's the task of the majority to make the minority person or the person who's different\nFeel great yes to a certain extent but without their cooperation if they wish to wear their identity\nThat makes them different\nThan they have chosen one aide Prager seven seven six is is big stuff eight seven seven to for three triple seven six we now have a sponsor for the uh for the happiness out on\nYou don't know how many times I've been asked to them as a sponsor for this great show [noise]\n\nAll right I think that

I'll pull him aside afterwards and say when mine them that you have a brand and\nWhen did you advertise about your brand today\nAnd one is that brand what do you mean by you have a brand\nThat you know your your your name your reputation the image that people have a view that's your brand and\nOh that's good okay All right I see what you're saying your brand is what makes you different it's what makes you you\nYeah your advertising who you are that's right and things yeah work with kids better so I you know your advocacy what did you advertise about yourself today as he is a good person that is because my wife she minutes late are holding this big guy ... flew the\nThat's why you have a famous Susan of Minneapolis [laughter] if this could\nFor [laughter]\nThank you that's a good one that is exactly right\nIt was it was one of the great liberating sings of my ... my twenties when I realize that\nAnd I remember even where I realized that I'm very open about my life to to folks it's it's a certain vulnerability sort of gives you a lot of strains credibility and because then if you're opaque people don't trust you\nAnd rightfully so [noise] so anyway I remember when this happened

school so I felt a little different\nBut what people describe me they never started describing there oh ... okay I hear that at the beginning but it quickly changed when I felt\nWell part of the reason and and this is very important until ... if I'm wrong in your case tell me but I think part of the reason is what you mentioned very at the very beginning they weren't that many Mexicans in Michigan so you see so if that was an advantage to you\nBecause when you're an immigrant community and you can stay with that community in this in self imposed ghetto then you are primarily back and not Bob\nI I agree with that because and and other cities in Michigan where I grew up there were REO so to speak but in the city I grew up there wasn't one show we are intermingled with everyone and
