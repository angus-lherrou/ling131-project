center for science and culture at the discovery Institute in Seattle or\nI Would you tell people I think it's important given that we are going to talk about science and face so tell people don't be humble of some of your credentials in the you're in that arena\nSure um I as you mentioned direct is a network of scientist or run out of the discovery Institute in Seattle uh uh my PHD's in the philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge in England prior to that I worked as a geophysicist and uh\nThe double a physics geology or science degree and as an undergraduate and I'm\nA Britain a couple a couple of books um one signature in the cell and the question of the origin of the first life in the second one called Darwin's doubt\nA which is a question about the origin of the first animals which uh prepare very abruptly in the fossil record in Contra diction to Darwin's own expectations of a very gradual origin for for animal life so your life has been immersed in science\nBy the way just I've never asked you this and all our time both privately and a um a radio when public what does the philosophy of science\nMe it's the it's the discipline that addresses scientific questions that are right at the margin of science and philosophy things about\nThe nature and uh [noise] basis of human knowledge the what's called in philosophy pissed apology how we know what we know but also questions about a new consciousness the origin of the university origin of life\nUm and needed is that the topics that have always really fascinated me how did we get here how did life get here\nUm there's a huge scientific dimension to these questions but they also have encouraged to believe philosophical implications and so\nI've always been attracted right at that boundary between the two and you have\nTo learn a lot of science to be any good in it and you have to be thinking philosophically to make any sense of a great combination did you enjoy your time ... really if you have to do if you have to do something is grueling as a PHD it's nice to do it in some place like Cambridge or Oxford with a lot of cultural compensations and wonderful people and the weather\nHelps the weather's awful but I brought in Seattle so I was\nAll yeah already knocked elated at night I never thought about\nHis latest book which he edited is a collection of essays and don't let the title of it in any way that you see is the evolution a scientific philosophical up the logical critique Miller worth the ... revolution is\nThe attempt of many and a very good will people\nTo reconcile God and evolution and this is a series of essays critic critique critical of that position right up that position so let me get to that the book is up a dentist Prager dot com and obviously I mean if you interested in theology or science will find this immensely interesting\nSo I mentioned she right before we went on the air that\nI until really I met you to be honest\nUh my my view was I didn't really care about evolution if it didn't bother me if it was true and it didn't bother me if it wasn't true I Believe in God as the creator of the heavens in the earth the God of genesis one\nAnd if if God used evolution water why care it's all a miracle anyway so that in a in a nutshell Ben I I read you and talk to you\nAnd my wife frankly who's loews or a fair amount of as you know about evolution and and uh it has become less and less tenable not for religious reasons but for scientific reasons\nTo\nUh to endorse the evolution as it is generally taught so before we get to a garden evolution\nI Know this is ridiculous in the time that I'm getting a gift you put in a couple of minutes can summarize\nEvolution and why it's not always paid be skeptical about well not not only we pay a but but scientists right this is what you would have been my mind to scientists are having trouble with ... right right okay go ahead so quick\nDefinitions of the term evolution for orientation first is simply change over time nobody nobody challenges that there has been changed over time or the kind of small scale variation we see in Galapagos finch beaks are peppered mobs or um bacteria that acquire ... antibiotic resistance is sometimes called micro evolution\nUm second definition of evolution is the idea of universal common descent and the idea that all organisms are connected by common ancestry back to one or very few simple forms such that the best picture of the history of life is like a giant branching tree as part of Darwin's argument the origin\nAnd the third in most controversial meaning of evolution is the idea that there's an ... guided directed mechanism namely natural selection acting on random mutations\nThat can produce all the new forms of life that of emerged in the history of life that produces all the change over time\nAnd that that mechanism um it is also responsible for the appearance of design that that ... biological systems manifested even leading evolutionary biologist acknowledge\nSo those are three key definitions the first is innocuous nobody doubts that the second is somewhat controversial the third is where do you stay with my second on the tree I'm I'm skeptical about the universal common descent there's a lot of continuity in the fossil record and then the genomic a patterns that we are now observing\nA but the key issue and the one that leading evolutionary biologist themselves are now questioning is the idea that the mutation selection mechanism as genuine creative power the ability to generate fundamentally new forms of life uh so what you hear a lot of evolutionary biologist quoting now an aphorism is that\nA mutation selection explains the survival but not the arrival of the fittest explains a small scale variations but nothing major innovations in virtue about uh two years ago this time um I was at a conference at the of the royal society in Britain the oldest\nIn arguably most August scientific body in the world they called a conference to a assess modern neo Darwinism and specifically to call for\nA new theory of evolution many of the evolutionary biologist there were deeply unhappy with the idea that mutation and selection as creative power the opening talk of the conference by ... leading Austrian evolutionary biologist and numerous rated uh several key when he called explanatory deficits of the modern version of Darwin's theory ...\nIsn't that a number of the the the deficits that he enumerated were things that I had written on at length in my own book Darwin's doubt\nThis bombing the the Royal Society what is the ...\nThe royal society of London it was started by you know Robert Boyle Newton was one of its first president was yeah yeah\nJust reading about them yesterday okay so they ... that's incredible that you had a conference on the weaknesses of the traditional Darwinian explanation where\nWhere most if not all of the talks where we're exploring some new mechanisms that could supplement compliment replace the\nStandard mutation selection mechanism the odd thing about the conference however was that uh there were a group of of what they called themselves third way people they don't want to associate with those of us who are um supportive of intelligent design and that is a growing number of scientists by the way\nA ... but they reject standard near Darwinism so they're looking for another approach they have their ... of of one group of scientists has known as the uh Alton Berg sixteen and one of the scientists who was involved in that we have called the conference declared at the end of this Royal Society conference\nThat it was interesting but it was characterized by a lack of momentous in other words they did a good job of critiquing the neo Darwinian mechanism but nothing really was offered to solve this\nProblem because they've injected rejected out out of hand intelligent any sign\nAnd guidance any any any like minded purpose in in in the process by our eye for rises\nSo where those flaws might be and then the issue of reconciling if possible God and this and evolution my guest Dr Steven Meyer director of the center for science and culture the discovery Institute in Seattle now edited the is the evolution\nA an Asian of destruction or it can it introduced very minor preserve a bull changes that might slightly weaker optimize\nNoisy and when I hear you say this I'm thinking of all the ... pre eminent scientists of the last hundred years who have believed what you say is not tenable\nWhat does that say if you are right what does that say about scientists\nThat science like uh every other form of human endeavor can be subject to groupthink or to ... uh or it can be influenced by prior ideological commitments in particular\nIn the debate about biological origins there is a prior commitment to a materialistic approach to the question it's codified in a principle donors methodological natural awesome and it says it if you're going to be a true scientists\nYou have to limit yourself to strictly materialistic explanations for everything not just how nature ordinarily operates\nWhich would be quite sensible but where in nature itself came from\nAnd that principle Ben precludes the possibility of a ... a precludes consideration of designing intelligence and yet what did we discovered at the foundation of life we've discovered digital code\nA Bill Gates the our local hero in a in in the Seattle area says the DNA is like a software program will be much more complex than we've ever device but where does software come from\nIt comes from a mind we have all sorts of indications of intelligence um activity at the foundation of life we've got digital code we have a a complex information processing system we have nano technology miniature machines that um\nAre a mind blowing in their integrated complexity we've got circuitry controlling the expression of genetic information and know persuasive Darwinian explanation has been offered for any of this type of complexity the integrated or organizational complexity at\nThe most likely all some aberration was born and prosper because it was better than the previous it\nA ... a a a plausible theory in the nineteenth century was formulated by Darwin before we knew about the complexity of life at the microscopic and molecular level\nUh in the wake of that theory of a a principle of reasoning was codified among scientists namely that we must limit ourselves to materialistic ... explanations of the kind that Darwin a promulgated and then there's the evidence from the Nineteen fifties sixties and write to the president has begun to stack up\nEvidence that would in any other realm of experience point to a designing intelligence that the principal of methodological naturalism has prevented many scientists from considering the obvious right Haitian\nOkay I'm totally on board the ... the question that you
