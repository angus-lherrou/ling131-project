would be against him the idea that the west supplanted indigenous cultures in the western world is to them despicable\n... ask leftists would've been better if the Europeans never came to North

where we're going out about the map of where we are\nAlthough that but to wake us today is going to be a little more political than most are not in the sense of direct politics but the subject has political correct political ramifications I have a\nHave a sad realization that I'd like to share with you\nFor better\nMaybe I shouldn't put in his head realization I have a question to pose\nAnd by my earlier statement that said realization you'll have an idea of what I think the answer is but here's my question to people prefer liberty or to be taken care of\n\nSo you know my you know my answer even if you have never heard me before just by the fact that I said said realization you know what I I Believe I've come to the conclusion that most people prefer to be taken care of and lose liberty\nThan have liberty\nAnd not be taken care of and have to take care of themselves now obviously out to the extreme that you can find a doctor you can't find the hospital you can find a policeman obviously there is we're talking about within certain bounds\nBut\nThat is how that is how people think I Want to be taken care of and if I lose liberty and the process that's OK America was founded on the belief of liberty\nAnd I think most Americans assume for a while I don't know I take that back I think a lot of Americans assume that\nThat was in a chord with the human the\nUniversal human desire freedom\nBut it it it is it do you know the New York times are you ready I'm telling you this is going to shock you\nShock you in terms of its stupidity as much as in terms of its politics the New York times had an op ed piece in the last few days I did not mention it but I read it\nAnd I have to clean it up or I mean there wasn't it wasn't that all profane but you know kids listen to this and I ... that\nThat but also put it in a very ... general way and somewhat opaque adults will understand it\nWas an article about women who have lived under communism and then lived under freedom so his East German women\nAnd then the wall was torn down and they mail had freedom no longer living under communism the article was a serious article you must understand this is not a lampooned is not from the onion it was a serious article claiming\nThat women under communist Germany living in communist East Germany\nHad a more fulfilling sex life than women in a West Germany\n\nYou read that correct now the argument was they were so taken care of that the absence of the freedom to even speak did not trouble them as much as they felt rewarded by all the benefits of a communist state\nThis by the way series of articles in the New York times about how life in less free societies can be better\n\nTo then there was another article just the let's see what today Wall Street journal what's we give up for free money\nI moved to Sweden for love or money\nBut I was happy to learn that merely living in this social democracy also entitled me the paid parental leave benefits who could object to free money handed out by the government to all Swedish parents then I became a father\nAnd he talks about the you know everything's free health care subsidized housing paid leave out employment benefits job training pensions\nAnd you know he said this system of inter laced welfare programs is the government's attempt to realize the political and social ideal that has seemingly universal acceptance among sweep fitness noticed they get here why doubled G.
