yes go on and on\nAll my friends that have spring or have a male or female our every Wednesday the second hour of my show\nKnown as the dentist Prager show [noise]\nFeatures the male female our I think it's most honest talked about men and women in the media I may be wrong and by the way if I'm wrong I Will acknowledge it [noise]\nI Want us to talk I don't mean to be the winner of the honest talk sweepstakes but I think it is at this point\nAnd as I always point out few my agenda is to understand men and women better to have them get along better I met a man fan and I am about a woman fan I'm a good person fat okay got that out of the way it's been such an intensity and a male female issues in\nThe news so I decided to choose a seemingly lighter subjects I say seemingly because I think it goes to some interesting distinctions between men and women or an interesting distinction\nAbove it is not of the heavy duty variety of an issue that is often on the table in our show and in American Life but I think it's it's fascinating and I think you will enjoy it when I Want to hear your take it's very simple subject\nI have no I Know what came to me yesterday and I don't remember what engendered it\nSo here is very simple would you prefer a gift or a gift card as a gift is it\nMy theory is more men prefer a gift cards and more women prefer gifts and I have a theory as to why I have that theory\nSo [laughter] this is a\nTheory about a theory my theory is women if they receive a gift they see wow look at the thought that was put into\nThis uh getting me this gift that is really moving and beautiful for beautiful and therefore moving men think\nHey what a great deal I now have a hundred dollars to spend at X Y or Z that I didn't have before I could buy exactly what I Want for me thank you\nAm I speaking for you is the producer\nBut now interesting to me because I Believe that every one if every one of the three males affiliated with the direct presentation of the show triple gee the living martyr and I have feminine sucked I Do I Believe that\nAnd sure enough tripled jeeze feminine\nSide came out where he said he would like to get a gift not a gift card after I laughed at him for about five minutes we resume the conversation\n[laughter] [laughter]\nDid\nThey have gift cards when I was growing up not only that they had cars that yes running water showers bats yes no no no no it's amazing even even automatic transmissions said\nThat at the amazing I Know I Know I Can't believe that question did they have gift cards really there's that whole his that hilarious that gift cards no no they was invented when you were born oh my God\nThis this generation we keep him around is like a sort of a a you know to stay in touch with what the with what the the new folk\nThink anyway one aide Prager seven seven six eight seven seven to for three triple seven six and that is that that's the theory\nThat I'm I'm working women love too by the way there's no better or worse here this is a at all there there is no such thing in this regard I'm simply offering you may be wrong by the way I I maybe I I think I'm right\nWell obviously or I wouldn't have said it but you know buddy what is your take see and I I Know in this case by the way you may be curious I think I should add that show what is your Dennis prayers feminine side\nAnd I said it to these guys and the the the living martyr didn't fully believe me I don't know why\nI have no agenda here I have I Know why he doesn't really believe I have a feminine side this has been a ... [laughter] no no no no no he doesn't believe I have a feminine side yes\nAnd he's wrong and I give you an example I prefer in movies I prefer romantic comedies\nTo slash him shoot them uh dramas where you know action to action dramas men law yes Ben love high speed car chases\nThe guy shot him and this and and as it does do nothing exploded shit that's explosion [laughter] ... rice explosions [laughter] that was great I\nI I turned to the popcorn vendor when the when there's an explosion it it it does nothing for me but a romantic comedy I Am totally enthralled I Love it I I Believe it I moved into the whole situation I mean I Love sleepless in Seattle I I was riveted\nYes I Know that I'll guys yes I you don't even have to turn it off that's right triple ... so the living martyr is in the middle you liked both correct that was your statement you like a romantic comedies and and uh explosions okay fine\nBy the way I did like I Love James Bond movies that I admit but that was when I was when he smoked cigars and and the love women\nI have to wait and the ... the early days and and that's right and gift cards that is correct you see Dr know you see that the number of it as a gift card slip through them that is exactly right yeah yeah and exploded the gift card did explode\n[laughter] so everybody was happy that the guys were happy and you know what if [laughter]\nSo I Am this this is a male female addition is devoted to tennis is theory on gift card versus gift I didn't ask my wife I ... I mean I I you know as well as I Know her\nI could see what do you think you know my wife very well what do you think sue would would would answer\nThe tough one what would your wife answer I suspect the gift yeah okay I I Do [noise] I Know there is a good argument in both I think if she likes the gift I think she'd be very touched\nBut I Would be touched too if I like the gift but the chances of your getting me something that would that I Would enjoy as much as me getting need that\n... are are very small ... who knows better what I Want then I that's my that's my rational bail brain talking\nSo let's say if if there's a hundred dollar gift right since the generous gift a hundred dollar gift that somebody's spends they have fought to it\nAnd and I know that gave thought to it but it's not what I Would choose for me of course I'd rather have a hundred dollar gift certificate but people think this is another thing people think that you're getting them a gift certificate chose you didn't think you took the easy way out\nBut I I I don't relate to that at all\n[noise] listen don't couples set up what do they call when they set up an account at a at a department store or a furniture store\nMaybe ... you know what I mean you know ... people no no come on guys you guys are so out of it you don't you couples marrying set up a thing what is it cold [laughter] this is a problem when you work with men\nUh\nAny way they set up an account and you ... you ... that way they could get the the the dishes they want they could get their register that thank you that's right they register with the store\nNow All right you're right I should've known knowing romantic comedies but the last time there was a registry even romantic comedy was Eighteen sixty nine the first I'm a picture of protected [noise]\nSo ... now that's an example though right that's like a gift card ... ... are couples are touched by that if you give in to their registry [noise]\nAll right this is my
