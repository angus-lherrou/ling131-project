monies you on the radio I Am Troy harming here today with your McKinsey and the jury Barker and gosh\nWhat's going on ... is a ringing in the background so you ought to be going to say this recovering from the week you know it's been quite quite busy yeah I was having says I'm going oh yeah\nWell a little ... little little ... when the market yeah Wednesday market asking the five hundred sold off three percent in a single day which it's been a while since we saw that a little bit yeah yeah ah so ah volatility\nBack um what's called other a lot about anybody's guess but uh yeah I mean here's the thing\nUh economically ... the situation has changed significantly we do have higher interest rates we also have falling inflation ... um\nWe've got a which is much better than the inverse of that no doubt [laughter] we got the fed pretty active in the market they said that they're going to continue raising interest rates in the next one is expected in December\nUm you know so I'm no one wanted we see all these crazy when you've got you combine that with these midterms coming up which creates a lot of uncertainty most times and you know more because he don't certain tune you combine that even with the tariffs and all these other things that\nThere were land has to be seen that right how that's going to impact the overall markets and so\nI I think you know volatility is going to be expected when you've got so much going on at the same time but as we've talked about many times over the week\nThere's not really been a lot of fundamental change that we've seen coming from a either the economic reports which we'll talk a little bit about her son but also you know we're we're starting a new earnings season and from what I've seen most of it's been very healthy or companies' bottom lines or or still\nUh you know looking great uh they're they're not just beating earnings are in fact most of them or or suppressing it quite a bit in terms of the expectation yeah for that so not fundamentally you know I don't I don't see anything of great concern yet but\nUh how some of this plays out because because ultimately\nAbsolutely are so um let's just throws numbers out there three percent after I after Wednesday's kicked down and we're down three percent for the week\nSo it's basically I was the whole move 'em if you look at ... year today we're up about two percent of the S. and P. five hundred information technology still leads the way a a nine point eight three percent but if you look at what's happened\nUh you know I've talked about it several times we get up to where the S. and P. five hundred was twenty six percent made up of information technology stocks anybody want to guess what it is today\nI mean text elite in a way right now I'm a three percent I just said it was maybe Eighteen Twenty one twenty point five so funny you know although it's still shows you that it it is the leader here today it hasn't been\nThe leader lately you know as you go from a twenty six percent white or in technology to make up the overall lessen the five hundred down to twenty percent\nYes what's falling fastest yeah they're the same thing that rose this over the last couple of years so I'm not real surprising but uh looking deeper consumer discretionary up ... percent healthcare up seven and a half\nOr you want to look the other end of the spectrum materials which is really small and aid is getting as Jacob keen our analysts are research analyst would say\nIt's getting monkey hammered whatever that means he never tells me what it means but when he says it that is the same thing you to says Glasgow turnover is getting amongst the hammer notice of fourteen point seven eight percent decline ... year today in materials financials or in a similar boat only half\nAs bad seven point seven percent down\nA industrial almost seven percent lower\nUm you know you look at a look at the top end info tech consuming discretionary healthcare the fourth one is\nUh utilities which is up six point six percent thereabouts so ah some of the some of the things that are that we would normally see lead like consumer staples remember we've talked about that when and how it was in the dumps for a while the odds only down one point nine seven and if you look at um [noise] what it's done\nA really over the past five days a consumer staples actually leads the way to point to eight percent now ... we've been talking about rebalancing a portfolio we've set it in the middle of the summer you know it's probably a good time to pay back your technology by a little bit of consumer staples ...\n... s week shows that perfectly living yeah this is probably still the major point uh you know when we're talking to clients and hey we talked to him a little more these days when you see volatility that's when we are in our keep you know when when the sky is blue and everything's\nA coming up sunshine than a robot he's really going to call in and fret over their their portfolio but hey when you hit a three percent down day\nPhone rings little little bit more goods clients attention for ... so now so I'm\nSure you made a mention of ah of earnings\nAre or were in the middle of earnings season or for the third quarter for two thousand Eighteen\nI'm forty percent of all companies in the U.S and be five hundred had have reported and earnings growth twenty two point seven five percent relative to last year's third quarter and his ... and when you need to just be selling everything you know it's great you probably ...\nYeah that's that's what we're trying to get close comfortable with at the moment she knows that look after all the games that have been head and even for things are still be looking good as you just mentioned sure\nYou got to get comfortable with the rebels process to you know because yeah you might be giving up some growth did you decide you're going to sell a higher high flying stock right on the mood is hoping that you wouldn't expect to be but\nThey also there's the risk right um and you made a bunch of money now you want to protect some of it but still remain invested sort of got growth opportunity and a protection at the same time and and really that that mentality is something that without it can be very difficult to uh to to stay the course and and not end up losing the bunch of money 'cause you remain exposed to all the ...\nYeah but it's still OK to go in three balance now yes the markets calmed down a little bit but from our high right\nIt's still okay just because it's coming down a little bit doesn't mean we stopped and re think ... point yeah so I felt the name of this game was to buy low and so high so if we're not selling at the top are we not selling it All right you know you feel you can still make money like deal or throw it out talking\nAbout earlier you know even though you might still after this kind of corruption that we've seen over the past week if you're planning to rebalance and by the securities back chances are those who suffered a bit as well so you know you might not so as high as you could have but you're also not going to have to buy is I Would have so it's still as long as we're playing it back into a market than should be fine for those of you who\nHurt his back in the middle of summer saying go ahead and rebalance your portfolio in fact I've been talking about I think we've done it several January yeah yeah I've been talking about it since January in fact we had a meeting the last day of January very almost the last day of January\nOr what our student from folks market was up seven point one percent and I told them I Believe the market might get again in two thousand Eighteen between six and eight percent which means at the end of January ousted and told him were up seven point one percent\nSo set up there you go to your neighbor and give him a high five point in the market uh it\nYou know by the lack of volatility ... we had in two thousand Seventeen I knew would not last forever or the other pieces yeah we haven't killed the business cycle either so at some point\nThings are going to get rough but guess what I'm Still not seen that in in economic numbers so I still would say um you know stay invested stay invested to your long term strategy but if you're sectors are out of whack\nClean it up mix outfits are up and all I can say is if you didn't do it in the middle of summer when we were talking and and you thought oh listen to those on the radio or maybe this is a little bit of confirmation now um it is time you know the volatility these great when it's going in your favor\nBut I like I said you know ... cells are fast this is what rules fast you know the one with the biggest appreciation the fastest appreciation when\nTimes get a little bit rocky and that's what you wind up doing so or ... your point about a earnings out facing even what the analysts that expected we said twenty two point seven five percent growth\nAs a four point eight percent surprise so basically for four nights a four point eight percent better than a analysts would have said well we would be doing right now so um yeah it's it's what's what's wrong with that\nI look I think the market does doesn't not like inflation right so that's that's called and I would say the majority of this because they are not inflation but just hiring interest rates I Wish the fed is doing in order to control inflation so just think about like this we'd much rather have some higher interest rates than higher inflation and so it was a let that\nHappen as with me because that's the the lesser of two evils I Would say and it's just necessary at some point the rage cannot remain as low as they've been forever and we do need to start moving the back of slowly and methodically and and the fed is doing that even even though they're continuing to uh\nGet a lot of pushback from the current administration I think it's I think is the proper move because I'd much rather see that in ... higher inflation at this point\nThen that's doing a few things number one is probably causing you to have to invest those dollars in your portfolio a bit more safely so the try out the liquidity 'cause you're you're going to be planning for some liquidity but\nYou know we would always go by ten you're All right I'm In a non any known spending you need within the next ten years should be set aside or at least a accounted for in some way if if it needs to be set aside and your portfolio we would put it in bonds which is right you know going to be lower volatility then\nThis is what if you're more the greatest well we just don't want to have to select would use to get your money we know you're going to need right and the thing with armed cheeses you don't have to take those in cash so while you do have to take the\nThe money out of your retirement account if they're invested in those dollars invested they can simply be be moved to an after tax account and remain invested so long as you've got you know some cash there to make withholding some and you want to make one but the point is and I think how we generally feel there's not always the case across the board but generally speaking\nWe would prefer clients to take their Social Security benefits earlier rather than later and while that might cause a discounted benefit to do what it would also prevent them having to take more from from their portfolio which\nAre in most cases is going to be growing I Would expect that a lot higher rate than what the Social Security benefit tends to grow your years here you take that let your assets in your retirement accounts remain growing or or at least in a security that is going to have more potential for grows rather than say a bond or something that\nUh and and so did the money that you're ... because of what you paid in all your life ... ... your your retirement assets grow and then to the extent that you need more money from your retirement account take that\nBut get the money that you rode a from the Social Security administration first I think because that is money that yours and is going to really allow you to probably make more progress with portfolios so let\nMe play devil's advocate for a minute so Garrett wind the world would I take it now when if I wait I get more money from the government will\nLook how long you live well that's no slips exactly what we're ... yeah [laughter] ... what is your family like it'll be an angel player the first question might not I mean it is kind of a morbid thong right but you know you sit down across the table from somebody and say\nWell we can plan a lot better for you if we know exactly when you're going to die can you tell me and they tell me that I Would tell you the day you should start taking so you had and exactly how much money you're going to spin and or have\nTo spend right of for the rest of your time in fact we usually run a financial plan out to what is it Ninety five years old Ninety ... Ninety two so you know not everybody lives to Ninety to in fact it's a longer life expectancy than than we would see in the east in the interest charge where they force you to take that\nTo our indeed it conservative to\nYes so uh you know we got a\nLook at the bottom line is that those retirement assets and your portfolio will probably still be there and be able to pass onto a been a fishery upon your death\nThe only thing you can do with that Social Security benefit is allow your spouse to get yours is that makes the most sense after you're gone but these things cannot pass through generations Social Security benefits that is correct pass through generations like retirement ss can so the more you can keep it in their retirement accounts\nThe better off you're going to be I think in you know talking multiple generations and down the road but actually my family yeah can you remind you pay that and that is your a tax the ... part tax that comes out of your portfolio your paycheck\nSo and it stops upon death and every single time yeah All right so ah when we come back we'll finish up this topic and the answer some\nFinancial questions that\nThey can stick around money you're right [noise]\nAt Hitler Norton insurance we recognize the importance of both quality and value when it comes to selecting answer\nAs a full service insurance agency we provide various types of policies such as home owners and auto insurance\nAs well as in Berlin policies to ensure that you're not exposed to unexpected gaps in coverage by providing clients with custom policies that meet their personal insurance needs we provide them the tools are required to protect the most significant investments and their lives when you choose Hitler Norton insurance you're choosing a team of committed professionals who will prepare it customized\nRisk management plan tailored to your unique situation to learn more about the many features and types of coverage available to you contact us at seven seven zero four to nine Ninety One sixty six or seven seven zero four to nine Ninety One sixty six\nI'm Dr Jean ... and I want to tell my friends down in the park and five plus airport parking\nThere are several outside airport parking choices around Hartsfield Jackson airport that only use one I use park and fly plus I Choose park and five plus because they offer more than just parking while you're away you can have your oil changed by jade de loop or have your car wash them detailed\nPark and fly plus features covered and valet parking onsite baggage check in if you're flying with delta and pet ...\nParadise resort at the park to apply plush offices camp creek parkway\nThey pick you up in five minutes or less you go straight through security when you get to the airport it's a great way to beat some of the hassles joined at first when Parker programming or free parking and use your card is you're gay key for easy and France an accent\nAnd don't forget you can guarantee your parking in advance by reserving on line at P.

E. N. S. S. L. E. R. dot com Dr Jean ... dot com\nOr you can go or question hotline one eight five five forty nine nine one six six so guys um got another question here new from ball ground\nUh asks if I'm delaying receiving Social Security benefits\nShould I still sign up for Medicare at age sixty five so and that kind of ties in with our situation we were talking about earlier sure does are you guys got up and you know it's it's the\nQuestion's a little vague so I definitely want to talk to me a little bit more in depth about why you're delaying sort of because yeah if you are continuing to work and you have healthcare coverage than there could be benefit for maybe delaying rider Medicare\nI'm generally is going to be free for ... days so why not sign up go go and sign up for re potentially sign up for me I don't again depends on what's happening that will give us the details on that but if you delay\nYou can definitely delay but if he started delaying be and you should have signed up then there can be a premium increase when you decided to sign up and you know if you missed that we are and then you'll depending on the reason why you're delaying could depend on how much you're actually going to pay in that increase improvement 'cause I Believe it's up to ten percent\nOf of an increase which will be there ever so yeah\nYeah you you look at you do the math and let and the perpetrator that can be a really meaningful ... exact\nSo I'd like to know why you're delaying but I think yes I mean there's no reason you know if you're if you're able to get the the at least a for free and you're currently working you can delay getting be\nBut if it's in good reason and they will Medicare answer all those questions worry for sure but I think yeah go ahead and sign up and let's at least call and let's have a conversation as to why exactly and if you\nDo have the insurance through your employer check with them through 'cause a lot of um if you're eligible for Medicare they're going to try to push you to do that so that they become secondary insurance for\nUh that potentially and so it's important to try to coordinate because you know if if not I mean they're still gonna be it's extra coverage right they do coordinated benefits so maybe if you still have a twenty percent copay through your your job based insurers\nIt may be putting the two together may actually help you cover more of your insurance costs to cheer or so it it does need to be coordinated I ... I mean we gotta we gotta talk to a little bit more but uh you can you can still ...\nEven if you have a secondary I don't know we talk about it with clients all the time being with Medicare to secondary coverage right so you you have to insurance coverage to that point which most people never have than eat right but we've also seen clients having them you know\nSickness they deter backed ... can help cover or car accident\nThan health coverage so you know what even with cost rousing later oh yeah I'm just you know a option it's not a bad idea right to to just go ahead and sign up even if you're working for a few more months and you just don't want to\nDo want to do it I think it's a good idea to have the conversation going it it does take some time to get enrolled so start the enrollment process and and you know give us a call let's talk through our could do\nA got another one here Tyler from Sandy Springs rights and man has ever a great topic at the moment or like the S. and P. five hundred my portfolio is overweight in technology I really want to pay back in position myself more defensively good job that's yeah we want to hear or do I keep a one or two big names\nLike alphabet IBM or ... apple or do I go for an ATF to ride the sector so\nHere's the thing uh I think he has to become so popular and or their performance over the last nine years it's been awesome relative to active management in fact it's actually\nGotten to the point where a lot of folks will say what's the reason that you would ever want to have active manager manager portfolio ATF beat it all the time\nWell they beat it sometimes I'll tell you there's only upside anger management is generally more conservative than the overall index and the reason that they are this way as a group and I know all of them aren't but you know as a group they generally tend to be um\nBecause they have this thing in the back of their mind it's called\nAsset preservation you know just because you made a bunch of money if there is a downturn and unexpected a dip in the market they don't want to participate in that piece near as much so they positioned themselves so that they're a bit more conservative\nSo if it were me and you're looking to reposition and everything's up in the air obviously there are some reasons why you might want to consider using an active manager a a a a mutual fund would be a way to do that and now there's some good ones out there\nAre in the technology sector they only focus on that sector or you could use an exchange traded funds so um you know there's few funds that you could consider um one of them is a ticker symbol I why W which is a I shared us technology\nUm it actually tracks the Dow Jones not the S. and P. so it hasn't appreciated quite as much as a as the S. and P. would have\nA you can go with the vanguard both these are going to be really low expense ratio ... um [noise] but uh let me see if I can get these pages apart and I'll tell you exactly what the ticker is um but the thing is the the vanguard version has actually done better the T. V. Gigi\nExactly thank you DJ and um one thing that I'll tell you this if you have enough money if your assets are sufficient that you could diversify using individual stocks and let's face it\nIf you just have ten thousand dollars invested you probably are going to be better to go with something that is by a portfolio not a stock portfolio is going to be either an exchange traded fund or mutual fund\nIf you've got enough money to diversify yourself in individual stocks especially if you're using a taxable account I Would prefer to see you do that right and there's a reason we're good one yes absolutely so if you have individual securities that you've purchased\nAnd you see a decline in one of them while the others are going up or maybe you see a decline and all\nYou can actually realize those losses during the year and get a break on your taxes\nThat you can't necessarily do that I mean I've talked about this before on the show as the five hundred quite often is up for the year\nBut more often than not you've got a big chunk sometimes as much or more than twenty five percent of the individuals securities that are in the U.S and be five hundred if you just don't want to eat the F in its up guess what you got a new law says if you own the individual securities underline\nYou can clean those losses in the year you still get again overall if your portfolio relatively closely tracks the U.S and the five hundred but guess what you got a tax break and the game yeah what's the lie what's not to like about that or I guess\nThat's a sign of the end of our show what do you think mark it up or down actually CJ I'm old enough\n[noise]\nApps events contests promotions and on demand audio\nThat Philip brought his little brother on our mission into orbit\nNow I Can't believe how easy it was a project ... on my car insurance would die cow\nThat's backing down and that's what I Do\nBelieve that guy go could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance\nOn your smartphone freedom to hunter Android app store\nGet interact with one of the answer [noise]\nMark Davis in for us this week in the town hall review brought to you in partnership with Pepperdine graduate school of public policy an ATF the alliance defending freedom of close up of that caravan of migrants\nThese people are not refugees you they're not being persecuted by their governments\nShowing this route program and visit our website at town hall review dot com [noise]\nAll summer seeking asylum and Mexico most of them appear to be continuing the difficult track toward our borders so what happens when and if they reach the U.S that's anybody's guess President Trump is promising to protect citizens from what some describe as an invasion\nJohnson Iraq is senior editor of the stream he's been monitoring the migration and he spoke with said little host than a Springer you make the point that\nGift giving that that they're fleeing theoretically the persecution this may be first in history where the country are fleeing persecution from you march with their flag\nRight right I I said I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt this gracefully turned back Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany\nThey weren't out waving Nazi flags and singing German nationalist songs and talking about how they're going to transform English us in the U.S and Germany damage I mean that the people are mixing up the Jewish refugees in Germany with the German American button you know\nUm these people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by their governments\nThere they're just living in kinda crappy countries\nYou know and those countries are crappy for a reason uh for historical and cultural and political reasons that 'cause they never embraced ordered liberty they um they ... they inherited a bad dictatorial political culture from Spain uh whereas we inherited\nA kind of anti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England\nAnd as a result they have worse government's worse economies they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things there's a great Latin American economists her ... her and I think his name is Fernando ... or ... I think it's ...\nSoto was found out\nThis photo and he said if you enforce property rights for the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from thugs and from ... drug lords Latin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence of it\nThey were fleeing to America and we have a huge welfare magnet a lot of these people even if they they come in and start working their kids will grow up properly at public assistance large percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away refugees get a get a honey pot full of benefits from the government\nSo why don't you think is going to happen when they reach the American border\nWell my hope is that we will have the U.S military lined up and choking off the entire border and I think President Trump ... he's already said this is a national emergency he should start using defense funds to start constructing the law\nYou ought to lay the he ought to lay the cornerstone of the wall gold plated with the big tea on it\nAnd start building the wall let Congress scream and yell what\nJudges scream and yell he should for\nTheir court orders and continue to use as authorities commander in chief to seal the border and ... and take money away from guarding Afghanistan's border if necessary to guard at the United states border that's what we elected him for we didn't like\nJeb Bush we didn't elect Nikki Haley we elected Donald Trump because we wanted to put America First ah if we're going to be global policemen you know a charity begins at home\nAnd there's a crucial point I think because they're sick people feel a sense of moral mall in ...\nOh these people they just want to improve their lives okay first of all that is true of half the world if you are going to say that you if you pick up in Honduras and said this sucks I'm outta here I'm going to the U.S up if that is enough to get it went to the U. S. gets what most of the Islamic world would like to come to\nVirtually everyone in China would like to come I bet Bangladesh Pakistan you could empty the world in the United states and our welfare system will be bankrupt within you know\nThirty six hours but hey at least we feel good about ourselves as we you know starve to death and watched a civil war overwhelm our country and turn it into what I call a caucus and like so many other parts of the world but what about the moral argument\nThink we should see our country as a larger extension of our private homes if ... if somebody bangs on your door and said these homeless and demands to live in your living room you have a right to shut the door and use whatever forces required\nTo stop someone for staying in your house and eating your food against your will the exact same thing occurs applies to us as a country is our country of coming home\nThat we work on and we improve and we leave to our children were grateful our grandparents we lead to our children we judiciously accept newcomers or something to offer or are we just a giant refugee camp like the ones we see you you know and\nTurkey and Jordan where anybody who shows up you have to take him in and you put them on the same girl and given the same uniform and they and they gather around the same trash you know trash cans with a fire is that the future of America\nTo me politically\nThis is gonna happen presumably right before the incredibly important congressional elections right and uh I I I I worry given the butter bias of the media\nThat we will just have video after video and photo after photo of some American either military person or ice personal border guard up pushing some mom with a baby and\nThen uh it's it's it seems to me they win the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and then suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets in at a George Soros funded attorney\nWill know that that's not to forgive me John that's not the propaganda war that swimming the war I agree but the propaganda war you know I may I just don't want to let me let me just breaking point\nIt seemed to me that they win if they get in and the women if they don't get\nIt and I don't because if they are good I Hope you're right I I there's no ... ... you're right\nI think if Trump shows weakness\nIf he tapes then Republicans across the country we just our hearts saying we realized the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status\nIf even Donald Trump can't say no to something that is ludicrous and politically cooked up\nThen we're we're toast and I think that would depress turnout\nLine I I agree with you I agree with you I just I agree with you I\nDo I think if shot dance from the U.S if you have to learn\nThat that will mean in picture in pictorial form that they will be fights between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us [noise] because I think people see\nThat this is an invasion they can see it the people who are going to cry\nBecause a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back those people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out for for for otherwise going to turn out this is a national impeachment referendum\nThe less space has already fanatical they've got their their ... ready they're ready to go to the polls they've got their dead people registered to vote but left is all ready at its maximum frenzy and hysteria they've maxed out\nWhat the Kavanaugh hearings did was wake up the Republican base a wake up the patriotic Americans who say wait a minute they're just they're threatening our system of government that destroying an orange adjusted oh and now they're bringing in contested doors to transform country demographically

suspicious packages at least one it was a real bomb out of the president's commitments to vice presidents condemned Rod Rosenstein condemned I'm sure you're going to condemn it\nBut the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy it's either some not in the basement where it's a hospital power messing with our election but what do you make can be attempt to blame Trump\nI Love it if the media dealing with the media does which which is any any narrative that they can twist against Trump they will do so and this is ... this is terrorism and whoever the terrorists as\nI Need to be ... you need to be prosecuted needs to be put in jail for a long long time\nAnd a an up and it that'll happen you know it's interesting

Woodrow Wilson who was running against him was so a compelled as Theodore Roosevelt\nCampaigning on this idea of a new nationalism that he came up with his own program called the new freedom in any event there is nothing wrong with the term nationalism is there\nLike if you look at the dictionary or you just Google or anything it look it up what are the synonym for nationalism here the first three Senate\nPatriotism patriotic feeling and flag waving okay\nIs there something wrong with that I I Am not entirely comfortable with President Trump using the term global is derisive Lee I don't know anyone I honestly do not know anyone who describes himself or herself as a global as\nA and a a ... and ... and that's a word that's problematic that that's but that's not what people are freaking out about\nWhat people are freaking out of that as president from saying he's a nationalist for instance here is Don Lemon reacting almost in real time just a moment after President Trump dropped the N. word Don Lemon on CNN [noise]\nUsed that word we're going to talk about that word tonight it is a favorite of All right and is loaded with native is and racial undertones and global as well global is I've been uses a slur\nOf sorts sometimes even against those and the administration is often with anti Semitic overtone\nWhat's just happened to make president come right out and embrace nationalism\nOkay what is the problem with nationalism a a nationalist\nOr nationalism and this is a again common definition a personal advocates Political Independence for country patriotic feeling principles are efforts an extreme form of this especially marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries\nThen a patriot her patriotism that's listed as a person who vigorously supports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies are detractors vigorous support for one's country in other words that's why patriot patriotism is listed as a synonym for nationalism\nAnd um do I think this is may be part of a political strategy for him to help a push the Republicans over the line and hold the house of representatives and some of these furious house races\nI kind of thing from just set it but maybe it is maybe it is and I'll tell you why because for ordinary Americans I I mean basically the people who live in this country and yes that includes those all important suburban women\nYou hear that the president said I'm a nationalist ... what is so terrible about that and uh the\nChrysalis are rights on his face Trump seemed to be simply saying that well past presidents and politicians cared a lot about other countries and what other countries thought about the United states\nThat he cares primarily about us and what is good for us the problem of course is that words matter and the American president referring to himself as a nationalist has all sorts of problems wrapped up in it\nLet's start with what nationalism means\nHere's the definition that he found that says quote a sense of national consciousness exhausting one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on the promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or super national groups\nProblem there\nBut we do not elect a president of the United states to be a citizen of the world or a public servant for the world we do not we elect a president to represent the United states\nTo defend our country and to defend our constitution and yes to defend our culture and there is such a thing as American culture now the term white nationalist\nOr if I dare say so the term black nationalist which is also a time that that's a problem let me tell you why it's a problem because what that suggests is that your ...\nNation is something other than the United states the United states obviously has nationalist about America patriots who serve our country who fight for our country who worked for our country of every racial religious\nAnd or ethnic background it it it does\nAnd the idea that there is something racist about saying I Am a nationalist America specifically and from the beginning has always been a nation\nThat has not define our nationalism or our nationality based upon race or blood or where you were born\nI mean going all the way back to before the revolution the idea was you could become an American by choice by picking yourself up and moving here and embracing the American idea\nAnd we've always had that we've always had that\nAnd you know we have we talked on this show many times and and it is true it is documented nobody argues against is close to ten percent and maybe over ten percent of the continental army that fought with George Washington for our liberty\nWhere people of color they were black people mostly former slaves because that's why they were here\nAnd the idea of this and the French there actually recorded descriptions of when the French arrived to work with the Americans at Yorktown\nOne of the reasons they look down on the American army was not only not speak the uniforms and the French were about nothing if not if uniforms but because there were so many people of different complex and in that army [noise] one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nI think that a a great core of people on the Republican side said not that\nNo and we have to come together and fight it\nAnd that's why this rhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism it seems to me\nI don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a nationalist and let me explain to there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named ... and it's it's worth ...\nSo during because one of the points he makes is that nationalism goes pretty directly\nWith the idea of democracy because if you're talking about a nation state is your real tried than the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America is what patriotism means is that I find myself as an American\nAnd going back to a theater Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was if you are an immigrant you drop the idea of carrying the flag of your former country you carry the American flag and your nationalism your tribal affiliations what you care about what what do you and give your heart to is our nation\nNot a race not an ethnicity and the fact that that there are so many people out there and the commentary and and so many Democrats who don't get that who are offended by the term nationalism I honestly don't think that's helping the Democratic side\nI think of anything it helps on\nThe conservative and Republican side by the way if you're one of those people just offended by the word nationalism\nGive me a call and tell me why\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six uh Michael in San Diego you're on the Michael made that show\nYou know I I'm a I think that uh America is neither a a a country founded on nationalism nor international is a more global is\nHow can you say that we weren't hounded on nationalism a we weren't found it on an individual is nationalism or no no I'm\nSorry we weren't we were founded by a lot of people who came together to a risk\nTheir lives and in many cases to give their lives at twenty five thousand people who signed the revolution give their lives for the cause of the ... a nation not not a school board a nation stay with me if I Want to let you answer back a will continue what's wrong with nationalism\nHonestly
