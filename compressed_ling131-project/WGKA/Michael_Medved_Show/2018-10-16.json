I Know when you're finished it was finished the thing of the ... really interesting okay because what they basically want is they want a mathematical equation to explain where our universe come from\nIf our universe can be shown to be a reasonably probable outcome of what they call the quantum wave equation or the ... ... corn way function then they think they will have explained the universe but one of the more astute proponents of\nQuantum cosmology Alexander ... said well wait a minute\nMath were saying that math is basically producing material universe but he says math is something that exists in a mind or we therefore saying that the material universe there's actually a mind\nAnd that's not a very congenial a conclusion because it's basically a materialistic Lee inspired cosmology the other thing that's really strange is that in order to solve the equation that gives you a universal wave function out of which our universe might be a reasonably probable outcome\nThe the the a theoretical physicist has to impose were called boundary constraints on the degrees of mathematical freedom of this equation which is actually in hurting information into the map to get the outcome they want\nSo they're actually modeling the need an unexplained infusion of information to get the universe so even if you get mad or out of math you you still can't get the information needed to produce the universe for the anywhere you can't get around them in the beginning was the word\nSo go on on the big bang yeah yeah so there's there's a number of these materialistic cosmology that are trying to circumvent\nThe clear an obvious implication of the big bang which is that the universe the material universe a physical universe headed definite beginning in time space matter and energy hocking in ten rows approve this was something called the singularity there I'm In the late sixties there's been an additional proof of this called the board goose the Lincoln Theater him\nAnd uh the physicists and cosmologists have been going crazy trying to ... should try to find a way to circumvent this conclusion hawking himself worked on circumventing his own proof he was the originator of this cosmological idea that crosses popularized\nBut it doesn't really work for the reasons I've specified and then there's another version of this\nWhere they want a it's called the inflationary cosmology were have one big bang after another big bang after another big bank it was mainly designed to circumvent the problem of the fine tuning of the universe\nBut what what is the the odd a irony of that whole effort is that the mechanism by which you would get the multiple big bangs itself has to be exquisitely fine tuned to tend to die\nAnyway there's no evidence for and there's no evidence these are entirely speculative cosmological models cash that in the multi verse or for greater leaps of faith and we believe in God right\nI gave a talk on this the other night here in Southern California and I remember the thing from Alice in wonderland says sticks impossible things before breakfast yeah\nWell the the the the these natural cosmology force you to posit multiple uh abstract explanatory entities ... ton fields ... shut up energy strings multi dimensions of space to explain the very low on the one God would\nExplain what's on energy field\nWithin a Springer show live from the relief factor pain free studios [noise]\nNight twenty the answer\nThat is pretty good here for ... at the American federal rare coin and bullying for years I've been recommending precious metal dealers but I wasn't sure where to turn when I wanted to make a change to my own\nPortfolio strategy so I reached out to my good friend Michael ... he's been personally working with Nick ... at American federal for years and I couldn't be happier with Michael's recommendation I was able to speak and work directly with American federals owner in ...

on tape and you can hear it ah she did say that it was fine she had no problem with people going over to Afghanistan and fighting with the Taliban\nThat's against people like the opponents of this particular would be senator we'll talk about that race will talk about another race where a democratic campaign to re elected US Senator has just about collapsed and with it perhaps\nThe Fort Lauren hopes of the Democrats to capture the U.S Senate and meanwhile the house races very very much\nUp for grabs and uh there is every attempt to try to use everything at hand right now this is like a bar fight and that's what happens in the last couple of weeks with the campaign that's why people talk about October surprises\nA because people will grab hold of anything of a bottle or a chair or um anything that you can find an ashtray and you throw it near her let me see what hurts and you see what sticks that's the stage of the campaign were in\nAnd what that means is that even when there is a gruesome assassination\nOf a a Saudi journalist and by the way he's not an American citizen he was living in the United states he had come to we're talking about ...\nUh and I'm not even sure how you pronounce this in proper Arabic I'd always thought it was ... but a lot of people are saying ... ...\nBut whichever way he's was chopped up into a lot of different pieces and his body apparently was brought back to Saudi Arabia\nIs not a nice thing it's a terrible thing that had happened and if you listen to CNN who's to blame\nLoved Trump of course why I'm Brian Steltzner was on with Fred Hyatt on CNN and this is what Brian Steltzner had to say\nTo lure someone to a consulate to December the body and to take it back to Saudi but it is a crime of a different caliber ah I Wonder if you look at what's happened the last five days and you wonder if\nEnemy of the people rhetoric not just from President Trump but also then from other world leaders has anything to do with anything at all\nOkay what what uh\nThis Trump's rhetoric has to do with the actions of Saudi Arabia I yes we are aligned with Saudi Arabia and yes we need to be there's a powerful because by Walter Russell Mead the wall Street Journal today that make that case\nBut the attempt to\nBlame the killing of this Muslim Brotherhood affiliated journalists\nTo attend to blame that killing on President Trump or on his rhetoric is is just absurd\nOf the people who listen to Trump's rhetoric and cheer it when he takes on fake news are not murderers and they are by and large not Saudi Arabian ah meanwhile this was the response from Fred Hyatt on CNN too uh that charge\nIn a case like this with important through on the actual crime or to keep focus on the actual criminal and you know\nThe Washington Post were very focused thing we've got to get the facts and then there has to be accountability and there has to be consequences [noise]\nI think there is a larger picture which was also fair to look at which is that a dictator is around the world feel emboldened when you have proven reaching out to Britain to poison his enemies when you have China\nReaching out to Hong Kong and elsewhere to kidnap people they perceived to be their enemies and went in each case is proposing enemies are peaceful ah\nYou know people who have done absolutely nothing wrong or you have to ask why is this happening and I do think is happening in part because the United states is retreating from its traditional role as a leader in the world and standing up for democratic values and including freedom of expression\nOkay that's fair enough I mean the idea that there should be no us retreat and you need to establish norms and rules of law by the way of course they forgot about North Korea is North Korean our good buddy you may remember\nThat I'm Kim Jong on a ... it also abroad had his half brother a murder\nBecause he might be dissenting from the regime look this is one of those things that there is obvious concern about and it's bipartisan and it should be a Lindsey Graham who's become one of the strongest supporters for the administration in the United States Senate had a\nHad this to say on Fox and friends about the cars show gay killing\nI Know there's nothing happened in Saudi Arabia without NBS knowing it who's in the he's the thirty three year old crown prince who jumped him over other people have to sort of the existing came and I think he's on a on a bad track\nI can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind us and what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia as long as this guy's in charge you're selling the crown prince has to leave this up to them but I'm not going to I've been their biggest offender on the floor of the United states that this guy is a wrecking ball\nHe had just gotten murdered in a conflict in Turkey and to expect me to ignore it I feel used and abused I was on the floor every time defending Saudi Arabia because there is a good ally there's a difference between a country an individual thing NBS figure\nThis to me toxic he can never be a world leader on the world and what does the president did thank us up to the ... but what I Would do I know what I'm going to do want to sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYou know we do bad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended\nThey have nothing but contempt for us would you put a guy like me and the president in this box for after all the president has done this guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia listening there are a lot of good people you can choose the NBS his tainted your country and painted himself like\nOkay this is probably not the right approach frankly because you have the situation in the country where the crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nOr is are in power because his father is old an ailing and uh I'm not sure that there is a power structure in place in Saudi Arabia that can simply replace him right now\nAnd there's a find peace in the wall Street Journal I mentioned by Walter Russell Mead the headline is don't ditch Riyad in a fit of righteousness\nAnd he makes the point now we have to deal with these people and I I don't\nThink anybody would say that we shouldn't go forward with some kind of a deal with Kim Jong on which remains one of the most promising\nA diplomatic initiatives of the Trump Administration so far uh nor should we simply write all Saudi Arabia or there's breaking news the Washington Post is reporting that um\nThat President Trump spoke directly to the crown prince to Mohammed bin Salman apparently he was ... together the crown prince was meeting with secretary of state Mike Pompeo and he may have handed uh the phone he was on the phone with President Trump to a mom and men Solomon\nAnd according to the president the crown prince totally denied any knowledge of what happened to counseling turkey\nAny promises answers shortly ... disappearance\nA secretary of state Pompeo press the Saudi leaders to move quickly with a transparent investigation of the disappearance of democracy hoagie and yes it sounds like a truly awful business he he comes into conflict\nBecause he wants to get papers he needs so that he can get married his fiance is waiting in the car outside now he'd never came out of that council it or at least they never came out in one piece they brought in a\nAn expert with the bone song they brought in an expert in autopsies they apparently packaged the various little pieces of his body and sent them back to Saudi Arabia this is a bad thing\nIs it that offends\nEven the norms of state misbehavior but then again Mohammed bin Salman has a I'm a real problem also\nWith the with the policy that's going on in Yemen\nAnd the uh against the Saudis are basically looking out for the American for American interests and standing up against the Iranians who are the ones who would really stand to gain if there was some kind of big break between the United states and Saudi Arabia which I emphatically hope there won't be\nBut something has to be done with a show of arresting people who were behind this killing and making it clear that is not approved of or authorized by the government one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you remember\nMay remember that um [noise] last year the Saudis kidnapped they well they arrested the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri\nOf that was a disaster they all said this failed diplomatic confrontation with cops are\nWhich was a disaster we need a stable productive and strong

money from the federal treasury deposited directly into the bank accounts of their most ardent political supporters to the bay and several generations of their descendants will have the resources to

called the Jefferson Jackson day dinner\nAnd named after the two founders as it used to be told of the Democratic party Thomas Jefferson\nWho started the Democratic Republican Party and then Andrew Jackson who started the modern Democratic Party problem with those two guys they were both slave owners [laughter]\nAnd be time slave owners hundreds of slice so they changed the last year the name of the Jefferson Jackson day party to another illiterate of name\nIt became the Kennedy Clinton day dinner\nOkay that's a little bit of a problem and hash tag me to do you think that I Know Hillary says that President Clinton had no abuse of power he was during the driven snow\nBut you think that John Kennedy and Bill Clinton each have a a little bit of a problem and the view of feminist by the way feminist had a very very important anniversary they celebrated we will get to that um so what are they change it to\nMe what democratic region of our Lyndon Johnson they they have Lyndon Johnson on

know what they did as the Eleanor Roosevelt there\nI'm Eleanor Roosevelt never got elected anything she was a very bright lady um she was ... I can you imagine\nBecause he can't do Kennedy Clinton you can't do Jefferson Jackson the Eleanor Roosevelt said dinner maybe maybe they could make it the um Pocahontas dinner in the future\nAlthough actually now the the entire nickname for Senator Elizabeth\nWarren or who is up there in New England the entire nickname should go back to what it originally was I mean the the the nickname that she was given was ... ... that's ... phony as an essay you X\nAnd a President Trump should apply that name to her very directly this is one thing that she has\nAccomplished something amazing here she really has the United the country [noise] United the country in ... volition against her why is that\nWell if you just have to listen to some of the responses and why it is that President Trump should not must not have heard of that million dollars which the wall Street Journal strangely says he should pay\nWill get to that and more with your calls coming up on the ...

fourth\nA Native American\nNo really ... by the way let's take the best case analysis based upon the DNA tests and everyone should understand that that no one can accept these DNA tests because very

backed off that no but she won't she basically insists that uh this is the way she's going to set up her presidential campaign my question to you\nWould be was she thinking why is this\nIdea it makes her look ridiculous and make sure looked like a liberal racist why do I say that\nBecause for goodness sake if you grow up in a situation where you never affiliated with the tribe no one in your whole family within memory is ever affiliated with the tribe you've never gone to India and events you haven't raised with any Indian culture you know nothing about Indian history or background\nYou have no connection no affiliation no participation know communal involvement with the native\nAmerican community and ah then when you get hired a pen and a Harvard you put down that your ethnicity is Native American\nBecause that modifies you as a diversity hire\nI mean the whole thing is sad now is it the end of the world no it's not the end of the world but she is making at the end of her campaign she is blowing herself up and she chose to do this thing this would be a good idea\nOr does she really saying she should get the million dollars that President Trump by the way did not promise here is what that is based\nOn where a that's number three they're under Warren audio Jeremy where where President Trump makes the original offer to senator walk and he's doing a rally in Montana or over the summer listen I won't\nMillion dollars for your favorite charity\nIf you take a test of their shows your\nOkay and it shows you're an Indian right but\nThe uh ... that whole idea shows\nUrine Indian means that you would be accepted by some kind of try and there is no try them in the country the looks of someone with one sixty fourth Indian blood as an Indian\nAnd they do require you to be an enrolled member of any tried to actually show that yes you have a personal history that has involved you or someone in your family or someone in your background she has none of that\nAnd so she can't\nCollect the million dollars in the wall Street Journal is wrong and that the um Wall Street journal and he should tell you what their editorials said and why I think they are wrong and seriously wrong about this it's fat\nOr they basically suggest that Trump would look good if he just paid or the money\nAnd I'm ... years was the what they say in a their editorial they say right to check Donald you'll look gracious and you'll have them using talking points photograph it will last the entire two thousand twenty campaign\nShe says I'm miss Warren now says Mr Trump should make good on his ... to write a million dollar check to charity and miss Warren proved she had Native American blood he\nDidn't say she had to prove she has a Native American a bloody said she had to show she was an Indian\nAnd venture and if he doesn't do this he's ... what you\nCall in and give her right [laughter] or an Indian better I'm as Lindsey Graham actually spoke on this he was willing to uh each going forward with his own DNA test and he's going to out Native American Elizabeth Warren here's what Senator Graham and to say\nIt was before and it has she could be anywhere from sixty fourth to one thousand Native American you have a challenge I'm going to take a DNA test all of you have I've been told him our grandmother was far Cherokee Indian it may all be just talk\nBut you've got to find out in a couple of weeks 'cause I'm going to take this new we're gonna take it I'm taking it and the result is going to be revealed here\nThis is my ... this is our fate anyway I just I'm dying to know how did I you know I didn't really think much about it but she is less than one tenth of one percent I think I can Vader I think I can beat her to breeder will us for a million dollars from the president to know what a casino enemy about\nOkay he wants a casino and a million bucks uh\nI've good luck with that Lindsey or by the way you can you imagine how are the headlines and some of the more left leaning papers was South Carolina senator says he wants to beat\nHis colleague from Massachusetts\nAre abusing woman again really ... by the way it does this have anything at all to do with feminism are hashtags made too if you think it does you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six looks the one thing that a Senator Warren I think established is a\nA really bringing Americans together and uh and lose busters put together a collage showing the way that major networks including some that are usually reliably liberal reacted to this Elizabeth Warren ploy\nThe Cherokee Nation criticized Warren's announcement saying that are used to be in a test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage beyond a lot of people questioning whether this revelation really did when her\nAt any point for this and the reason it's controversial when she was at Harvard law school and when she was at the University of Pennsylvania she represented herself as Native American sheep contributed to a Native American cookbook\nCalled powwow chow\n\nCherokee the Cherokee Nation called the president's attacks ... but it's also criticizing Warren things she is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage adding a DNA test is useless current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America in the video war\nAnd so she respects the difference between family history and tribal affiliation not enrolled in and try and you know only trying to determine tribal citizenship and\nOh boy oh boy\nOh boy is right I mean really what was the losers Warren thinking and what is her side of this\nIs their side of this not that I see a there was a um Cherokee Nation secretary of state and yes it is a separate nation officially I was on CNN with Jake Tapper and Chuck ... junior had this to say\nThe problem with the DNA test as it it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person as a citizen of the Indian nation a member of an Indian nation\nDNA as best I can give you some indicators of some markers that are indicate that you're related to somebody who live long ago that may have lived in North and South America may have been a native peoples of those continents\nUm it's irrelevant to what it means to be a Native American in this country that that's the base that's based on a legal definition certainly every tribe has that in common that we have some legal basis for citizenship that we determine consistent with federal trainees\nJust holy unhelpful for any national later to cling to DNA to determine the or to those tablets that their Native American in this country\nAnd by the way it doesn't really establish require DNA there was a very famous American and he's a featured character in my book the American miracle named Sam Houston and Sam Houston was an official member of the Cherokee tribe why not\nBecause he was born that way but because he went and they live with the Cherokees and he worked with them and he was adopted by a local chief and he learned the language and he was deeply involved themselves a Senator Warren and your free time after you lose your presidential race\nMaybe you could explore your post Cherokee heritage of one one thousand and twenty fourth maybe from an ancestor two hundred and fifty years ago we will get to that issue and the more with your calls one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six we'll be right back\nI I Will say that President Trump has told outright lives things that he knows not to be true because he's been told but where is there an outright lie here on this issue\n[noise] I you know he said find out if you have I don't know exactly what he said\nBut I mean let me play oriented he should he oh what's her that million dollars ... ... I Am going to let me let\nMe play it for you okay I just want to be fair here listen to what President Trump said here's President Trump's original offered over Elizabeth Warren\nDollars charity\nFor backup if you take the test because it shows you're\nOkay if it shows you're an Indian and my point here was that there is no Indian tribe in the world and the country would accept her as an Indian based upon this DNA test that shows that she may\nHave had one great great great great grandfather who was then\nThat's my only point\nJust want to say that I'm from your caller and uh and the previous hour said Trump that brought us down to the gutter he really has and I mean you guys I I'm just so\nI'm a let me let me let you let me ask you\nThis okay do you think that it is honorable of for Elizabeth Warren to have a promoted herself as a diversity hire to have contributed to an Indian cookbook to have gone through this masquerade for all this time\n[noise] no I don't think she should have done that I look at it it was trivial and it shouldn't have done it but I'll tell you what Trump calls out women he called he'd said Dr forward it doesn't matter and she was lying or not we and we want it that's all he cares about winning and he didn't care who he dumped on\nOkay look I Believe that President Trump does sometimes go way over the line I think it's unfortunate and I said it already on the show\nI think it was a big mistake on his part and it was inappropriate for him to attack Stormy Daniels who has made accusations of intimate kind against him two attackers horse face at a put that in a tweet today\nUm it's probably we probably reached a point in our world where if you're going to be attacking a female and you can attack or the way President Trump is attacking the foreign but don't attack or looks I think we can agree on that\nAnd Pam I appreciate your calling me and caring enough about the show to actually call even with a complaint [noise] the point is that the fact that\nA Trump or a can a\nOccasionally makes mistakes I Would never say he can do no wrong but it's wrong to say he can do no rice we will be right back on the met that show\n[noise] am nine twenty the answer\n[noise] for the Bible\nI Do in Washington or weddings structured on Wall street ...

fifth president President Trump deserves applause and support and banking when he leads American the right direction\nAnd I think much of the time he does but\nThe idea that his personality should be the big issue that determines how we respond on this direction I'll tell you a way that I think Democrats are going to mess themselves over by trying to do that the American people don't want an impeachment crisis\nAnd and you have Democrats now who have promised that if they take the house they're going to try to impeach President Trump's are going to try to breach justice Kevin aren't really\nThat helps the country how it doesn't at all and it's absurd\nLet's go to Doug in Houston Doug you're on the Michael ...\nMichael Michael you bet yeah that should be some money I'm he made it\nMade a statement in a statement that ... million dollars that proved that she was an Indian yeah she was one one thousand twenty fourth any answer should give out nine dollars and thirty eight that\nI'm sure you've done the math but the problem is he he basically said she needs to show she's an Indian and what that means is how do you define who is an Indian now\nIn the URL Nuremberg Laws and Nazi Germany this was on the go find out about the ... movie\nUh they used against someone who is Jewish who is eligible for execution and liquidation if you had one sixteenth\nA Jewish background now she doesn't close to that\nOne sixteenth Jewish background means what is it it means a great great grandparents she has to go back to great great great great that's for great great grandparents a hundred and fifty years\nAnd it's absurd she cannot prove that she's an Indian she cannot show that she's in India and therefore I think it would be wrong for President Trump to even pay the one thousand one one thousand and twenty fourth of it appreciate your calling and your sentiments Sean San Diego you're on the Michael ... show\nYeah you made um you've had a comment earlier and question whether it was racist or not or their racism involved in calling her Pocahontas\nWhen and I think it is racially insensitive EPA very nice to have one of her percentage were the same to show for

Rachel dollars on you remember Rachel dollars on who pretended to be back black\nYeah OK it would probably not be received well in the Pocahontas thing hasn't been received well but if the cold or\nRachel dollars all Harriet Tubman or if he called her by the name of some black hero 'cause Pocahontas was not a bad person she was a good person she's somebody who's remembered fondly in American history for goodness sake if you look at that Disney movie\nOh she paints with all the colors and the when I I I Do not understand why when President Trump's whole point about Elizabeth Warren\nIs that she's a phony\nThat it's insulting for him to use the name of a one of the most famous Native Americans in our history\nOr to make fun of her now do I think he should save he's going to say it'd

as much Indiana's one sixty fourth\nWe are angry women are angry supposedly angry about\nChristine Blasey Ford an angry about ... me too and angry about powerful men and angry most of all about President Trump remember the resist\nA moment okay there are tons of angry women out there and right now in the media mind they are led by Hillary Rodham Clinton again that went well a end by Elizabeth Warren yeah that's going well and here's my basic question\nAside from the personalities of some of these angry women there's a new book and I haven't read it but it just amazes me that they've published a book and think this is going to really speak to this moment in our history is by someone named Rebecca Traister\nAnd it's called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nUh-huh\n... what is the power of women's anger and what's the purpose of that women's anger let's say for justice of the sake of argument and I'm Serious I Will let you express this please\nLet's say that this record number of women who are running for office on the Democratic side there's also record numbers wasn't running on the Republican side but leave that alone for a moment let's say all these angry democratic women\nWin and they come sweeping into Congress what's gonna happen next\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six how will it make America better how old it\nEnrich our life as a nation or one of the\nPoints that Gerald science make in his column today most Street Journal\nIn that leads it's more likely not ... and\nThere will be a divided outcome in this election ... says look it's possible that the Republicans will hold on in the house and they'll definitely hold on the Senate\nAnd and yes that's possible it's also possible some likely but it's possible that the Democrats will make the house that they could easily do and take this and that that's going to be much harder for them\nBut the most likely outcome that the Republicans hold the Senate probably adding to our set majority and the Democrats take the house narrowly\nSo what does that look like\nThey're all sides says is that looks like and even more divided America even more bitterness even more constant nonsense about the end of the world and and this happens and then we can go on and this was the end of America as we know it more apocalyptic\nInsanity the American people really want that\nIf you're voting for the angry women now they're ... let me just give you some flavor of this this is the way that this new book good and mad as written\nAbout [noise] uh just the Meyer says uh\nAs it's lots of pardon and fluffy Meyer says in USA Today as America grapples with the hash tag me too movement tidal wave Rebecca Traister his new book good and mad
