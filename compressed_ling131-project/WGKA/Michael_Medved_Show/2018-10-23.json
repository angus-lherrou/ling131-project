I'm ... I'm a nationalist too I I Am and I I don't understand why people should have a problem with that word if you want to try to answer that question you can one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nLook I um I just finished my very [laughter] lengthy too lengthy I'm afraid chapter on Theodore Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt is regularly rated as one of the greatest of all American presidents he's on Mount Rushmore\nWhen he ran for president in Nineteen twelve\nHe called his program the new nationalism\nAnd uh that was and then and then ... Woodrow Wilson who was running against him was so ah compelled Theodore Roosevelt campaigning on this idea of a new nationalism that he came up with his own program called the new freedom\nIn any event there is nothing wrong with the term nationalism is there but if you look at the dictionary or you just Google ever anything it look it up what are the synonym for nationalism here the first three Senate\nPatriotism patriotic feeling and flag waving okay is there something wrong with that\nI I Am not entirely comfortable with President Trump using the term global as derisive Lee I don't know anyone I honestly do not know anyone who describes himself or herself as a global as\nA and a a ... and ... and that's a word that's problematic that that's but that's not what people are freaking out about\nWhat people are freaking out about this President Trump saying he's a nationalist for instance here is Don Lemon reacting almost in real time just moments after President Trump dropped the N. word Don Lemon on CNN [noise]\nI'm a nationalist\nViews that we're we're going to talk about that word tonight it is a favorite of All right and is loaded with data and racial undertones and global as well global is I've been uses a slur\nSorts sometimes even against those and the administration often with anti Semitic overtone\nWas this happened to make president come right out and embrace nationalism\nOkay what is the problem with nationalism\nA a nationalist or nationalism a this is a again common definition a person who advocates Political Independence for a country patriotic feeling principles are efforts an extreme form of this especially marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries\nAnd then a patriot her patriotism that's listed as a prisoner vigorously supports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies are detractors vigorous support for one's country in other words that's why patriot patriotism is listed as a synonym for nationalism\nAnd um do I think this is may be part of a political strategy for him to\nHelp a push the Republicans over the line and hold the house of representatives in some of these furious house races\nI kind of think Trump just set it but maybe it is maybe it is and I'll tell you why because for ordinary Americans I I mean basically the people who live in this country and yes that includes those are all important suburban women you hear that the president\nSaid I'm a nationalist what is so terrible about that\nAnd ah the chrysalis are right on his face Trump seemed to be simply saying that well past presidents and politicians cared a lot about other countries and what other countries thought about the United states that he cares primarily about us and what is good for us the problem of course is that words matter\nAnd the American president referring to himself as a nationalist has all sorts of problems wrapped up in it\nLet's start with what nationalism means\nHere's a definition as he found this as quote a sense of national consciousness exalted one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on the promotion of its culture and interest as opposed to those of other nations or super national groups\nProblem there\nAnd we do not elect a president of the United states to be a citizen of the world or a public servant for the world we do not we elect a president to represent the United states\nAnd to defend our country and to defend our constitution and yes to defend our culture and there is such a thing as American culture now the term white nationalist\nOr if I dare say so the term black nationalist which is also join the that's the problem let me tell you why it's a problem because what that suggests is that your real nation is something other than the United states\nThe United states obviously has nationalist about America patriots who serve our country who fight for our country who worked for our country of every racial religious and or ethnic background\nIt it it does and the idea that there is something racist about saying I Am a nationalist America specifically and from the beginning has always been a nation\nThat has not to find our nationalism or our nationality based upon race or blood or where you were born\nI mean going all the way back to before the revolution the idea was you could become an American by choice by picking yourself up and moving here and embracing the American idea\nAnd we've always had that we've always had that\nAnd you know we we've talked on this show many times and and it is true it is documented nobody argues against is close to ten percent and maybe over ten percent of the continental army that fought with George Washington for our liberty\nWhere people of color they were black people mostly former slaves because that's why they were here\nAnd the idea of this but the French there actually recorded descriptions of when the French arrived to work with the Americans at Yorktown one of the reasons they look down on the American army was not only not speak the uniforms and the French were about\nNothing if not spit uniforms but because there were so many people of different complex and in that arming one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise] you have a problem with nationalism [noise] does that mean you have a problem with America\nNo and we have to come together and fight it\nAnd that's why this rhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism and seems to me\nI don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a nationalist and let me explain to you there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named ...\nAnd it's it's worth considering because one of the points he makes is that nationalism goes pretty directly\nWith the idea of democracy because if you're talking about a nation state is your real crime\nThen the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America is what patriotism means is that I find myself as an American\nAnd going back to Theodore Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was if you are an immigrant you drop the idea of carrying the flag of your former country you carry the American flag and your nationalism your tribal affiliations what you care about what were you and give your heart to is our nation\nNot a race not an ethnicity\nAnd the fact that that there are so many people out there and the commentary and and so many Democrats who don't get that who are offended by the term nationalism\nI honestly don't think that's helping the Democratic side\nI think if anything it helps on the conservative and Republican side by the way if you're one of those people just offended by the word nationalism\nGive me a call and tell me why one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six uh Michael in San Diego you're on the Michael Mann that show\nYou know I I'm a I feel that uh America is neither a a a country founded on nationalism nor international is a more global is\nHow can you say that we weren't hounded on nationalism\nA we were founded on individual is on nationalism\nOr no no I'm Sorry we weren't we were founded by a lot of people who came together to a risk\nTheir lives and in many cases to give their lives at twenty five thousand people die in the revolution give their lives for the cause of the ... a nation not a not a school board a nation stay with me if I Want to let you answer bag I Will continue what's wrong with nationalism\nHonestly I think it's a beautiful thing and needed in this country and\nProbably around the world tell you why coming up and I'm quoting here insane\nCatastrophic chaos so Michael mad vigil some more polite

America was based on individual as ... not nationalism go ahead\nYeah I um I Would say that America was founded on each individual's right to their his own life his own liberty and the pursuit of his own happiness which were were evolutionary concept [noise]\nAh apple pie ... do you know what the next sentences and the declaration\nAre life liberty and happiness and ... and who and few secure these rights secure these rights governments are instituted among men among men yeah Iraq\nIn other words so the idea of government that's what they were doing they were setting up a government to secure these rights but doing it as and the last words the declaration is and so we pledge to one another our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor\nIn other words the the whole idea of creating a new nation not it involves nationalism because the recognition that Jefferson had and all of the founders had\nIs that without a nation without a government without some kind of social structure anarchy simply doesn't work and there are no rights\nUnless a government exist to protect them so this is one of those things I understand people have gotten a very very bad taste from government meddling in big government and certainly\nIn the twentieth century there were monstrous examples of a governmental tyranny particularly in the communist world and the Nazi world elsewhere\nTo Steve in

and the journal and the whole you know on hold on the point about this is can we recognize that American nationalism from the beginning of the country\nHas been different because it has not been based on race in other words the ... and ... in German nationalism a\nSuch as it is it all very complicated there's a a a a a a tweet that came out uh basically defending Hitler in order to condemn Trump that we have to get to in a moment\nBut ah at Hitler wasn't even German he was Austrian and that's why his nationalism that he talked about was all racial and based on race but\nWell it's interesting you mentioned the French because that's the route British nationalism is the root of chauvinists I'm which obviously as negative implications\nWell know showman is um is is different because of that is is a who is associated with it it's considered an extreme form of nationalism now if you take an extreme form of nationalism\nAh where are you you were insisting on an ... urine nation must rule the whole world problematic but one of the points that the people who've written about this make an in defense of nationalism in in defense of identity\nIs that if you don't have a nation defining who you are\nAnd do you define who you are based upon race or ethnic background\nOr something other than a a national inheritance or a national\nCause it's far more dangerous and far more toxic\nAnd or in terms of of ...

you mentioned that the term but the Nazi Party not see as you know it was an acronym for a national socialist party and uh\nWhat's interesting is that some of the same people who say that a nationalism is a bad word\nOr then take a look at a socialism and oh that's fine that's also now I'm very fashionable word that people are supposed to be embracing look part of the nationalism and he

are I don't wait sending your ballot get it done that way you make sure you're making a contribution\nTo this important national decision the consensus seems to be on the part of everybody who's looking at this John Fund\nThat the momentum seemed to turn around in a Republican direction after the Kavanaugh hearings you agree with that\nWell I think a lot of people have baked and the cake any negative attitudes they had the President Trump\nAnd I think that Trump's antics as a personality had depressed part of the Republican base but the Kavanaugh hearings brought out the ugly Minnesota left their complete disregard for normal procedures and rules and the rule of law and I think that\nAt best that showed the Democrats to be the equal of Trump in a violating norms and politics and it word\nAlmost extra constitutional so I think that Trump managed to succeed where nobody else ever thought he would he managed to get the Democrats to drop their own to rock Tobar surprise on their feet never blow up in their face\nYeah it's it does it does seem like that and I know there are a bunch of people like Dean Heller a who is long considered our most endangered a center of the center for Nevada\nHe strongly supported Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and that appears to have given him a boost I think they're running time now right now in Nevada are they\nI think of the election were held today Republicans would lose none of their seats and the only question is what the Democrats lose two three or four years\nWow which means they of course Republican control of the Senate what about on the house side\n[noise] I Would say the Democrats because of a variety of good factories including the fact that uh\nYou know suburban women become one of the most resistant groups against Trump twenty five point gender gap against them\nOr against Republicans I think there is sixty percent chance to take back the house with sixty percent of the lot lower than it was two or three weeks ago because I think that\nAs the issues start to be talked about you know remember most of your listeners are into politics Michael you and I are into politics the average voter doesn't pay attention to much closer to the election so when they actually look at the issues to the center right country and\nIf the Republicans frame the issues property they'd come to close the gap in the last two weeks unless there's some extraneous about like the two thousand the financial meltdown\nOkay two two issues which are very much front and center at this moment uh one is the alleged had horrible gas that President Trump made last night and used and when he called himself a nationalist do you think this is going to alienate millions and millions of American voters\n[noise] I think it needed to hundreds and hundreds of reporters and journalists were once again appalled by the fact that the president is you know troll ... telling them I mean a notice when he said he said I don't I'm not supposed to say it but I'll say that anyway\nI mean look the president may not be the most elegant speaker but boy does he know how to use language as a weapon up but he doesn't use whatever ears as a trigger word from one of them like he he pulls the trigger\nRight and a pulls the trigger on on then to watch their heads explode and\nI it's just extraordinary I'd like to hear people I even offered to

Seventeen Seventy six our phone number go ahead\nIt has some bad historical antecedent but basically it's another sending them and I think you've pointed this out for patriotism yeah of course a\nAnd again the first three Senate ... that are listed when you just click on it on the Internet are national stealing a national uh as patriotic feeling pardon me patriotism and flag waving\nAnd uh nothing wrong with any of those three things what about we we had on yesterday and I Eric eggers who\nIs a very concerned about uh the confusion in American voting registration suggesting that as many as twenty four percent\nUh of registered voters right now are really shouldn't be voting how you've written about this um extensively do you think that's a very big problem two weeks in the day\nIt depends on the state or you know I I hate to draw national brushing twenty four percent sure some high to me\nI think that the problem with voter fraud as it doesn't show up until the very end with an election was closed and somebody gets desperate and they put their thumb on the scale and send the street money out and it all happens quickly at the very end you know under the cover of a\n... you know vans and everything else so we may not know what happens\nBut we do know that we need to watch for it and if there's anything on toward these bad with these lists like in Georgia you know these ... these are not people are being prevented from voting it just means they have to show up at the polls and fill out a provisional ballot ... and ... and prevent their id\nIt doesn't we're not preventing anyone from voting we're just making sure the person who's voting is the person they say they are\nYeah I mean while I'm there is a um a this additional ... I mean there's thirty six governorships that are up in in this election right now right\n[noise] yeah it's a big this is the big casino yeah and these these these governorships will help decide a redistricting is done after the next census which one to two years\nRight which will also help to determine whoever wins what will be a very close election you don't think there's any chance the Democrats win more than thirty seats are you\nThere oh no no no in fact I think I think the governorships they're going to be a lot of swaps the ... Democrats will take back some Midwestern states that have been in Republican control for a long time like Illinois\nAnd the Republicans are going to take back I think there they'll pick back states where the Democrats mismanaged the finances so bad that ah you know they've given up any chance of governing like Connecticut by the way even Oregon even Oregon\nMake elect a Republican governor for the first time in Thirty years\nRight which would be amazing Boyd is Kate Brown ever deserve to be voted out of power in Oregon now there's one surprise to look for\nIs there a Republican candidate against Angus King in Maine\nThere is but ah and he's a good guy but unfortunately Angus King has this impenetrable independent damage because he technically runs as an independent so he's got that nail down\nOkay except I understood the New York times today random forming piece about the Democrat there is a democratic nominee against Angus King whose name is Zak Ringelstein and he apparently is a big Bernie Sanders guy he's been endorsed by democratic socialist\nIf we could encourage if anybody listening to us up in Maine vote your conscience vote for the real socialist votes or ringelstein

kid that was okay as long as you're addressing other character it feels like something that's offensive to them then you should say it and that's fair to begin to dress up able to take yeah\nOkay that was the extent of what you said by the way I think she's wrong to say when I was a kid it was okay I don't know where she Megan's not that old and a black face hasn't been okay for a long time\nI really and people know that it was a stupid thing to say especially given her history and this is unfortunately what happens with this kind of thing this brings up she said in two thousand and Thirteen\nShe addressed her Fox prime time viewers\nUm about a an argument whether or not there should be black Santas are sent there should be white or black or Latino or Asian\nAnd she said for you kids watching at home sense of justice white just because it makes you feel uncomfortable doesn't mean it has to change you know I mean Jesus was a white man to\nThis is not a good thing to say especially given the fact that um\nI I really do not believe that a Jesus had a racial identity that he spoke about or was aware of he had an identity as a Jewish person but uh as people anyone goes to never Israel will see\nA Jewish people come in all different color coding\nUh okay so ...\nMegan Kelly dons this ah gets into this conference this morning she was already apologized\nUm one uh\nOne source at NBC says many seasoned journalists felt main Kelly's comments or an insult to the profession okay what happened as she is already apologized and do we have the text the apology\nSomewhere here I'm In any event she regrets it deeply and I think we can go on from that particular harm to um to more controversy\nAnd uh and and there's this um\nThere's a great deal of controversy about Stacey Abrams who is a candidate for governor changed the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia and she's running as Brian Kemp who is the Republicans the states ... states Stacey Abrams is state senator\nAnd a ...\nHere's the problem is a two fold problem one of the items that seems to me is more of a problem than the other and ah\nThe one that's getting all the attention today is a CNN is reporting democratic candidate to be George next governor explained her presence Tuesday at a Nineteen Ninety to protest that included burning the state flag\nShe said that was part of her opposition to Confederate symbolism\nHer ah involving came to light on social media and the statement to CNN Abrams campaign said that the actions in college were part of a permitted peaceful protest against the Confederate emblem in the flag is part of Georgia State flag\nAt the time of the protest in Nineteen Ninety to the states ... states flag contain the Confederate battle flag emblem which had been a prominent feature state flag since it was adopted Nineteen fifty six when the battle over to the segregation was raging in the south\nThe Confederate battle flag emblem wasn't fully recover removed from the states flag until two thousand three\nAnd then as I said listen the uh\nStacey Abrams campaign says during Stacey Abrams college years Georgia was at a crossroads struggling with how to overcome racially divisive issues including symbols of the confederacy the sharpest of which was the inclusion of the Confederate emblem and the Georgia State flag\nThen it uh goes on to say a crunch time in public services deputy city attorney in a state legislative leader of all been focused on bringing people together to solve problems\nOr educate the fact that back in Nineteen Ninety two she participated in a demonstration against the state flag\nThat's not a problem it seems to me and shouldn't be a big problem in our campaign it's a long time ago and the flag was changed anyway she's not burning contemporary Georgia flag I'll tell you what is a problem\nShe has gone on record\nAnd she is standing by in about basically blowing up the largest Confederate monument to the mall and this is one then I have spoken about this before this whole issue of Confederate monuments\nI I can understand why you would decide not to blow anything up but to move a statue for instance the best example is in New Orleans\nThey had a statue of Robert he lay on top of a killer and it really looked over the whole city and it was sort of like the Nelson's statue on top of a pillar infer fog or square in Great Britain in London\nAnd having Robert de Leon such a prominent place looking over the whole city I get it problem\nDon't blow it up but they and I don't know what they're putting on top of that pillar of anything maybe that's a volt pillar down they moved all these statue okay\nBut when you're talking about Stone Mountain I actually looked it up the Stone Mountain memorials bigger than Mount Rushmore as carved into the side of a mountain and it took about Thirty years to do all the carving it was a very very big undertaking\nAnd inner side of the mountain is an image of Jefferson Davis president of the confederacy Robert ... commander of the army of northern Virginia and his chief lieutenant of Thomas Jonathan Jackson Stonewall Jackson and they're all riding along\nAnd Stacey Abrams is taken the position of that monument has to be removed and fresh and honestly I don't understand it\nThere are lots of African Americans in the state of Georgia Stone Mountain by the way it's over three thousand acres of beautiful beautiful park\nAnd it is owned I'm pretty sure by the city of Atlanta has three thousand acres and their trails they used to have a whole neo Confederate theme park is the New York times points out where they had a plantation house that's all gone if they put up appropriate signage that looks at the side of this mountain\nAs a historical symbol wouldn't that be a better way to go than simply say an blasting it or ruining it are knocking it down and because of the size of Stone Mountain\nYou wouldn't mind with the Taliban remember them they blew up these Buddhas because they took over the Buddhist wherever twelve hundred years old and they blew them up in the ... valley\nAnd uh basically that was a that was before September eleventh\nAnd I went on the air and I talked about it and I said this is an act of terrorism\nAgainst the past and\nLook I understand that you can move a statue but the notion that you have to blow up a whole mountainside\nIt's it's a little bit nutty in the the New York times they point out that the\nDavid Huckabee who is a Georgia syndicated columnist no relation to the White House press secretary\nAssailed misery roast position\nRating that she intends to run the most racist than divisive campaign and the history of Georgia politics removing such symbols won't keep one black father at home with his family\nDidn't want to take a single illegal weapon off of a single street in a single black neighborhood\nAnd a ... look I understand that the whole history behind the Stone Mountain monument\nIs a a a it is a terrible thing because they started putting it up started plans for Nineteen fourteen and it was associated with the rise of the clan all of which of course was presided over with great approval by a southerner Democratic president\nWoodrow Wilson and yes Woodrow Wilson was ... Virginia\nI Know he was governor of New Jersey before\nBut uh the idea that you have to blow up that memorial ... why would Democrats want to be the real Taliban of American politics I don't get it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number we'll be right", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "23"}
