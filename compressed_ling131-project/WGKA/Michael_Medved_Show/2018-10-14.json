prohibition alcohol abuse became rampant and the country almost rank itself off the rails was the same thing happened with marijuana\nNow by the way this is really important because it's historically true most people think oh you know prohibition was a gigantic failure people drank just as much under prohibition\nAnd then they ended prohibition everything was happy this by the way it was a big Republican democratic issue was one of the first things of Franklin Roosevelt did when the Democrats came to power\nOr was end the prohibition amendments to uh go ahead and repeal the prohibition of

indignant about this it's just that we've had bias in\nThe media for a long long time but sometimes it's particularly egregious and I'll give you an example I um had watched the news coverage early this morning about the ceremony last night which I had not seen a lot and the ceremony last night was in the White House\nWith a President Trump\nWelcoming the whole Kavanaugh family the two daughters who are so proud of their dad and his wife Ashley that's a judge Kavanaugh his wife Ashley and Justice Kennedy was there and ... all the judges justices of the Supreme Court were there\nAnd\nWhat I heard about this event was oh it's too bad it was supposed to be such a nicer than but Trump ruined dead as he often does because what he said was so outrageous and he was so off the rails and he ruined this event never before any spoil that and it's disgusting and horrible\nAs you know what when you watch it that is simply not true\nAnd let me tell you one area where I honestly I think most of the coverage\nThat I saw on NBC and very much on CNN which is deliberately misleading they made it sound\nAs if a\nKavanaugh spoke and spoke with dignity and then Trump spoke afterward and then ruined everything that justice\nIt wasn't like that because President Trump spoke first and he welcome people introduced everybody they all walked in together\nAnd then the president said thank you very much thank you members of Congress members of the cabinet honored gas and fellow Americans are my privilege to address you tonight from the East Room of the White House\nAnd then after a

our founders and it is up to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection that linked us all to gather as one great American family [noise]\n\nAnything wrong with that it it doesn't seem to me that there is it seems to me that President Trump was in the right spirit for the occasion as he was with these last comments introducing the actual swearing in less than\nJust as kind of fills the

justice has ever sworn in a former work to take his seat\nA beautiful moment which reminds us that freedom is a tradition passed down from generation to generation and that's a big statement and I want to thank you for that so much so [noise]\nIt is beautiful or if if there's someone who really believes that this was a disgrace somehow that that President Trump ruined this occasion you can give us a call and tell us why\n'cause I don't see it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and judge Kavanaugh spoke particularly beautifully\nAnd yes I I think that some of his inter changes with the senators at his hearing were more testy than they need to debate\nAnd yes he didn't answer all the questions about his high school yearbook perhaps perfectly\nBut you know what in the sweep of history I think President Trump is right the entire process year as manipulated by the likes of Dianne Feinstein and an ash two and a and Spartacus and Mazie Hirono and a Richard Blumenthal and Sheldon Whitehouse\nAnd the rest of them and that entire process will be remembered as a sham and a disgrace and not a positive thing for the country so this is a good place to turn forward and move ahead\nWhen we come back we'll we'll go to your calls one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and we'll also\nPlay a\nMost of a judge Kavanaugh's justice Kavanaugh's brief but I think very moving and very well crafted remarks or we will be right back on the dawn of a new day and a new term for the Supreme Court of the United states coming up on them that that show [noise]\nReally is it is that there do you think\nWhen President Trump concluding his remarks said I'm is up to us to read that gay or sales to the traditions and wisdom of our founders and a desire to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection that Lincoln altogether as one great American family\nOkay he acknowledged that it was unusual what he was doing\nBut I Do think that the process that victimized both Dr blessing for an end justice Kavanaugh that's a process was unusual and not admirable\nLou and Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the Michael Mann that show\n[noise] sure\nHi Hi you're on\nBut yeah um I mean I I don't you know when I look at what what he did he said he was completely um you know proven to be innocent\nUm he didn't he didn't investigate all the people who work at actual witnesses that we're likely witnesses that would have more information it was not a thorough process so for him to go around and do that slap it in our face okay the the law they voted in two thousand twelve for Obama didn't get Merrick Garland\nAny slap it in our face and say it's proven innocent they didn't even have a really the only investigation\nThat way when you say when you said phony investigation what do you mean who who are the witnesses or that\nThere were several there were several witnesses that the Ramirez woman\nI I understand they decide they made a decision they made it up\nBecause that was not their job what they were asked to do was to investigate Dr Ford and as far as Deborah Ramirez is concerned I mean come on\nCome on it's it's the idea but in other words what they didn't do the FBI and I think there are right now to do it was go through a whole investigation of I'm Brett Kavanaugh's drinking habits when he was a freshman at Yale\nOr when he was a senior in high school why because it was irrelevant the question was if if Deborah Ramirez has some magic witness that you could could uh from the fact\nWhich she even said by the way Deborah marriage she said I was too drunk to really remember this is what she thought happened and it's a recovered memory and it was after the fact\nAnd this is panic what relevance does it have to his qualifications to be on the Supreme Court low\nSo my feeling is you were treated ten times better than Obama but and then Merrick Garland was\nOkay I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I guarantee you that Merrick Garland would prefer what happened with him which was great respect no one spoke harshly about him no one smearing him no one came up with things about his\nHigh school days or college days and

Washington\nAnd justice Douglas or for thirty six years on the Supreme Court he wrote some of the most important legal decisions some of which are kind of nutty but they're very important\nAnd justice Douglas had so many ethical problems and just named one of them he actually because he had so many alimony payments he had three ex wives\nAnd he had to write little articles to help meet the expenses because he wasn't generating enough money and he wrote articles for a guy who has to be a pornographer who had a case before the courts\nAnd he later than pay the money back but he was caught with that\nAnd and then he also wrote articles that had appeared in like a magazine that were some justices thought were pornography he didn't\nAnd just that plus the fact that he got involved with a Twenty one year old would have been assigned to do a term paper and her college about justice Douglas he was married at the time he got involved with her it could be construed as sexual harassment and today's terms it didn't ruin his judgeship\nA and by the way there were attempts to impeach him and they were foolish and I opposed those attempts\nOr they were led by Gerald Ford who later became president of the United states\nAs a point over here is that when people say oh because he said I'm some in temperate things when he was giving testimony he can ever be taken seriously as a judge Clarence Thomas has had a fine career on the court\nHe's made some by the way brilliant an amazing speeches since being confirmed on the court\nAnd uh I don't think he has been ruined by the charges against him or let them ruined him at all David I appreciate your call very much um we have a time to go to the audio Jeremy for from Cairo okay we are coming up\nWell we're coming up to um somebody who is way beyond criticism the rock well maybe not so beyond criticism and this particular movie member rock was one to go to the world's tallest buildings and\nRescue people flying through the air [noise] well the movie's called skyscraper worth checking out on DVD and video on demand will tell you in this ...

us in just a few minutes\nBut up first we take a look at the fate of one of the most liberal minded members of Congress as he faces a very tough reelection fight\nMy guess at this time is Virginia Republican congressman Dave Brat represents the Old Dominion seventh congressional districts and he is in a tough reelection battle against Democrat Abigail Spanberger it's one of a number of congressional districts in Virginia Held by a Republican\nBut really targeted by the Democrats and congressman thanks so much for being with us\nHey you bet thank you Greg\nWhile we're got about four weeks left now until this a midterm election and the one poll I've seen off from the New York times has you up for but the margin of error is right around that same spot right now so how do you see the ...\nYeah I think after the cabin on hearing aids or plots say a big upward Bob and I think the American people are piling zooming in their noticing that my opponent can have a platform she's not running on any issues whatsoever so it really is kind of matching\nMirroring the national peace we up policy on health care we win\nOn a ... borders you know liberal immigration policy my opponent for sanctuary cities we win and my opponent said the tax cuts for dangerous since er she's Nancy Pelosi\nOn policy and or the rest is just resistance from the left and I think the American people want to see some results up there and so we got tax\nCuts uh my district is booming the jobs are doing great there's more job openings that people searching and to everybody's saying that right the unemployment rate are at all time low for African Americans in women decades Lowes for Asians skill kids Hispanics\nAnd so we got a good news results driven message and we're happy to take that to the voters\nAbigail Spanberger says that you have been an opponent of making sure people with preexisting conditions have coverage I Know you fought back against that vigorously what's the story that\nI don't understand why it's a story but the news the mainstream media doesn't news anymore I mean if if everybody missed that memo that was the biggest debate of the year and we had the health care vote and we all voted for pre existing conditions\nAnd so that shows you how the Democrats are hurting right that were had they're losing so they'd have to spread total pants on fire false could\nIt everybody knows that was a key feature of our Republican health care plan and I held it up at my town hall with a legislative taxed with preexisting conditions in\nAnd Abigail Spanberger was at the front row and saw it a long time ago so she knows that she did intentionally\nSpreading that's I'm I'm Glad you brought the issue of Democrats that's what they deal with the last month a campaign or when they're losing they say they're Republicans are going to take away Social Security and\nMedicare what do we promised in a while on the record pledging to protect those programs for good on Craig's list integration and then they really get a personal you know they did the personal destruction with cabinets Iraq and so uh\nI I don't think the voters like that they want to see more civil a debate on policy\nCongressman let's talk about your opponent a little bit Abigail Spanberger she has a background and the CIA and also\nA for a time before her tenure at the CIA she was connected to an institution that has raised more than a few eyebrows and the media coverage of campaign raising this issue has not been kind but ah what do you what the voters in your district to know about her affiliations\nAre well she has not told the voters that anything about her record now\nResume and so I think what you might be referring to is her work at the uh the a Saudi funded a terror high school\nAnd she is telling people she worked at the embassy high school and taught Shakespeare et cetera but there's a government report out a ... put out by the Democrat Schumer into Israel to shut down the school because there was anti Semitic anti Christian anti women\nOr insulin hey that shouldn't kill people from other states et cetera I disagree with you until they that's\nWhat this come into question the Washington Post an essay on that school before she got the job\nShe went to work for the CIA after that after teaching there\nBut the question is that she she went to the New York times and said I'm proud of teaching at that school at that school produced terrorists and someone that wanted to kill a president et cetera\nAnd there's a U.S government report saying that it's not an embassy school and so I think that's what you're talking about with that story and then no one in the news media has yet reported on it on the facts of this story\nIn late they kind of hidden behind the process question but they don't get to the meat and potatoes and the easiest way to show that the contrast is can you imagine if a Republican taught at a school that was anti Semitic\nAnti Christian anti women [laughter] and uh you know Saudi hobby fundamentalists school I it it it made it front page of the New York times for weeks\n[laughter] I Know we've only got about Ninety seconds left a congressman or just this week to current house majority leader Kevin McCarthy unveiling border security build the wall\nOr legislation I Know immigration was a key issue when you initially getting elected to Congress I Know it's still an issue you're passionate about such a quick question that our last minute here what do you think of the bill and why is he rolling it out now instead of sometime in the past two years\nWell yeah I'm I'm all in favor of it and I I Hope it's a strong bail I'd been put a good laugh though which includes that cost other features and so it shares all good news and you know we've had you know some budget to that the president is not happy\nWith the I'm not happy with the trillion dollar deficits than we did not get wall funding so I think that's why it's now a it'll come up after the election now before January so I Hope we keep our libraries there because it's Seventy or eighty percent issue for the people right no one wants to cheap labor\nPeace or we have three hundred million the lethal doses of science now come across the border last year or through our open borders right in the the democratic ... for sanctuary cities Nancy Pelosi's first day of protest do sanctuary cities\nThat actually provided sanctuary for the drug dealers who commit crimes and I don't know the American people fully understand that but that that's what's at stake and so um it's overdue I'm happy they're bringing it up\nWhen we got her on thank you very much for your time today thank you Greg anytime they give you better Virginia Republican
