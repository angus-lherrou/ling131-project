snapped in my ass and it often will are worried about removing all the surface fat in my food prep recommendations\nMany drillers smokers recommend leaving a cap of fat on brisket or roast such as the rump roasted in the belief that the fat actually penetrate the meet muscle fiber\nWhen it's cooking now even meet guys at grocery stores will very sincerely tell you this when you're buying a piece of meat in their store\nBut it's been proven by meet scientists that fat\nCan penetrate meet muscle\nSo by leaving a fad cap on big meets your just leaving an insulating blanket on one side of the meat that just increases your cooking time\nIt prevents the creation of tasty bark on the meat surface and it also will make a big mess and your grill or you're smoker if you're not using a trip pan underneath that none of these are reasons to leave a fat cap on your big mates\nSo my recommendation is you remove all of the fat including the fact cap\nAnd season up that surface\nTo make more flavorful bark on your roast it's also going to make much better sandwiches we ever had my sliced roast beef sandwiches guess\nI have higher man and they're delicious and they want to add all your

about transforming refund them around and do a flavor fiesta\nHow to take that cheap beef sales and marketing and make magic with it on your barbeque grill so we've crept in slow smoked at bottom around ... probably the most tender cut\nOn a very tough section of the car we smoked it up to the initial target temple one ten to one Fifteen\nWe're roasting this medium rare beef or sandwiches after\nThe initial hot meal so the first thing we want to do now when we're thinking about transitioning from the slowest thing process to finishing checked the temp with an instant read meat probe up so you don't have a good one you need to get one of those right away our first target temp\nIs one way to one Fifteen\nAnd at that temperature we're going to remove it we're going to ... take out the drip pan the heat shield the support brace that's if you're using are set up short on meat masters radio dot com if you're using the standard side by side to zone set up just get those colds going real hot over and the other side\nSo you can do that by elevating the cold up under the cooking grades as best you can and let them heat up for a few minutes now you need to leave the lid up on this and then place the roast\nRight over that heat and brought up the exterior role that roaster out right over the fire use a tool\nA bachelor or some other type of instrument out there and your barbeque grill don't use your hands because it's going to be very hot and you want a role that roaster around exposing all the surface to the fire\nWatch for the color change to a deep brown and constantly be checking your temps with your digital temperature pro\nSo you watch it you roll it you keep moving it to get an even see her all over on all sides of that roast and remove it when the internal temp reaches between one twenty five\nAnd one twenty eight might take about ten minutes or so I'm just guessing it does depend on a hot air fire is why do you take it off at one twenty five to one twenty eight well carry over cooking\nIs going to take this up to one thirty two to one thirty five maybe even a little bit higher you don't want to get a much higher than one thirty five I guarantee or it's going to be tough and it's done at that point one of those things you can do\nIs to spread a patch of butter on top of the roast while upsetting interesting and let it rest for about ten minutes or so\nRemoved the strings that you put on the roast as well before you slice it or you can do it as you slice it but remember you have to slice a roast like this across the grain it has a very important effect on how tender it is to eat so remember to slice it across the grain\nModification stabbing feeding cattle that much of a crime through the Vatican Ken KEN\nAttempt forgetting well done beef or is that people like it well done to try medium rare beef if you haven't heard this before and heard my recommendation\nIt's the sight of that red water colored protein called ... globe and that's responsible for meat color pigment that that that really is what bothers them as the side of it not the taste after all it's the same proteins that runs out of pork or chicken\nWhich doesn't seem to bother them at all because it's just a different color it's usually clear\nIt's deeper reading beef because there's more protein and beef so here's what you do don't slice the roast in front of these people that are going to eat it but somewhere where they can't see what you're doing\nThe bowling bark seasoning that I recommend you put on it and the smoke will turn the red protein dark brown when you slice it so just Basie each slice as you cut it in the carving juices which is going to turn the red interior\nA dark brown that's right you just trickle baby each red slice in the platter juices and watch it changed the color\nThey'll eat it like crazy and they'll ask for more and they'll never know it's medium rare roast beef\nAnd if that doesn't work cut out for well done and from the end of the roast and serve them that one of the two will work but try the bathing the slices in the juices bit first\nMy guess is that they'll tell you they've never tasted roast beef that good before and quite frankly they haven't because they've been cooking all the flavor out of their belief\nIs that we have a lot of people in the ... car\nWhile in summary I suggest you read up on your beef roast cuts get to know them check out the meat cuts link at meat masters radio dot com and dig deeper if you have to\nUnlike pork each kind of beef has a universal identification code number which is assigned to it regardless of the beef cuts name that you see in the grocery store and I believe and I have talked about this before that these these codes are tied usually to treaties that the United states government just ignored\nBut try different cuts and learn the techniques understand that some are better for cooking to medium rare while other cuts are better for low and slow smokes\nBut you do have to cook those low and slow smokes up to two hundred and three degrees no which is which so when you buy a roast you know clearly and exactly what you intend to do with it\nRegardless of which one it is your beef smokes will be juicy\nTender and loaded with big bold beefy flavor so that is my recommendation Mr Potter Rosa and the rest of the listeners\nOn how to take that cheap beef sale you see it the market and it sometimes can be really reduced I mean there are times you confided under two dollars a pound mhm but it's usually always going to be the beef bottom route I Believe I even got a call from you once when you were in the grocery market\nAsking me about a platter of stakes that you were looking at and they were on sale\nAnd I explained to you that was stakes made the beef bottom around so they were not really going to be what you were expecting them to be from a steak mhm but then you did find that believe it was it wasn't that when you discovered the tops our line as one of your most favorite cuts next to the ... well no that\nWasn't when I discovered the tops or on a I found a top zero and that was Christ right and I thought you know what I'm going with\nThis and I think I got like a two and a half told her that for the two and a half pounds state yes yeah I got that big huge hunk of meat and I needed some quantity go into the the cat but now we are as when I was looking at going all the you know I can cook a few of these things and they were\nNice and even ... that would you know they look easy to cook but I didn't I wasn't sure about the cut\nAnd I know I can rely on top sort of line but it was tough not to check in the price was not alarm member\nCorrectly that those were gods stakes cut off the ball to which actually isn't too bad of a cut I mean it is I mean I Would take the ... over the ball up mhm but if all you're looking at is the ball to it is kind of from the same area and the cow as the rump roast is\nAnd our favorite the tri tip in some of these other cuts in that area\nTo the ball to isn't bad it's just I think he made a much better choice to go with the\nTop sort of line and you've kind of stuck with that ever since then I mean\nIt's just the prices always right now I can find like a rib eye or a a Porter house on sale or something like that uh recently I got a strip because it was just cheap they're trying to get rid of them you know do you cook a lot of steaks with the bones in like no matter how rarely rarely house and the I'm not against doing it I just don't do it very often because there's just\nBarrel rooms wind sellers and other magical my\nGun like clockwork every single [noise]\nRape and counters radio\n\nDown there in\nBerlin\nSkinny out the thing that runs out there\nAnd it is time for your weekly ribbon counter I Am your wind captain David Wilson here today show I think has a theme I didn't actually intended to but the theme would be women who writes about wine and there's a brand new one but that has come out we're going to be talking about that\nIt's just a little bit but there is another person who writes about wine and she is an author but what she's written most recently it really almost defies description I'm Talking about Laura contain yeah\nAnd if you're not familiar with the ... name you should be and definitely if you're a mal back drinker you would definitely no the ... name they've been responsible for making\nSome of the best mailbox and other varietals in Argentina for very long time and work became yet is a very interesting character that I wanted to get on the show and I know we'll do it eventually maybe after she hears about this little piece that I'm doing right now she'll be inclined to come and join us behind the microphone\nShe is not always in Argentina she is in San Francisco\nWhere she is an emergency doctor\nAnd a very good one from what I understand\nBut I digress a little bit ... let's talk about the piece of work that she has just written\nShe hasn't just written a piece she also stars in a stage version of the same is so amazing that they have a brand of wine called Kenya's pasta and I have always told people that that continues a pot of wine\nIn my opinion is one of the best greatest spies out there\nYou can get it in the U.S I think for probably under a hundred and fifty dollars a bottle so I Know that yeah that's a lot of money\nTo pay for wind but after you've tasted it you'll go bonkers and you'll understand the price and in my opinion actually\nIt's probably a very low price for the wine considering just how incredibly beautiful it is well they created a new label for ... now back Argentinean two thousand and Fifteen\nAnd it is a humble ... or it depicts the history of mal back\nIn Argentina it's a very complex a piece of artwork which looks like they could go back to Fifteen sixteen hundreds but anyway it's really quite a striking piece it's got four characters on it and those four characters were the inspiration for Laura to along with another member of the family right this for act\nPlay in which she plays all the parts\nAnd it's played in small theaters around the east coast and some other places but from what I understand it will be coming to a wine bar near you were maybe an even bigger place than that\nLet's go back and talk for a second about Laura because she is really considered to be one of the great faces of wine making in Argentina and then we'll talk a little bit about the play after that anyway Laura is a fourth generation Arjun time visiting her she's a physician as I said she's an author\nLaura was born in Mendoza and spent her childhood with her grandfather Domingo at the family's winery in the small village of lousy bird Todd\nAnyway yeah she graduated magna cum laude from a of all places Harvard University back in Nineteen eighty eight and has a medical doctor degree from Stanford University so we aren't talking degrees on line here folks this they very smart well educated person back in Nineteen Ninety five\n... joined her father Nicholas containing as the ... at the family's winery\nAnd they found that the ... Institute of wine with the idea of making urgent time winds that could stand up against the best one of the world and boy do they ever well or has continued to practice all of these years envy the wind director at ... as well\nThey've McIntyre the Washington Post wrote this about Laura ... since ... took over and put her name on the label the state's series seems to have taken on a bigger rats your expression that contain is about to winds can stand proudly among the best in the world\nAnd and I agree you know I get asked the question all the time what's your favorite wine and there's a lot of ones to choose from\nBut he throws that question at me but I still think that one of the grandest most explosive experiences that I ever had was with the ... the ... well All right let's say\nGo on with the show here for a second I mean not my show but with the play well it all began with the label and according to Dr ... uh for the most part uh labels are just marketing tools designed to quickly catch the guy from a store shelf she says but we had a different idea\nWhy not create a label that delve deeper and traumatized as the incredible cultural story behind ... migration from Europe to the America is is funny I tell a story about\nHow much backed out here are or how far back that to Argentina\nFrom the U.S and it's a very different story than is in this play let's just say that I anthropomorphize winds and give them personalities I if I have time I'll tell you that story and a little bit but I I just want to share this one with you because it's\nIt's still amazingly interesting anyway um took them about a year to create the original art work for the the ... back to collectible release which probably makes it even more expensive and valuable\nBut anyway the label artwork also inspired Dr Kenya to create this for act to play with four allegorical females figures\nAnd she did that in conjunction with her brother in law who is play right Gustavo all a ... and and the performance Dr Chaney a\nHerself brings the four figures from the labeled alive the theatrical piece debuted on may seventh to an audience of trade and media and bow and arrow which is in Argentina restaurant in New York's lower east side and then the second performance took place during the Nantucket wine and food festival which I wanted to go to and couldn't get there\nBut anyway yeah there's a lot of other scheduled performances coming up and so you'll just have to Google that and see if you can catch it because I have a feeling it is a wonderful thing to experience anyway uh the I'd give it a label began with Dr contain his sister now she's a historian Adrian nicotine yeah\nI mean this isn't no slouch family are folks there or play writes in the family and his ... and the family in the greatest winemakers in the world and the family and doctors and yeah\nThis is a serious family but anyway the idea came from my age ... and she says the story of wine is almost always been told from a male perspective and we decided that it was time to honor the women who are intrinsic ... traveled from Europe to the American and frankly I don't know that story\nAnd my doctor continues as as we dove into our research we were amazed by the stories they were funny dramatic and sometimes tragic I was inspired to write the play\nAnyway for her performance Dr ... fleshed out the roles of all four of the characters depicted on the label which include Eleanor of Aquitaine the twelve century monarch and ... champion\nThe character Madame ... which was not a real person but a disease that wiped out almost everything in Europe she describes Madame ... as\nThe voracious female aphid that was this gorgeous Bordeaux in the Eighteen fifty's are also in the play the Italian immigrant animals center\nWho wish to change his own great grandmother and represents those who brought the first ... to the Americas and finally Adriana ... who was at the site or a father and Nicholas ... tenure as established the great variety as a treasure of the new world\nThe label by the way just to top honors at the drinks business award\nWhich is a very prestigious awards receiver labels so you've got to check it out anyway I'm not going to tell you any more to spoil the play for you I think what our next step should be is to get a Dr Laura ... no not that Dr Laura [laughter]\nDr Laura could change again here\nAnd let's see if we can get a complete rundown of the story and we'll probably do is tell you my story about\nThe evolution of mail back and you can compare it to hers and you'll see ... well I'm just full of it [laughter] okay All right we're going to move on but it is this something worth looking out for and I'm going to see if I could find a video of this play\nOn stage and maybe I can share that with you as well but I thought it was a fun story and glad to share it here now All right we're going to move on it's just a second here there's a brand spanking new book out it's it's really an entry level\nBook I Would say but it is designed to help people who are finding themselves falling in love with wine to get them the basics that might not be the basics that you're going to find in a typical wind\nClass or in some other kind of wind but it'll be really interesting to talk to the author and see why she wrote what she wrote that's coming up next it is the wind lovers apprentice coming up next on grape encounters\nThere's probably a good chance you can get the winds on line and you should because they're going to be less expensive anyway\nRight now it late is always a way to kind of get wine and you know shipping kind of really varies from state to state and even what store what person you talk to it's really quite variable where do you live kind of you know near a border and have one what can I just\nWant to eat and then you know I'll come pick it up renting how my theory or something or get out the active in your community and kind of the people you're wine store or at your restaurant and the you know I I had this and I really liked it can you get there for me what can you get something along these lines for me and and kind of you know push people a little bit\nThe sad part about that story is this the the reason that a lot of really top quality winds don't make it to certain locales is because they don't have the marketing dollars behind that they don't have the big operation behind that\nAnd so a company and I'm not saying this in any way shape or form to be negative towards companies like let's say Kendall Jackson or mondavi they make just fine wines but they're big companies they've got power\nAnd they've got the power to get their wines into places where\nA small boutique winery would not be able to do that very same thing so it does limit the choices\nThat a person might have but let's assume for the rest of this interview but most people can get their hands on some good
