yeah\nThank you um anyway boys with ... you know they do is grabbing that um or whatever I didn't care boys will be boys anyway a few years ago on fifty three now but a few years ago I was a manager in charge of hiring\nFor everybody yes we're going to be talking a little bit about this a new attack on President Trump will get a response\nOn that the new attack which is really an old attack\nAbout President Trump ... dodging taxes any isn't really a self made billionaire and there is it feels like about a two thousand page report seems to be very well researched in the New York times so what is the relevance of this right now\nIt's obviously an attempt to tilt the election in the direction of Democrats will be speaking with Stephen Moore a advisor to President Trump and the Trump campaign about that and about the progress on trade\nWhere there's been great progress in the markets love it we've had this week uh the markets have just been on fire sky rocketing\nUm why is that happening we'll talk with us even more about that will also be speaking with Juan Williams on Fox News\nHis new book about President Trump and the black community it's not a positive book toward President Trump\nBut the question for Juan Williams will be what about the evidence and there's lots of it that there is at least in increasing open mindedness to the Republican message from African Americans we will get to that as well on the med bed show but first\nI just wanted to give you a little bit of perspective as as people probably recognize I was off for the first two days of this week because the conclusion of our Jewish holiday season\nAnd actually I Want to thank Mark Davis for again doing such an outstanding job and are\nHelping to carry the ball on this show while we were completing what is a a basically it's almost a month long of one holiday after another and they're all important holidays and they're all meaningful\nThis one was particularly meaningful to me not just because our daughter was here from New York um and and not just because there was a great time to get together with family and and big extended family and began ... but also because on this whole Kavanaugh matter\nI I was able to see a little bit of perspective and let me just tell you something that happened which I don't think I Will ever forget I mean normally I go to services I go to synagogue and a A N normally I talked to my friends\nI was approached by a little kid and when I say a little kid Mm ten eleven years old\nAnd um\n[noise] it ... ... he asked me I I'm not even sure who he was\n... you know as with the car engine a hundred people there and anyway so the kid comes up to me\nAnd he says I I heard somebody say here that that Brett Kavanaugh through ice and somebody a Thirty Years' ago white lines that a big deal and I had\nNot yet seen the story about the alleged a bar fight and one thirty in the morning when Brett Kavanaugh was a sophomore I Believe at Yale and then I later in the horrors\nOf ice throwing and somehow it this is now reaching kids in America I mean under age kids this is where our politics is\nA is that just think about think about it think about it I mean not that it's okay to throw wise\nOr not that it's okay to be under age in a bar find them cetera et cetera no one uh was damaged\nOr charged or arrested in this a bar or they were arrested they weren't charge\n'em okay this whole idea where our politics is right now I really do believe those political consultants and girls and campaign people who are saying that right now the Kavanaugh thing as powerfully helping Republicans\nAnd I believe for one very simple reason if you like everything we've gone through with Kevin on four in the back in the forest and the punching in the pushing the nastiness\nAnd then you're going to vote for Democrats because I'm a Kavanaugh was not arrested okay let let me make that clear there was a police report about breaking up a bar fight and there was an allegation that he threw ice and uh\nAgain I think it's more relevant to the Democrats want to throw ice out they want to throw out ice they want to get rid of the immigration and Customs Enforcement I mean it was anything is more relevant\nThan the idea that Brett Kavanaugh money was at Yale I'm I was a member of a hard drinking fraternity\n... the whole idea that this is significant and that is worthy of our attention this is where our politics is right now if you want more of the politics of personal destruction if you want more\nOf let's go over every single detail of people's passed to try to smear them and destroying them if you want more of this feeling of constant combat\nThen sure you want the Democrats to take over the house because that's what you'll get you'll get impeachment you'll get in fact a Gerald nab blur the radical from Manhattan and he is he's one of the most left wing members of Congress\nWould become the new chairman of the house Judiciary Committee and he's already talked about impeaching justice Kavanaugh\nAfter he is confirmed if you think that's where politics should go and then first of all tell me why secondly you are almost sure to vote Democrat anyway if you do want to change if you are in politics\nThat is a little bit more civil a little bit more respectful a little bit more about results\nRather than just destroying the enemy and results for the American people more days where the stock market is is up more days where people are working where people get raises\nI mean across the board it's happening now\nAnd ah\nAnd meanwhile what what's the focus of the focus is on on\nPresident Trump not mocking\nBut daring to question a Christine Blasey Ford and he did it at a rally last night and President Trump is on button and rallies and they'll just wasn't on his speech but first of all people say well he ... he didn't imitate her he referred accurately to some of her testimony\nHere was the president of the United states and what he had to say\nI have one right I Am wondering\nWell is it goes you know it was one of them are good how did you get home I don't remember how did you get or don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nI'm zone where was I don't know but I Wonder if that's the only thing\n[noise]\nAdvises fatter amass lives shattered\nOkay I'm look at ... is it somehow out of bounds probably it would be better if the president do it didn't do it but is it appropriate to question her testimony or you can only question judge Kavanaugh\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number the I'm Sarah Sanders was asked about that today by John Roberts on Fox this is the White House press briefing about President Trump's comments about Christine Blasey Ford and here is the presidential press secretary Sarah Sanders\nWhy does the president said what do we reduce the\nPresident was stating the facts are frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel missiles were poor he was fading facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts a\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked up for every single word second my second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations\nThat have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous this entire process has been in disgrace and the only reason that it's been that way is because Senate Democrat\nDidn't do this the way that it should have been done and they circumvented the entire system and frankly they've undermining our entire judicial branch by the way that they've acted in inappropriate Nestle which they conducted themselves was\nOkay I I Believe is with that in mind that\nCertainly the Republican base\nPeople who voted and put President Trump in the White House that bases getting engaged and that's a good thing there's other reasons for having to do with the economy will speak with us Stephen Moore a coming up about the future of the economy and its political\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... ... I Believe in March thirteenth ... thousand yeah uh it was I read a lot of it I didn't make it through the whole thing\nI had a couple impressions I made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up on the first point I made was wait a minute this was like you know turning on the TV and seeing you know that with a hundred times you know friends episode re rod you know that you've already seen twenty times\nHow many times with the New York times run the story I I really I worked on the campaign they much one three or four stories about Trump cheating on his taxes\nAnd you know then they ran one last year and now the running this one and there's not much different in this story than the one they've run multiple times so it's just like you know just by an old copy the newspaper because I've been to this movie before the second point I made us look they're alleging kept fraud tax there is a difference a\nMichael between tax avoidance which any good businessman them any good you know head of household will do you want to minimize the taxes you pay right I mean I don't know about you Michael I tried to pay the least amount of actually I Do not the most him out\nTheir backs avoiding and tax evasion and they are they are accusing Trump of tax fraud when a lot of these like I'm not an expert on tax policy but it looks like a lot of these things were just legal ways of of minimizing your tax burden and is there any American in the last fifty years has been\nIt by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't he release his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about or his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason they're campaigning for Democrats the Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYeah once again you're all one hundred percent correct that's exactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN a crust Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Trump\nA release of tax reforms I advise tromp among many other people during the campaign do not do not really sure ... because if you think this report which was Thirteen they they did Thirteen thousand words they don't even have\nYou know a lot of the tax documents this the man who has you know warehouses full of ... jak document through all the businesses he's running through\nThe ... and all but I mean I I just think it would be a Pandora's box okay uh\nAnd don't file your taxes in a

skin color in terms of his educational opportunities employment opportunities where he can live where you can buy a house where you can rent an apartment all of this dictated by skin color and then you come to me I'm sixty four is born Nineteen fifty for Michael\nAnd uh it's just an incredibly different world live I live in a world where Jeff what you know I've seen not only the first black secretary of state the first black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff I've seen the first black\nBillionaire you know people like Oprah Winfrey Bob Johnson\nOr I can go on a record number of blacks and Congress black mayors this we are black senators it's a you know I I joke in there that you know my dad if he was aware of my daughter and I said dad and my daughter has a Georgetown Law degree\nHe played with Georgetown Law doesn't except by people well that was true to the sixties but she does today and of course I could say hey bad you know look at me here I Am having lunch at the White House and he's ... who's the other black guy and I said oh that's the president that Rocco bomb if you don't live in a different world you live in a different universe\nAdvil there has been for his men this progress made in this country\nPresident Trump has invited to the White House no\nOkay would you go if he did no\nSee I don't get that I just an end to the same thing with with some of the\nUm in other words it like you I I Want President Trump I Want Republicans generally to uh be a more broad based party not just to be the party of older white guys a lot to be a party that reaches out to everybody because otherwise we have no future\nAnd uh so why why is the president invited you would you not go to the White House\nWhere I think he's been voting condescending and and\nSo lacking in any sensitivity or knowledge\nOf how American history you know central to American history has the story of black history so when he says things like calling a black woman Omarosa a dog or calling another black woman a congresswoman Maxine Waters who is a tremendous from critic but he says extraordinarily low IQ\nHe engages in politically or you know advantageous tactics I guess with his base like saying the first black president wasn't born in this country and then he uses that\nTo elevate his profile I think this man is just about the fighting in the country about beating people racial hate and I'm not going to be in his company\n[noise] okay [noise] well when you say that ... ... you're you're now he's going to be you you don't expect that he is going to be removed from office do you\nI don't know I mean I don't know what Mueller has in terms of the Mueller probe if that's what you're talking about\nNow and I'm just talking generally he's going to be president for another two plus years two years three months and um [noise] okay ... during that time period\nAnd and this is a part of the the challenge after your book and and let me back up for a moment because a lot of people may not know but one you wrote a courageous book they got you lots and lots of attacks on the left it was a book called enough subtitle is the only leaders\nDead end movements and culture of failure that are undermining black America\nAnd what we can do about correct and one of the things you talked about was\nHaving um black leadership the talk more about achievement and a lot less of a constant sense of grievance aren't aren't aren't you coming into that trap that that you yourself described in your book enough\nNo in fact I Wish that the president President Trump would celebrate the idea of black achievement in this society\nInstead of you know always talking about black people in the way he says oh you know they live in circumstances worse than Afghanistan their neighborhoods filled with violence and poverty and joblessness and bad schools\nI'm thinking wait a second that's your description of black American twenty Eighteen\nI mean right now Michael forty percent of black Americans are in between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars an additional twelve percent between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars\nSo you can see a majority of black America is either in the middle class or beyond this is one of the prime achievements of the civil rights era inhibition nights they obviously the growth of black political voice in power as part of American society\nSo these are tremendous achievement so I'm all about looking at how people who were faced with such disadvantage in this society slavery legal segregation ongoing racial bias and all the red nonetheless\nHave sought out the American dream and have kept it alive and and want to succeed ... you know like the Jefferson slogan they want to move on up right\nAbsolutely good stuff but this president instead he focuses on the twenty percent who who are in poverty disproportionately young people and kids often times because of broken families on the like\nAnd he makes set out to be the entirety of the black but like they're all going to mug you going to take your job or are they going to ruin your schools I think it is just so deceitful and dangerous because again it is racially divisive\nOkay I again I I some of the same uh comments by President Trump and gestures by President Trump I've been highly critical of on this radio show a because I'm not one of those people who believe that President Trump can do nothing right or nothing but\nI also I'm a believer not one of those people things President Trump can do nothing wrong and I'm not one of those people things we can do nothing right and he must be doing something right because we've covered on the air before\nThey're a bunch of polls and it's not just ... and there are six major polls that show that his approval rating and the black community has been going up\nAnd largely that's because we do have a blank unemployment rate that is the lowest ever measured that people have been making the kind continuing the kind of economic progress that you're talking about right\nFirst of all the polls that you're talking about is a poll that by its own admission has too few black people polled so what you get is a a distortion the reality is with and I find that this is so troubling about\nA two thirds of Americans think race relations or worse today under President Trump than they've been in the past you also get higher levels are getting more than fifty percent disapproving of how Trump handles race relations\nAnd the most difficult one for me to accept and I think this may surprise you Michael is it forty nine percent of Americans say Trump is a racist and the reason that bothers me is I think it just shuts down a power station if you say something so flatly than people think oh I'm a Trump supporter or I'm not\nBut I don't want that I really want people to think about how\nThis country is becoming more diverse you're getting greater sense of global economic and cultural mixing and how do we deal with that when you have a president who's so I think the vice if on racial issues immigration\nOkay so let's let's approach that approach how other leaders can change and how the president can change to deal with this more effectively yeah what the hell do you have to lose [noise] that's the title of the new book by Juan Williams' movie right back [noise]\nWhere I think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling a charge against the nominee in the comic case it was ... hill and you know it was very slow to come out but then the\nCommittee the Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they missed that she wasn't put her name to it and then it got leaked and then he came out so it's very similar because look at professor for she sent a letter to a congressman as shoe and it makes its way to Dianne Feinstein\nI and then her name is Lee or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ... ... things similar to me is a level that charge I don't think that anybody that ah you know Clarence Thomas ... on a bed or\nYeah but my one there's a difference in touch and the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do and he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission it was a government official and he was already yellow graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh has to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYeah but I think that the larger issue here is a matter of character for someone who's going to be on the highest court in the land\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics that I Wish you hadn't done it because they you know the whole presentation of himself at the urging of choir boy he's just a a book is\nThe was and then all of his friends like this guy was a big grin and he loved the parties don't count\nOkay Wade flu if you were a U.S senator and who knows you maybe some day I don't really\nMight have been for both of ... Washington D. C. becomes a fifty first day which probably won't happen but not even\nA one um would you vote for ... confirmation\nNo on at this point\nAnd the main reason would be because the way he presented himself as the hearing\nYeah I think especially last week when he went off you making all sorts of for generations or got Clinton conspiracy theory again and the Democrats are I'm thinking wait a minute\nYears if you're trying to be a judge on the Supreme Court you're just displaying a tremendous lack with ... and prevent\nOr don't or they're given given the amount of money that was spent by

Soros project or sometimes they can can you well I unfortunately I think we are\nOut of time of the book doesn't have anything to do with Brett Kavanaugh but of course\nAt the moment that is it an issue that seems to touch almost everything the book is called what the hell do you have to lose its claws subtitle is Trump's more on civil rights Juan Williams of Fox News always appreciate talking

okay and what you should hopefully\nIs a kind of a lawsuit like not frivolous lawsuit any kind of a lawsuit keep it you know impose on the food on the proceedings if it turns out it's just a false allegation\nUh you can be sure that every single senator\nShow up and we'll be talented\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd remarkably enough uh at the FBI seems to be close to completing its investigation a a an update over at the hill\nSays the FBI is said to be wrapping up its investigation of the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what do they found well we don't exactly know\nKnew or as the Republicans repeated again and again when they were resisting the idea of this extra\nFBI investigation\nWill they come up and say well we found that he's guilty as sin or we found that he is as white as the driven snow or or I shouldn't say white was innocent as the driven snow\nOr because I think it's very very tough when\nVirtually all of the principles in this debate are white uh it's it's very tough to find some means of making a racial issue but of course Democrats have been trying and trying and trying it I'm\nSteve Gomez the former FBI special agent he's a was special agent in charge of Los Angeles which is one of the most important\nBureau or offices and the country\nHe said it wasn't unusual that the FBI was not going to be viewing Ford they were not going to be interviewing Christine Blasey Ford they're not going to be interviewing a judge Kavanaugh again I mean after all each of them spent hours\nIn front of the Senate Judiciary committee plus they have both been extensively interviewed by the staff of the Judiciary Committee apparently the um and and this by the way I think is a syndicated that judge Kavanaugh\nSpent more hours over thirty total speaking to the staff of the Judiciary Committee than any other nominee\nFor the Supreme Court or for all of the others combined and with more questions asked I think it's safe to say that he is the the first nominee where where his drinking\nIn a high school and college has become a serious issue by the way that was not the subject of the the FBI background investigation apparently they are speaking to Deborah Ramirez who had made those comments about his freshman year at Yale in the basement of Lawrence hall\nAnd and here\nLet let me speak personally for just a moment because as people know listen to this show I went to jail once upon a time\nAnd uh I did my first year at Yale Law school and so this was before a judge Kavanaugh or was anywhere close to the campus in New haven\nBut at places like that are very tradition bound the culture doesn't change that dramatically\nAnd is it the idea that drinking is a very big deal for a lot of people in college I think that's true\nI mean breaking news and once they're their own jails songs including the ... song which is very well known it became a smash hit\nEarl about drinking\nThere are there there are lots of ah lots of references and this goes back to songs dating to the nineteenth century\nAnd I I Will say that does that mean that everybody gets drunk all the time no I I I was thinking about it and I\nI didn't drink and college sorry um I Wish I could say I didn't look I turned out okay and where at least I think I did um but no I um I I did not imbibe I didn't like the taste of beer at that time\nAnd a and most of the people that I knew\nSort of and I write about this and right turns I I talk a little bit about my ears it yeah and part of what happened is in the late sixties there was a transition and people who have been very obsessed with beer became very obsessed with pot\nWhich I thought it was more obnoxious I mean really more obnoxious because people made a ... a religious thing of it with him flashing strobe\nLight says oh man oh wow this is so amazing\nAnd I don't really think that the buddy\nBrett Kavanaugh are not members of ... not not anybody\nOr had the idea that drinking beer was a pact with ... uh I Know I don't think that was the\nCase so maybe at the University of North Carolina they've just published and this is part of the very needed role of a free press there's a website That's published some photos including photos of Christine Blasey Ford\nDuring her years at Chapel Hill and University of North Carolina\nAnd showing her as something of a party girl there is a statement\nDiscovered now in the New York times today the New York times not just Fox News it's the New York times is covering the allegations by her former live in boyfriend\nWho says that all of this stuff about how she was traumatized they were dating for ... years they knew each other casually virtue they were dating for six years between Nineteen Ninety two and Nineteen Ninety eight and he says a number of unpleasant things abound\nA doctor ... Ford\nNow is that off limits\nWell he's do ... questioning her credibility for instance on this stuff that she was afraid of flying and that's why she couldn't make it to the hearings to testify earlier when it was very obvious to everybody that well this is nonsense they they asked her\nRitual Miller asked her about her flying and she said oh no I'm not really afraid of flying so why did you tell that to the committee and doesn't this go to the issue of credibility\nAll all of this stuff it seems to me that\nIf you are going to come forward\nAbout something that happened too long ago from what you feel you have never ever ever recovered what do you have to expect that there will be some pushback and um [noise] the the way the New York times highlights their story\nAh Christine Blasey Ford's\nCredibility under new attack by Senate Republicans but ah includes the following the former boyfriend told the Judiciary Committee that he witnessed personally Dr Blass Z helping a friend prepare for a possible polygraph examination contradicting her testimony under oath\nDr Blass Z a psychology professor from California who also goes by are married name Ford was asked during the hearing whether she'd ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test she answered never let the former boyfriend whose name was redacted from a copy of the sworn statement provided\nTo the Judiciary Committee\nSaid that when they were together in the late Nineteen Ninety see saw Dr Blass use\nHer understanding of psychology to assist her roommate of the time Monica element clean before interviews for possible position positions with the FBI or the U.S attorney's office that might require her to take a lie detector test\nQuote I witnessed Dr Ford helped make lean prepare for a potential polygraph exam demands and the statement Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect\nHow polygraph works and help me clean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nMeanwhile ms McLean who is a former FBI agent denied the assertion today she says I have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else very me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I've taken it anytime okay so\nHere's a disagreement\nDo we know who to believe here know do we know who to believe between a doctor Ford and judge Kavanaugh will we are going to find out a little bit more about the other witnesses\nAnd yes she identified it was Dr Ford who came up with a name BJ's mice and I'm a ... or her good friend who says she's never met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd so she couldn't have been at that party Brett Kavanaugh was in fact that that party\nAnd then mark judge and what is the FBI likely to say and how was the vote likely to go and who will decide this final vote will get to that with your calls coming up on the ... one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\n\nAt the hearing what he was angry was ranting he was ...
