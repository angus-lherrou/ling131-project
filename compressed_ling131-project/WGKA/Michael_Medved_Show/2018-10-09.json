Care how would you like to live in the ... in a county where no health insurance then you know people who say single payer Medicare for all what what sound very clearly from overly\nWait wait wait that's my point ... forgive me that's what people would like they would they would like single payer for all I I I Would be very interested to see if we took a national vote only on that question would you like to nationalized healthcare every one is covered and doesn't have to pay dues\n\nWould just take it out of ... people now are forced to want that because the health insurance premium for double\nDouble right oh no no no All right so you have no no no no no I hear what you're saying so you have very articulate spokespeople on the other side saying folks don't vote for that your premiums will go down if we have medicine the same way we have food and everything else competitively priced\nSo we will have articulate people argue why am I hear you perfectly\nThey'll say no no no don't worry you will have premiums obviously because it's going to be a private insurance market\nAnd then the other side will say folks don't you just want to be taken care of and not have this worry every civilized country in the western world after all has nationalized healthcare they're doing fine just ask your Canadian friends\nAnd I I Would be very curious to see what the voters\nI mean that's the direction we're moving into Michael that's the point I'm not selling the American people short\nThe American people are ... are people and they have been the Americanized in terms of values that's what's happened American people who still uh from liberty in God we trust e pluribus unum the American trinity aren't going to vote for nationalized healthcare\nBut people for whom liberty a secondary to being taken care of they will and by the way and that's part of the reason that people who believe in ... more government than liberty walk more immigrants because no matter by the way it doesn't matter where the immigrants come from\nHim every immigrant comes from a country on a society that values being taken care of more than liberty\nBecause there's only one country on earth that

majority of them not all by any means dropped the word all the great majority come from countries societies mindset that value being taken care of more than they value liberty\nThat's one of the

[noise]\nShe's trying to make a comeback or what is her connection\nAnd the connection of her declaration was a surprise announcement by Nikki Haley of one of the finest members of the Trump Administration she has been outstanding as our ambassador to the un\nWhat is really going\nOn behind the Haley resignation which was announced today she isn't a resigning immediately she's going to stay on the un for her sons I Know I'm again I'm not as some implying that there are any sense on the part of Nikki Haley as she has been a a\nTerrific UN ambassador in fact one of the best ever and um we will see what comes next with her and what her resignation is really all about ... who is likely to replace her\nAnd the United nations we'll also talk about a new poll which shows what seems to me to be a contradiction to CNN poll and it shows that\nSupport for President Trump is going up\nAnd going up fairly dramatically at the same time support for Brett Kavanaugh's going down\nSo what's the story there we will get to that and also to the arrest of a a teacher for something he tweeted\nAnd it's something that is very very macho see as woke or he is clearly on the left and he also\nIs just lost his job what could he possibly have said that would cause him to lose a job we will get to that as well and to a a stay at home dad [noise] middle aged\nSounds like a very nice guy who confesses that um he's a pot addict and I tried marijuana addict and he makes the case that marijuana is a profoundly addictive drug\nOr we will get to that as well but first the reactions\nTo what is going on in our country right now to the swearing in ceremony last night a judge Kavanaugh was already sworn in as justice Kavanaugh on Saturday Night so he's been an official member of the Supreme Court for a while\nBut President Trump I think very rightly wanted to stage a formal swearing in and it was a wonderful occasion\nHe had a judge Kavanaugh's family there he had all the justice is the Supreme Court with their roof ... Ginsberg was there dancing and celebrating and wasting a few Bruce gays or no that's not true that part but she was there and uh\nThat's that's appropriate and that's important and I think the judge Kavanaugh justice Kavanaugh spoke very well and President Trump\nA President Trump did not speak as outrageously or as badly as a liberal media or try and suggest and we'll get to that place of of where you can tell you why but first off on this issue of civility which remains a very very big and divisive issue in the country\nBut there was a contribution to civility from a contributor over at MSNBC and this is very much appreciate does it puts the situation and such good focus that this is a big contribution from Eli missed all\nAbout making a deal with the devil\nBacks up his Vargas alright for Donald Trump has delivered for these people on the things that they care about most\nThe of delivered racism for these people the liver massage any for these people and now he's delivered the Supreme Court for these people which is something that they've been trying to get for a generation we're going to the if if it's a way that they now have control over all three branches of government\nWe're going to see if it's raining lasts for thirty days or two years\nAnd you hear what\nA thousand you're right that's a ... a guy\nThat's of course what a Adolph Hitler proclaim than his house in ... vice\nLasted exactly twelve years a look at ... ... ... when he says has delivered for these people are we back to the basket of deplorable is that we're ... who are these people to whom President Trump is delivered racism and massage any\nAnd where is the son Janine American Life right now is it a\nThe idea that there is a lack of civility on the right how was it civil to suggest that a President Trump\nIs making a deal with President Trump is a deal with the devil or that the people to whom he has delivered massage any and racism and corruption and horror and misery and and just general awfulness\nAre actually diabolical one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then there's this um Tom Sawyer who was invested\nI think it's upwards of twenty million so far I think it's way above twenty million might be upwards of fifty million so far he spent on ads pushing the impeachment of Donald Trump\nHe spoke out on who to blame for everything that is going wrong in America here's Tom Sawyer\nA group of very rich very entitled white men wanted to tell the rest of the country we are going to have our way and if you don't like it that is too darn bad\nHail as far as I'm the only thing that everybody else can do now the the rest of America is go to the balls on November ... pill those Richard titled white men that we exist and democracy exist\nOkay just a question um is Tom Steyer a man after yeah he is I think he currently identifies a as a male even assist gender ...\nIs the white yeah he's white is he rich yeah is he in titled yeah\nSo I I don't understand this is this is all the folder rich entitled white men\nAnd was this kind of thing going on on the left basically suggesting that as rich and title white men who were controlling things against the public interest\nUh ... visited seem a little bit bizarre for the defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to say that well we need now is a new civility but there's only one way to achieve civility you know what it is here's what she had to say on CNN\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect is strength and you heard how the Republican members led by Mitch McConnell the president\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nDemand the confirmation process where were they the ones who brought up a drinking games in high school where they the ones who are brought up\nObsessively looking at a high school yearbook and even a general references in the high school yearbook how is it that Republicans demeaned the confirmation process and and what about this notion that the only way that we can restore civility is um\nIs somehow to ah\nHave the Democrats back in control heaven forbid one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six she also in the same interview Hillary said what was done last night and the wife was a political rally\nIf further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government\nUm okay it\nWas she watching what was she wants me she was watching the Saturday Night live cold open\nWhich showed people celebrating in our locker room if you actually watch and we should posted on our website Jeremy if you actually watch the ceremony with President Trump and justice Kavanaugh and Justice Kennedy very much in evidence the mentor\nOf justice Kavanaugh who swore and then again\nWhy was that unsuitable I I I honestly\nA jump was asked about this briefly and about Hillary saying that the swearing in ceremony was no good it was a political rally it was inappropriate here's the president\nBush responses over [laughter]\nI guess that's where she lost [noise] she doesn't get it [noise] she never did I knew that a long time\nAgo [noise] Hillary never got it [noise] that's why she lost [noise]\nAnd and by the way when you talk about political event [noise]\nWas uh what judge Kavanaugh said political about wanting to be a justice who was there\nHe said all nine of us just as the Supreme Court review of the constitution and yes that includes Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan Steven briar [noise] we will be right back uh with your calls coming up on one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nAnd the Iran deal bringing attention to the world\nEvery country any ... can't\nThings they're doing do you have to see them for the ...

strong case as you can make and none none of what she said can you argue it it's all the truth\nAnd yes she was part of it but all of this did happen under President Donald Trump\nAnd this is one of the reasons I suppose that on the CNN poll a despite the fact that there has been so much hysteria on the left about Kevin on and the the various powers that are alleged to have been perpetrated by old white males led by Donald Trump\nThe President Trump actually saw his approval rating rising look as far as Nikki Haley is concerned\nThere's a lot of talk about her replacement\nAnd some of the talk that is most inflammatory as the idea that the president is going to appoint his daughter Yvonne ...\nWhy would that make any sense ... has traveled around the world as she speaks very well uh

powerful piece a written by a writer named Neil Patel like that appeared in the New York times under the heading I'm just a middle aged\nHouse dad addicted to pot and\nHe writes about going to his first marijuana anonymous meeting in West Hollywood\nThat it'd be almost a year ago\nWho is friday night in the room was packed with addicts semi age with most younger struggling to recover life lost to weed\nAnd then he writes this and I think it's extraordinarily powerful I mean seriously powerful he says that there's a reason that Alcoholics Anonymous started in Nineteen thirty five\nWhat's the reason that was two years after the end of prohibition alcohol abuse became rampant and the country almost rank itself off the rails was the same thing happened with marijuana\nNow by the way this is really important because it's historically true most people think oh you know probation was a gigantic failure people drank just as much under prohibition\nAnd then they ended prohibition and everything was happy this by the way it was a big Republican democratic issue was one of the first things have Franklin Roosevelt did when the Democrats came to power\nOr was end the prohibition amendments to uh go ahead and repeal the prohibition of men\nBut the truth of the matter is drinking did go up when prohibition went away and they'd go down when prohibition was imposed now was it worth it I'm not suggesting prohibition of alcohol I'm also not in the midst of fighting a war here to reimpose prohibition on marijuana in Washington state\nBut here's the message from Neal Pollack says marijuana isn't alcohol or an opioid you cannot die from an overdose it doesn't really events physical cravings so is it better to call my problem marijuana dependence doesn't matter\nAnd now from the bench of our nation's highest court your father will defend the eternal rights and freedoms of all Americans you know [noise]\nOkay this is just fine and it's touching because you can look at the way they count on family his daughters Margaret ... we're looking up at him and his wife Ashley when when President Trump was saying these words and when he says saying he's a man of decency character kindness and courage\nThere is no one who has stood up to say anything different no one\n... and you know that if there were someone who said oh yeah ten years ago he cheated mayor ten years ago I saw him beating up somebody or as drunk or is that they would have come forward they wouldn't be publicized a great deal the best they could do\nWas to get three different women none of them had any corroborating evidence\nWho are charging them with being a jerk freshman year of college or in high school\nAnd [noise] sorry\nThat doesn't take away the idea that he has lived a lifetime showing himself to be a man of decency character kindness encouraged President Trump\nConcluded\nModerated allies as presidents tonight reminds us for his historic\nYour father is all about it's about what kind of a nation we're going to be and what kind of a country our children will inherit\nIt is up to each of us and do all Americans watching tonight to answer that question is up to us to reclaim our heritage of equal an impartial justice is up to us to really dedicate ourselves to be traditions and wisdom\nOf our founders and it is up to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection that leads us all together as one great American family [noise]\nAnything\nWrong with that it it doesn't seem to me that there is it seems to me that President Trump was in the right spirit for the occasion as he was with these last comments introducing the actual swearing and listen\nJust as kind of and also the place left by Anthony Kennedy\nSoon Justice Kennedy will administer the judicial both to Brett Kavanaugh just as you did last year for justice Gorsuch\nThis will be the first time a Supreme Court justice has every sworn in a former clerk to take his seat\nA beautiful moment which reminds us that freedom is a tradition passed down from generation to generation and that's a big statement and I want to thank you for the summer so [noise]\nIt is beautiful uh if if there's someone who really believes that this was a disgrace somehow that that President Trump ruined this occasion\nYou can give us a call and tell us why 'cause I don't see it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and judge Kavanaugh\nSpoke particularly beautifully\nAnd yes I I think that some of his enter changes with the senators at his hearing were more testy than they need to debate and yes he didn't answer all the questions about as high school yearbook perhaps perfectly\nBut you know what in the sweep of history I think President Trump is right the entire process here as manipulated by the likes of Dianne Feinstein and and as true\nAnd uh and Spartacus and Mazie Hirono and a Richard Blumenthal and Sheldon Whitehouse and the rest of them\nAnd that entire process will be remembered\nAs a sham and a disgrace and not a positive thing for the country so this is a good place to turn forward and move ahead\nWhen we come back we'll we'll go to your calls one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and we'll also play a most\nOf a judge Kavanaugh's justice Kevin O's brief but I think very moving and very well crafted remarks or we will be right back on the dawn of a new day and a new term for the Supreme Court of the United states coming up on the show [noise]\nJustice Kavanaugh swearing in prove that this president is our divider and she\nReally isn't ...\nWhen President Trump concluding his remarks said um is that the U.S to read a gay or sales to the traditions and wisdom of our founders and a desire to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection that link us all together as one great American family okay he acknowledged that it was unusual what he was doing\nBut I Do think that the process that victimized both Dr blessing forward and justice Kavanaugh to process was unusual and not admirable\nLou in Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the Michael ...\nSure\nI I Iran\nBut yeah um I mean I I don't you know when I look at what what he did he said he was completely um you know proven to be innocent\nUm he didn't he didn't investigate all the people who were actual witnesses that we're likely witness that would have more information it was not a thorough process so for him to go around and do that slap it in our face okay lawyer they voted in two thousand twelve for Obama didn't get Merrick Garland\nAny slap it in our face and say it's proven innocent they didn't even have a really the only investigation\nThat way when you say when you say phony investigation what do you mean who who are the witnesses or that\nThere were several there were several witnesses that the Ramirez woman\nI I understand they decide they made a decision they made it up because that was not their job what they were asked to do was to investigate Dr Ford and as far as Deborah Ramirez concern I mean come\nOn come on it's it's the idea but in other words what they didn't do the FBI and I think you're right not to do it was go through a whole investigation of I'm Brett Kavanaugh's drinking habits when he was a freshman at Yale or when he was a senior in high school\nWhy because it was irrelevant the question was if Deborah Ramirez has some magic witness that you could could uh for the fact which she even said by the way Deborah marriage she said I was too drunk to really remember this is what she saw it happen and it's a recovered memory and it was after the fact\nAnd this is pathetic what relevance does it have to his qualifications to be on the Supreme Court low\nSo my feeling is you were treated ten times better than Obama but and then Merrick Garland was\nOkay I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I guarantee you that Merrick Garland would prefer what happened with him which was great respect no one spoke harshly about him no one smearing him no one came up with things about his\nHigh school days or college days and probably because there is nothing but he did not get a hearing\nThat doesn't mean you're treated horribly
