of the figures on early voting is reported by NBC News\nShow big gains\nOr Republican [noise]\nIs it all means and where are we going and what about that blue wave that we're supposed to be drowning all conservatives hopes Hi John Fund who\nWrites about politics as well as just about anybody and has followed politics deciduous Lee He's also an expert because he wrote the book on it literally on the question of voter fraud and manipulating election John is a a columnist for National Review he has a contributor as Fox News\nAnd he has why is the blue wave looking more like a splash\nThen it soon I mean that's his latest piece at our at National Review John thanks very much for coming on the show\nA pleasure Michael I've always\nOkay right now a A N ... how many states approximately are people all ready sending in balance of course here in the state of Washington people are because they'll vote by mail\nThirty eight states have some form of early voting whether it's apps and to your uh you know showing up at a government office before the election\nOkay so let me put the word out to people anyone listening to us right now in one of those thirty eight states and you probably are\nI don't wait sending your ballot get it done that way you make sure you're making a contribution to this important national decision the consensus seems to be on the part of everybody who's looking at this Johnson that\nThe momentum seemed to turn around in a Republican direction after the Kavanaugh hearings you agree with that\n[noise] well I think a lot of people have big in the cake any negative attitudes they had the President Trump\nAnd I think that Trump's antics as a personality had depressed part of the Republican base but the Kavanaugh hearings brought out the ugliness of the left their complete disregard for normal procedures and rules and the rule of law\nAnd I think that at best that show the Democrats to be the\nEqual of Trump in the violating norms and politics and that word almost extra constitutional so I think that Trump managed to succeed where nobody else ever thought he would he managed to get the Democrats to drop their own to October surprise on their feet never to blow up in their face\nAnd yeah it's it does it does seem like that and I know there are a bunch of people like Dean Heller a who is long considered our most endangered a center of the center for Nevada\nHe strongly supported Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and that appears to have given him a boost I think they're running tied now right now in Nevada aren't they\nI think of the election were held today Republicans would lose none of their seats and the only question is what the Democrats lose two three or four years\nWow which means they of course Republican control of the Senate what about on the house side\n[noise] I Would say the Democrats because of a variety of good factories including the fact that uh\nYou know suburban women have become one of the most resistant groups against Trump twenty five point gender gap against them\nOr against Republicans I think there are sixty percent chance to take back the house but sixty percent of a lot lower than it was two or three weeks ago because I think that\nAs the issues start to be talked about you remember most of your listeners are into politics Michael you and I are the politics the average voter doesn't pay attentional took much closer to the election\nSo when they actually look at the issues this a center right country and if the Republicans frame the issues property they tend to close the gap in the last two weeks unless there's some extraneous about like the two thousand they try natural meld them\nOkay two two issues which are very much front and center at this moment uh one is the uh allege id horrible gas that President Trump made last night and used and when he called himself a nationalist do things is going to alienate millions and millions of American voters\nI think it may be hundreds and hundreds of reporters and journalists were once again appalled by the fact that the president is you know troll telling them\nI mean I noticed when he said and he said I Know I'm not supposed to say it but I'll faint anyway I mean look the president may not be the most elegant speaker but boy does he know how to use language as a weapon\nUp but he doesn't he was he what every ... years as a trigger word someone doesn't like he he pulls the trigger\nRight and a pulls the trigger on on then to watch their heads explode and\nIt's just extraordinary I'd like to hear people even offered to listeners to call up and say why nationalism was a bad word a one eight hundred nine ... Seventeen Seventy six our phone number go ahead\nIt has some bad historical antecedent but basically it's another sending them\nAnd I think you've pointed this out for patriotism yeah of course a\nAnd again the first three Senate ... that are listed when you just click on it on the Internet are national stealing a national uh as patriotic feeling pardon me patriotism and flag waving\nAnd uh nothing wrong with any of those three things what about we we had on yesterday and I Eric eggers who\nIs a very concerned about ah the confusion in American voting registration suggesting that as many as twenty four percent\nUh of registered voters right now are really shouldn't be voting and you've written about this um extensively do you think that's a very big problem two weeks in the day\nIt depends on the state\nOr you know I I hate to draw national brushing twenty four percent sure sounds high to me\nI think that the problem with voter fraud is it doesn't show up until the very end\nWith an election was closed and somebody gets desperate and they put their thumb on the scale and fend the street money out and it all happens quickly at the very end you know under the cover of a ... you know vans and everything else so we may not know what happens\nBut we do know that we need to watch for it and if there's anything untoward these bad whiff these lists like in Georgia you know these list these are not people are being prevented from voting it just means they have to show up at the polls and fill out a provisional ballot ... and ... and prevent their id\nIt doesn't we're not preventing anyone from voting we're just making sure the person who's voting is the person they say they are\nYeah I mean while I'm there is a um a this additional at any there's thirty six governorships that are up in in this election right now right\n[noise] yeah it's a big this is the big casino here and these these these governorships will help decide how redistricting is done after the next census which one to two years\nRight which will also help to determine whoever wins what will be a very close election you don't think there's any chance the Democrats win more than thirty seats to you\nThere oh no no no in fact I think I think the governorships they're going to be a lot of swaps the ... Democrats will take back some Midwestern states that have been in Republican control for a long time like Illinois and\nThe Republicans are going to take back I think there they'll take back states where the Democrats mismanaged the finances so bad that ah you know they've given up any chance of governing like Connecticut by the way even Oregon even Oregon make elect a Republican governor for the first time in Thirty years\nRight which would be amazing Buddhist Kate Brown ever deserve to be voted out of power in Oregon now there's one surprise to look for is there a Republican candidate against Angus King in Maine\nThere is but ah and he's a good guy but unfortunately Angus King has this impenetrable independent damage because he technically runs as an independent so he's got that nailed down\nOkay except I understood the New York times today ran of wanting piece about the Democrats there's a democratic nominee against Angus King whose name is Zach ringelstein and he apparently is a big Bernie Sanders guy he's been endorsed by democratic socialist\nIf we could encourage ... anybody listening to us up in Maine vote your conscience vote for the real socialist votes or ringelstein than Democrats and makes his who's right there has to be at least forty percent something like that all votes the Republican anyway right\n[noise] well you know all all I'll say is that when you're trying to remember who to vote for king does beat rankled Stein\n[laughter] ... yes in in terms of the future but I I assume that the Republican candidate to do more than ringelstein as well as any other surprises that you think we should look out for on election day\nYeah Minnesota Senate race the seat that Al Franken resigned from there's an appointed incumbent named Tina Smith Michael last night they had the only debate the Democratic candidate didn't\nShow up refused to show up fighting scheduling difficulties there was one candidate on the stage the Republican candidate and left the podium\nWow and uh\nBy the way as close to the polls it's a fixed point race according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune which does Republicans do favors at its poles\nThat is terrific I'm actually going to be in Minnesota and a campaign event on Thursday night there are three red hot congressional races in Minnesota there's two Senate races one of them not so red hot where I think isn't senator club is on the ballot to\nSince the real problem as the forty empty seats right there were forty Republicans ... or more\nEmpty seats in decades and that's why I think the Democrats do have to be favored to take back the house because at an open seat a basically you're much more able to vote party street party line\nSo I'm In in terms of I Know that the Republicans have a\nGood chance of knocking on some democratic seats I Know there's a district in Minnesota where the Republicans actually now favored by the cook Political Report\nTo win a democratic seat um ... where do you think Republicans should place the emphasis in these last two weeks the campaign in order to try to hold on to the house\n[noise] well I think that they have to emphasize three things one is you know even though there are problems in the world were peace and frankly we are more respected now than we were two years ago that the number one\nTo the economy is really good and that's not an accident or ... or ... policies having a delayed reaction if you want higher taxes and want to take a risk with picking the economy backwards vote for the Democrats the takeover Congress and the third is\nYou know are there some basic things the Democrats don't seem to care about one of the rule of law is proven by Kavanaugh\nAnd to why are they saying nothing about this caravan this mob whatever you want to call it that moving up from Mexico as the wall Street Journal reported today which is very pro immigration this is outrageous that we have these people encouraged to move to the United states that influence our election\nAimed at the same time the Democrats are completely silent a fundamental issue of national sovereignty\nAnd apparently this is the work of a former president of Honduras and his henchmen or what's the wall Street Journal is written about in the Daily Beast is written about that this really started or\nAs as basically a means of undermining the currents center right president of Honduras and to hold the American people hostage to the vagaries of ... door and dirty tricks campaigning\nDoesn't seem a good idea Jon or of the\nDemocrats need to step forward and say this is wrong and I hear crickets cricket\nWell exactly what they have nothing to say because again they would much prefer to a run on the the the the family separation issue which they tried to make a great deal of apparently sixty two percent of all democratic ads of each or health care isn't that a mistake don't you think\nWell it's putting lots of eggs in one basket and you know I think pre existing conditions are important I don't think they're that important to that many American\nOkay and the Republicans have been very emphatic that we are not going to endanger people with preexisting conditions at those guarantees will remain\nA we are speaking with John Fund John appreciate your insight\nAnd I hope I'm maybe you can come back again before we have the occasion for a a post

should be white or black or Latino or Asian and she said for you kids watching at home Santa justice white\nJust because it makes you feel uncomfortable doesn't mean it has to change you know I mean Jesus was a white man to\nThis was not a good thing to say especially given the fact that um\nI I really do not believe that a Jesus had a racial identity that he spoke about or was aware of\nHe had an identity as a Jewish person but ah as people anyone goes to never Israel will see a Jewish people come in all different color coding\nUh okay so ...\nMegan Kelly dons this ah gets into this conference this morning she has already apologized\nUm one uh\nOne source at NBC says many seasoned journalists felt main how his comments or an insult to the profession okay what happened is she is already apologized and do we have a text the apology\nSomewhere here I'm In any event she regrets deeply and I think we can go on from that particular harm to um to more controversy\nAnd uh and and there's this um [noise]\nThere's a great deal of controversy about Stacey Abrams who is a candidate for governor changed the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia and she's running as Brian Kemp who is the Republican has the states ... states Stacey Abrams a state senator\nAnd a ...\nHere here's the problem is a two fold problem one of the items that seems to me is more of a problem than the other and ah\nThe one that's getting all the attention today is a CNN is reporting democratic candidate to be judges next governor explained her presence Tuesday at a Nineteen Ninety to protest that included burning the state flag she said that was part of her opposition to Confederate symbolism\nHer a\nInvolving came to light on social media and the statement to CNN Abrams campaign said that the actions in college where part of a permitted peaceful protest against the Confederate emblem in the flag is part of Georgia State flag\nAt the time of the protest in Nineteen Ninety to the states flags states flag contained the Confederate battle flag emblem which had been a prominent feature of the state flag since it was adopted Nineteen fifty six when the battle over the segregation was raging in the south\nThe Confederate battle flag emblem wasn't fully recover removed from the states flag until two thousand three\nAnd then the statements than the uh Stacey Abrams campaign says during Stacey Abrams college years Georgia was at a crossroads struggling with how to overcome racially divisive issues including symbols of the confederacy the sharpest of which was the inclusion of the Confederate am woman at Georgia State flag\nThen it goes on to say a crunch time in public service as deputy city attorney in a state legislative leader of all been focused on bringing people together to solve problems or educate the fact that back in Nineteen Ninety two she participated in a demonstration against the state flag\nThat's not a problem it seems to me and shouldn't be a big problem in our campaign it's a long time ago and the flag was changed anyway she's not burning contemporary Georgia flag I'll tell you what is a problem she has gone on record\nAnd she is standing by an amount basically blowing up the largest Confederate monument to the mall and this is one then I have spoken about this before on this whole issue of Confederate monuments\nI I Can't understand why you would decide not to blow anything up but to move a statue for instance the best example is a New Orleans\nThey had a statue of Robert he lay on top of a pillar and it really looked over the whole city and it was sort of like the Nelson's statue on top of a pillar and for ... square in Great Britain in London\nAnd having Robert de Leon such a prominent place looking over the whole I get it problem\nDon't blow it up but they and I don't know what they're putting on top of that pillar of anything made it to evolve pillar down they move all the statue okay\nBut when you're talking about Stone Mountain I actually looked it up the Stone Mountain memorials bigger than Mount Rushmore it's carved into the side of a mountain it took about Thirty years to do all the carving it was a very very big undertaking\nAnd inner side of the mountain is an image of Jefferson Davis president of the confederacy Robert ... commander of the army of northern Virginia and his chief lieutenant Thomas Jonathan Jackson Stonewall Jackson and they're all riding along\nAnd Stacey Abrams is taken the position that that monument has to be removed and trashed and honestly I don't understand it\nThere are lots of African Americans in the state of Georgia Stone Mountain by the wage over three thousand acres a beautiful beautiful park\nAnd it is owned I'm pretty sure by the city of Atlanta is three thousand acres and their trails they used to have a whole neo Confederate theme park is the New York times points out where they had a plantation house that's all gone if they put up appropriate signage that looks at the side of this mountain\nAs a historical symbol wouldn't that be a better way to go than simply San blasting it or ruining it are knocking it down and because of the size of Stone Mountain\n... wouldn't mind to the Taliban remember them they blew up these Buddhas because they took over the Buddhist were over twelve hundred years old and they blew them up in the ... valley\nAnd uh basically that was a that was before September eleventh and I went on the air and I talked about it and I said this is an act of terrorism\nAgainst the past and\nLook I understand that you can move a statue but the notion that you have to blow up the whole mountainside\nIt's it's a little bit nutty in the the New York times they point out that the\nDavid Huckabee who is a Georgia syndicated columnist no relation to the White House press secretary\nAssailed Missouri rivers position\nRating that she intends to run the most racist than divisive campaign and the history of Georgia politics\nRemoving such symbols won't keep one black father at home with his family won't take a single illegal weapon off of a single street in a single black neighborhood\nAnd a ... look I I understand that the whole history behind the Stone Mountain monument\nWith a at a time when white supremacy and neo Confederate apologetic were held to be the gates but we're very different place in our country right now\nBut to literally blast away there's three acres the image of Jackson Lee Ann Davis covers three acres on the face of this mountain and the idea of just blasting it up it it seems to me that a number there in a number of black leaders in Atlanta\nWho do believe that that it's a Neal's lea polarizing and pointless to insist on blowing up a a beautiful city park let's go\nTo John in Kansas City John you're on the Michael meant that show hey\nYou know my heart and um well you're very good record you made it and I'll listen listen to your ... okay maybe in fact build their their heritage ...\nNo no I never I never say that this is their heritage I never say that they have because the heritage of treason should be rejected\nAll right okay okay well here in the outfit you find that it's so beautiful historical and all that I Would you feel the below the Stone Mountain of Adolf Eichmann I'm Rick killer and all that they don't they lost the war to they were fighting for their country that their heritage\nBut again and again I I I Would I Do not use the argument of heritage and that's not the point the point is if there was if there is an artwork and piece of art is carved into a mountain that can't be moved because you cannot move aid three acres sculpture that it took Thirty years to make you only blow it up\nOr if there's something like that it's different from moving a statue and I again I Do not believe that they're at I think it's important to preserve for instance I don't think that ...\nShould be blown up I think it's important that it be preserved it is part of the record of history\nAnd they didn't have any statues announcements but if they had them there that should be preserved as part of the historical record as well\nAnd given the fact that\nAh they've taken out some of the they used to have a plantation house\nAt a Stone Mountain I think they still have a place that was there recently they still have a place called Confederate house but Confederate house doesn't have anything inside it any more they just have ... Stone Mountain\nAnd or should it have anything inside of that some people get Confederate souvenirs no of course not because you're right this is a dark chapter of American history is not one to be celebrated\nBut that doesn't mean it seems to me following the Taliban example of blowing up monuments from a different era we will be right back on the ... show [noise]\n\nNine twenty theater\n[noise]\nWith us or news on board the ribbon officials released the names of all Web and victims during a news conference earlier today on all of them middle aged or elderly the victims of synagogue are included a pair of brothers and a husband and wife\nYou'll just Ninety seven years old remote Israel's president is sending a message of solidarity after the mass shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue saying that Israel stands with the Jewish victims and the Pittsburgh community\nBrazil's outgoing president Michel ... says his government is ready to begin by hand over to the new government being chosen in Sunday's election voted in Sao paolo and told reporters a transition will start tomorrow or the day after tomorrow\nUS government investigating Mercedes Benz alleging that the German automaker has been slow to mail safety recall notices and Bob regard required reports involving recalls over one point four million vehicles this was ...\n\nMusic is a bridge between the material in the spiritual [noise]\nMy name is Harvey lower and\nAs a blind person you have to be aware\nNobody can tell you what you can or can't do you really have to try\nMy folks got me a little ... radio in Nineteen forty\nThat was the ...

Seventy two I went to come out several times have very fond memories of part\nIt's a beautiful park it's a lovely at is so big and spacious hiking trails and you can hike up to the ... the top of that mountain\nNo no we really just went by the mountains and then we went to the fact that ram up they don't feel they are not um I'd rather going by the gift shop and buying a artificial Confederate dollar that I still have to this day um they were high memories you know\nI don't think they I don't really they offer any Confederate money anymore I Know they don't offer Confederate flags and the gift shop yeah but go ahead yeah\nBut um what what I think is going to happen as the people around the country are you going to realize that this is not the deep blue state as people believe\nI was chairman for half a decade of the G O P A state party and we know by data and also by looking at our legislature were split halfway down the middle and so when that happened that's not an indication of a\nOf a deep blue state where a purple state and and and\nBy the way and this is one of the important things that if you actually when the Senate race or that could turn out enough Republicans to flip both houses of the state legislature 'cause it's one vote in the Senate and what is it one one now yeah both and so what would change one seat there and then makes a a world of difference I'm Sorry\nGo ahead and it ... the right if we have our voters vote all the way up and down the ballot or\nThat is exactly what's going to happen and the other thing that people don't realize is there an awful lot of good Democrats who have become very disenchanted with their party there not socialist they don't want this new vision that had been so articulated by the Seattle's city council\nA lot of your listeners around the country heard about that head tax that they pass\nAnd uh we were ridiculed across the country for it because they were going to fight homelessness by basically forcing employers to lay people off because they couldn't afford to pay this hadn't tax to the city and that's the kind of crazy ridiculous taxation that people in this state are fed up with and\nAnd your opponent is on record of wanting higher\nTax rates absolutely and she voted against the tax cuts in jobs bill she said she would rescinded\nA there is like all these big government Democrats there is not attack they don't love it's another way to get people's money and the people in this country are seeing a new way\nAnd that thanks to Donald Trump kind of it doing with his policies are what hasn't been done in a very long time and I particularly loved in our state and across the country that unemployment rates are so low for our ethnic and minority communities\nAnd um I again you're you're running a very vigorous campaign you're out there all the time you you can't match I'm Maria in terms of money I mean she's been there three full terms in the U.S Senate um what's what would be your first priority if you actually won this thing\nWell we have a lot of priorities in this state and a lot of people may not realize that we were inundated with forest fire smoke based on very bad policies that keep us from clearing out the under brush and getting rid of that tinder\nUh it's ready to explode the moment there is a forest fire we have had catastrophic forest fires in our federal for us and that's got to change and that is one of the first things I Would do\nAnother thing is we are really hurting when it comes to transportation and because our state is so poorly respected in the halls of power we have very little cloud to bring home any kind of money from the federal government and I said I can bring home that the federal dollars for infrastructure that my opponent has been unable\nTo do was harshly because he can work with the Trump admitted strictly and and but also partially because I think you share with the Trump Administration to desire to move us to fixing our roads rather than building new choo choo train those are friends ... refers to them yes uh that actually go nowhere\nExactly you know we're on the cusp of a very exciting time in transportation a cleaner cars and and the ability to use a\nA phone app to find a drivers and writers in order to a\nDouble up and triple up in car pools like we've never seen before you know kind of an ... version of transportation for the community and there are so many new innovative things that are coming down the road it's just a shame to use the phrase it's just a shame that we spend so much time wasting billions of dollars on a\nOn not getting our folks to and from work and back home to visit with their families for the rest of the day so I'm I feel very strongly about if there there's another thing that really affects all of that and this is nationwide it's bringing down the cost of higher education\nAnd we know the federal government has been a major role in increasing those costs and uh we've got to step in the time has come and it's an issue that I think all of that around the country are going to be working on\nA what a what are some of the promising ways you could bring down the ridiculous cost of higher education\nWell the the biggest one is that a federal use of of loans or that has allowed the costs at the university is to go skyrocketing\nNo of course with the federal government under writing all all of these loans including for people who just go for a year or two and don't even have a college degree to show for it we're speaking with Susan Hutchison\nShe is a

General in the air force your husband is a colonel in the marine corps and I didn't realize is you have a son now is the second lieutenant and Marine Corps um what do you think about the national security implications of this now very famous caravan that is heading toward our southern border\nWell we have tested in polling over the last several months and uh our voters believe that immigration is the number one issue in America and even though we're up here in this northwest corner of the country they really care about it because it is a national security issue and uh\nSo the people that I talk to you it doesn't matter what party they're in they're deeply concerned about what the implications are of thousands of people storming our southern border it's a frightening thought\nThis is

arrested\nBud well before Mr ... was captured long time Hillary Clinton operative Felipe grains went on CNN of course and said we all know who is ultimately responsible for this\nI think you have to ask how much Donald Trump is responsible for the climate that we're in for things like this happen\nIt is notable that went into vowed Democrat shot Republican Congressman Steve skull eastern almost killed him Republicans resist the urge to blame left his rhetoric and violence\nDo not expect the Democrats to do the same given they're almost pathological hatred of President Trump and mid term elections being just over a week away\nMeanwhile amidst all the usual history onyx of the silly season leading up to the elections magnified of course in the Donald Trump era\nNBC in the wall Street Journal released what amounts to something of a shock poll this week showing President Trump's approval number reaching its high water mark forty seven percent\nAndy trumped arranged talking heads on MORNING Joe on MSNBC owned of course by NBC reacted as you would expect members living in a detached bubble up the leftist establishment media to react\nWith disbelief and attacks on those supporting Trump here are Mika Brzezinski and Mike barnacles\nThink about that half\nOf the people in this country approve of the child is doing\nEven after Charlottesville porn star and has humiliation and health thinking ballet and Kim Jong il renting is from their mothers calling Hispanic sprinters destroying America less critical alliance is bankrupting our country and we can go on\nI Would submit\nThat the acceptance and deeply\nWe were deeply dishonest president the acceptance of that\nAmong people is the single most important issue of our day\nIt's as if nobody even voted for drought how could they but if they did their now once again being given the same deplorable label by the elite media that probably cemented Hillary Clinton's declined into oblivion\nIt's as if the media and their cohorts on the left learned absolutely nothing from the two thousand sixteen election and our intent on using the same failed tactics again to try and win control of Congress this year\nBut plenty more examples after President Trump called himself a nationalist at a rally for Senator Ted Cruz in taxes Lawrence O'Donnell on MSNBC said what Trump man is white nationalist I eat Nazi he\nKnows that in America of award nationalist usually follows the word white when Donald Trump uses that word he wants you to hear it as racist so that you will express your outrage at Donald Trump's racism and that will actually clarify\nHelp clarify for Donald Trump's followers the racists among Donald Trump's followers betting does really mean it as a racist message that in the style Trump's way of saying\nI Am a white nationalist\nSo Lawrence O'Donnell has favored to us with the real interpretation of the word nationalist because he knows better than the president himself what the president meant to say\nSo to reiterate how it works Trump says he's a nationalized Lawrence O'Donnell in his left wing counterparts condemn Trump Britain America First policy\nAnd that's a dog whistle to Trump's racist supporters that fear not their guy really is the racist they expect him to be see how that works [laughter]\nBut that was in the end of it of course here's the infamous grandstanding White House correspondent on CNN Jim Acosta in a statement to the president disguised as usual as a question and then his remarks later that day just all\nWas the CERN is your setting notice language for his job was to some of you out there that we really need is actually\nWhen you're demonizing immigrants migrants coming up from Central America trying to make their way to the United states and apply for asylum when you're demonizing middle Easterners and making the suggestion that they're they're terrorists and so on and that carbon without offering any proof and then calling yourself a nationalist in front of thousands and thousands of people\nI don't think it's a stretch for a lot of Americans out there to wonder whether or not the president is secretly considering himself a white nationalist\nSo of course are Costa and his fellow travelers in the very allegedly anti Trump media are taking it as an article of faith that all the people in that caravan or your as the driven snow but listen carefully to Jorge Ramos Univision\nFor most advocate for the rights of illegal immigrants as much as admitting that there are criminals in that caravan\nMight be in in the United states before so some of them yes helping deported majority not the vast majority of these people are not criminals they're not terrorists and they're not even immigrants that refugees we cannot prejudged him we can say all of them are are criminals\nDid you hear that some of them were deported by their countries not all of them are criminals\nThat's essentially proof positive that Trump is correct when he says there's bad people in that caravan and we'll talk about it more a bit later in the show\nNow since the alleged perpetrator of bomb gate seas or say a junior is a Republican and Democrats could now position Trump supporters and conservatives in general as just as crazy as them and a very revealing ad\nMissouri Senator Claire McCaskill who was in one of the tightest races in these midterms as much as ... minutes that the Democrats have gotten crazy\nI don't always agree with ground the cash for your car goes first times doing all those town hall afraid to stand up against her own party\nAnd Claire not one of those Democrats she works right in the middle on\nWell Republicans have fully exploited that craziness of the left and an ad laying out all the reasons not to vote Democrat\nFine with me er and death threats fire laughed moving to socialism mine defended open borders immediate tax increases one hundred percent government run health care to booming economy Nancy Pelosi back in power gridlock and\nA red wave as it's certainly here\nOkay well as you said that the Democrats have run on a massive joke\nBasically stopping Trump at every turn it almost nothing else though they've tried to make health care and issue which is ironic since it was their own Obamacare legislation that costs them massive numbers of seats all over the country over the last six years do you think\nWith Trump's latest approval number region forty seven percent according to NBC that they're rethinking that strategy and if so\nIs it too late to roll out an actual positive message\n[noise] yeah I think it's too late I think Democrats have just been supremely focused on going after Trump and essentially running on a platform of repealing and replacing so to speak you know everything he's accomplished I think\nThe Kavanaugh hearings really hurt the Democrat that link certainly shows that and with Trump's approval I think in that NBC poll that the highest approval Trump as ever had in the old which is pretty significant you know now we're less than two weeks out from the midterms\nYou know I think voters are basically going to say do we want more of the smear tactics from the Democrats the way they treated having all near them and you know you can compare that to the hot economy the tax cuts job\nI think both parties have really dug in and the message is pretty clear for voters\nAre gases Martin Walsh a national correspondent for liberty nation dot com now Martin one of the reasons the pollsters were so wrong two years ago is it there was obviously a hidden Trump vote for people who either lied to the pollsters about their preference or refuse to talk to pollsters\nDo you think this might be happening again\nYeah I think I mean I think a lot of people are hesitant to really speak with the media um I think they're largely afraid to be you know smeared or attacked or insult they don't want to be\nYou know challenge for our criticized for supporting the president and his policies I think that's definitely it was reflective in twenty sixteen I think that's why they got it so wrong and I think it's probably going to be another theme this election people just they are afraid to publicly show they support the president I think\nThere's a lot of examples of violence and smears ... tax that would really support that argument people just don't want to be attacked for their beliefs are conservative believes that is\nNow one\nOverwhelming upset of historic proportions like the one in two thousand sixteen when Trump beat the heavily favored Hillary Hillary Clinton does not a pattern may but if the Republicans defied the pollsters again this year\nIs it too strong a statement to say that Trump has forever changed how politics is done in this country\nIs probably fair to say he's he's changed things pretty dramatically I think time will tell how long it sticks\nBut I think he's really open the door for more outsiders\nThank you Martin [noise] yes thank you Marty Walsh of liberty nation dot com white break and then we're back to ask the question is\nHappens when that caravan reaches our southern\nLiberty
