{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "But he began unbeknownst to me the ... law during my commentary on the Bible the rational Bible and said I Hope it I think some things have effect I Hope it's okay with you or doesn't offend you in any way for me to say it is it is a great Christian work\nOf Bible commentary of scholarship\nAnd it was very sweet thing for him to say\nBut but I'm Jewish why would I be offended if a Christian were to say\nThat my commentary which is meant to be universal it's meant to be for Jews Christians atheists Buddhist Muslims agnostics every anybody\nIt's kind of makes sense to everybody or it doesn't make sense but why would I be offended for a Christian to say to great if that's the greatest compliment I can get from a Christian is it's a great Christian commentary\n\nBut see the pastor's being was being very sensitive and to his great credit but it is also a function of our time\nAnd the Megan Kelly situation while obviously very very different is related in my opinion we have become walkers on egg shells in our society\n\nIt is it is a wonderful thing I I have always tried to walk around with but why say anything that that offends this person and uh it's a monitor built into me\n\nBut every good things can go too far it's one thing not to gratuitously insults somebody and it's another to have to walk on eggshells with with members of every other group in your own\n\n... it's it it makes for ... natural relationships\n\nIf you can joke around and if you if you can't say what's on your mind it's that's not that's not an achievement against racism or anti Semitism or other forms of bigotry something the cheap and\nIt's it's a form of\n\nHyper sensitivity bordering on nonsense and an unnatural miss if I Can't talk to you a member of a different group than me\nNaturally when I mean no malice and that's key if I mean malice then it ends of the issue if you think I mean malice then don't listen\nThan I should be I should be extradited from your wife and I don't mean identity anybody\n\nBut if there isn't malice intended then then what is the ... ... what is the hyper sensitivity it's it just means I Can't talk to you naturally\n\nAnd that's what that's what the left because it's it always means of cause disease it's if they've got to be fighting some some new evil why they're micro aggressions because they acknowledge there's so little real racism in society they have to make it up\nOh you didn't mean it but you really are are you really are\nRacist so all it does is make it harder to talk men to women women to man well especially men to women 'cause ... you know you can insult the Mad Men are insulted constantly there on a daily basis\nMen or men or men or men or men are if you want to say women are then it's it's over\nNear a hater you were a big if you're ... or you could say men are till till the cows come home\n\nSo we're we're breathing on natural this is not this is not a an advance in relations between different groups it's it's a deterioration the issue is too\nAs I wrote in my column a couple of weeks ago that was there a lot of people seem to enjoy than they should I spoke of my time at the Rotary Club how a New America was exceptional in my in my mid twenties when I joined assuming Valley California Rotary Club\nWhen was the only Jew and the group and their their general reaction was so ... that's the way that's the beauty of the best reaction possible I wasn't put into some fine China where to be delicately\nDealt with\nIt was just yes he's a Jew and therefore what he's just he's another American who happens to be a Jew great who happens to be a black right what happens to be Native American great the weapons to be as panicked right that was the big age right happens to be that's the ideal\n\nSo we we uh [noise] because whatever the left touches of poisons it's poisoning relations between groups that get along otherwise great blacks and whites get along great in America\n\nBut the the the leftist doing everything possible to ensure that the people not get along great after all we all know this happier to block the happier the woman the happier the Hispanic\nHappier the gay they're more likely they are\nHappiness as the enemy of left his\n\nHands free\nAnd nine twenty the answer or here's the grapes selling point of relief factor

investigation what's likely\nTo come out of it or we will be speaking just moments from now with a Jim Fitzgerald who is one of the FBI supervisory special agent in a criminal profile or who else to crack the Unabomber case\nWhich ah it won't take as long I don't think to crack this case will speak to specialized and Fitzgerald retired are coming up on them that that show about that it's also a big day in the world of media uh I I Know that people often have an exaggerated idea\nOf what people immediate jobs make\nBut there is a figure in America and a media who has a three year sixty nine million dollar contract that's that's awfully good money and Megan Kelly I gone fired\nDropped by her talent agencies CIA and by NBC uh\nIt it it it of their NBC of saying well she may be just off not out she may collect all her money any way what is the conflict all about it's about oh about Fifteen seconds of TV Time\nWhat did she say does it deserve this response we will get to that and then a question about the caravan\nUh we we all hear from a left\nThat President Trump is terrible on the caravan and yes now a Secretary Mattis is sending eight hundred troops to the border of the president's request\nTo make sure that order is maintained and I know people are not just simply going to walk in from the caravan I that is of course the right position to take\nBut what's the Democratic position\nIs the position that literally anyone seeking asylum in the United states should be welcomed with open arms and should be allowed to come in if they are suffering there are a lot of suffering people in the world\nHow many do folks on the left actually wants to take care and then we have disagreement day of course a but first up I Am very very pleased because\nYou know it'd be it'd be so depressing the other way up President Trump is handling this bombing situation decently\nAs he handling it brilliantly in with unbelievable a plum and so much style and so inspiring no but it's it's it's better than adequate it's good it's fine\nI mentioned on the air yesterday it it might have been a nice thing and who knows maybe he did it just hasn't called attention to it\nTo call some of the people who have gotten these bomb packages send to them and say gee I feel bad we are going to try to track these people down and make sure you don't get any threats again they didn't call Joe by you can call Hillary Clinton you can call ... rock Obama\nWhy not is president the United states\nAnd uh he did get the tone I think pretty close to just right at the beginning of this rally last night Wisconsin a lot of people are saying oh what you're going to say in Wisconsin in federal court fact people in the media are freaking out is he's blaming the media for this whole thing he's not he is\nAnd they are distorting what the president said here is what he said the very beginning of his rally in Wisconsin of course all of this for the midterm elections which are coming up twelve days from today here's President Trump\nBegins his rally by addressing the suspicious devices and packages that were\nTo current and former high ranking government officials my highest duty as you know as president is to keep America\nSafe that's where we saw [noise]\nHas conducted an aggressive investigation and we will find those responsible and we will bring them to justice hopefully very quickly [noise]\nAny acts or threats\nOf political violence or attack on our democracy\nIs so [noise] no nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method\nPolitical ... co workers your or control we all know the search conduct verse three fiercely oppose and firmly prosecuted\nOkay this is entirely right\nWhat is the problem people have with this one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number\nA because it seems to me that the president that lets the cheers there from conservative I haven't heard a single conservatives say well you know what people who got these bombs uh deserved it\nA ... no one is anyone stood up to try to defend the mad bomber whoever this person is\nI don't think so certainly no one on the right if anyone on the left stood up to defend him or her I think it's probably a guy a ... ISIS as ISIS the vendors [laughter] the bomber and by the way it's not an ISIS flag it has now been carefully analyzed\nIt was the image was a parody of an ISIS flag\nThat are invoked a Larry the cable guy get her done but\nThat was the image which was a parody from an ISIS flag showing three scantily clad women in high heels okay I mean really\nReally [noise] [noise] okay\nIt's the president went on in opening his rallies speech last night to say this we\nAll sides\nTo come together in peace and harmony we can do and we can do\n[noise] more broadly\nThere's much we can do to bring our nation together for example\nEngaged in the political arena\nMust stop treating political opponents as being morally defective have\nCondemnation and destructive routine these are arguments and disagreements that have to stop no one should perilously compare\nTo historical villains which is done often\nSo all the time I got to stop we should not\nMob people\nIn public spaces or destroy public property [noise]\nOkay at by the way he he is completely correct I literally in the last twenty four hours there have been about a half dozen instances including very prominent one on CNN [noise]\nOf a lot of people calling comparing President Trump to Hitler and know\nThat is not appropriate and yes that is disgusting and it's inappropriate so the president is speaking well\nI I Know is reading from a teleprompter I Know it's prepared for him but that's what you want for goodness sakes this is a time where he has to be careful of his language and he was\nBut then he added this and this was the controversial part of his rallies speech last night and I think what he said was absolutely one hundred percent correct and highly defensible listen\nMedia also has a responsibility to a civil\nOr stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\n[noise] okay why is it not possible for people\nOh say on CNN or MSNBC or on CBS or any ... any of them to acknowledge that the president is right about this but instead of that we heard this from John King on CNN in response to the president's remarks\nNo one's blaming the president and the president\nOf but the president that wants to make this about him I'm a man to the president for what he first said yesterday\nIs take a breath everybody tone it down\nLet's just see where the fact that the investigators do their job we can all be better\nThen it's our fault why\nOkay she never said it was your fault the president's words where the media all the responsibility to set a civil tone and stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks\nA that are Republican was behind it because of course by default since all the devices are going to democratic either politicians a media sources or other people related to them an actor\nWith deniro that's the that's the message that being said\nThat you know we don't like your way of thinking we don't like your brand of politics so of course\nWho's going to Senate Republicans but it could be Michael I false flag type situation where it's actually like set up and make it look like\nIt's a bad guy on one side of the political aisle when actually get somebody on that same side who doesn't really want to hurt the people who are getting these devices because quite frankly none of them have detonated\nBut that up but they're getting their point across as look how bad this other side is so please\nVote for us in two weeks I Can't tell you Michael which one that it is but I work cases in the past not always bombs\nOr sometimes just letters and and then saying certain things that other political ah um incidence in another elections where\nOne side as there are people write to 'em you know the opponent by pretending they're on his er or get to the opponent pretending they're on his side sort of a mini fall sly type situation and let me just throw in here Michael the last thing\nSince we had ... outside source forces as in the Russians and some others a mess with the two thousands sixteen election or at least try to\nI can completely rule out any very simplistic and almost unsophisticated way that there is some parties such as that\nAre involved in this whole thing just to throw a wrench in the works of our upcoming election and just confused and confound the people involved and cause a little bit of may and quite\nFrankly I'm getting it makes America look bad and they I I and that's my uh my wife was a clinical psychologist is convinced that it's the Russians who knows we'll see but\nIdea is that this kind of thing and not only makes Republicans look bad because everyone's assuming as a Republican\nBut it makes our country look bad because uh if if you're having very prominent people whose safety is being threatened in this way by bombs that aren't even that well made it looks like a banana republic\nOr do you think it's likely that we will have a PRP or before the election of twelve days from now\n[noise] I I I lost one word on you there but I think if you set a resolution and the next twelve days\nOr so I sent a perp a perpetrator\nOh yeah okay same thing um\nI think there's a very good possibility I mean they there's a task force with at least a hundred people on it working this right now in multiple cities I Believe it's

that's not going to be possible\nAnd this particular case is one of those where I think that people who were treating this feeding her as a victim\nOr treating her as some kind of horrible criminal or both wrong or what Megan Kelly displayed in her interchange on NBC about black face and Halloween blackface uh costumes\nDoes not represent racism and it doesn't represent\nInnocent victim mode either it's just represents colossal monumental indescribable stupidity she's a lawyer\nShe's obviously a very bright and capable TV journalist and for goodness sake given the fact that she had just a couple of years ago a huge explosion of well deserve controversy for her insistence that Santa Claus was white\nAs she should have been able to watch out on this\nBecause what all of this is based on his she was commenting in a discussion about a Halloween masquerade which looked truly awful frankly uh by ... the lessons to his one of the real housewives of New York\nAnd um she um she dressed up as Diana Ross and pose and put out pictures of it\nAnd uh and and Diana Ross and of course has very um a light skin and as soon as she was trying to approximate that wearing a big giant afro wig and it looked awful and ugly and people were offended by it of course\nAnd a Megan ... took it upon herself in a conversation on air\nTo defend the idea of dressing up in blackface for Halloween a very very stupid point to make but here's what it sounded like\n[laughter] it's really you do get in trouble if you are a white person what's on the way or a black person it puts on white they\nLike that that that was

be able to take it okay Allen broker of course veteran a weatherman on NBC or was one of the many many many people demanding that Megan Kelly apologize and er here here's what al ... had to say\nBut the fact is a while she apologized to the stuff she knows a bigger apology\nTo folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the eating the berries minstrel shows the ... to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right when\nI'm old enough to live through Amos and Andy where he had white people and black and he's playing to black characters and it was a magnifying the worst barrier talks about black people and that's what the big problem is\nOkay yeah it is a big problem and by the way Megan Kelly saying when I was a kid it was okay to dress in black face she's forty seven years old\nIf she was a hundred and fifty years old maybe\nMaybe it was okay or or even if she was\nEight years old or Ninety but I've got to tell you I'm older than Megan Kelly I hate to admit it but I Am and uh when I was a little kid it was emphatically not okay if somebody had showed up at our Halloween carnival in my elementary school in San Diego California\nUh wearing black face costume for Halloween\nI think they would have been asked to go home is it has not been okay for\nA long time a long time\nAnd that's something that Megan Kelly as a graduate of the University of Syracuse in Albany law school and somebody who's been a TV journalists for a long long time honestly should've known her apology on air\nWas very carefully composed and it was meant to say for career obviously and it sounded like this\nI Want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nWe may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another\nBlack person making their faith later or white person making errors darker to make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it as it was a respectful and part of a Halloween costume it's old okay\nWell I was wrong and I and [noise]\nOne of the great heart Justinian is cherry\nGetting down\nAnd sometimes I listen [noise] yesterday I learned I learned that given the history of blackface been used in off always my country\nIt is not okay for that to be part of the\nOtherwise\nI'd never been a kind of person [noise]\nBut I Do understand the value in bull has it through our history particularly\nOn race and ethnicity this past year has been so painful for many people of color the country fails so divided and I\nNo wish to add to that pain and the fence I Believe is is it time for more understanding war love more sensitivity and honor and I want to be part of that\nThank you for listening and for helping me listen to [noise] [noise]\nUh well it didn't work she suspended or now it looks like uh\nShe uh she's not going to be on air on NBC and she's also dumped by CIA the talent agency major Hollywood talent agency that handles her\nSo she's done by both but she may be able to collect a what's left on her sixty nine\nHello Kevin\nWe don't have Kevin uh we will go to another call from Columbus Josh you're on the map that Joe\nHi Michael nice to talk to you great to talk to you [noise] um\nSo I originally called in to say why I'm voting for the first time in the midterm\nUh good out here and why\n[noise] well I think it's a way of expressing yourself all the yanks that people are saying and feeling right now like these the imported bomber or these pipe bombs you know I think part of it is ... and yes he is probably here she is probably a a dysfunctional person I'm Sorry I'm getting off track\nSo voting because I think when people that are in power\nOr you disagree with them you tend to to look and see what they're doing and be paying more attention and so I think that the best way to express my feelings are about the situation and my lot in life is to vote and voting on the local level and the state is the best way to do that\nNo good for you as one way or the other but\nThey're no good good for you I can I ask are you voting for ah Sherrod Brown or are you voting for congressman or when I see\nA ... at this point I haven't looked over their platform as let's let all the governor debates are that's far and I'll I'll be voting for Cordray for governor um\nUh that's interesting why\nUm I agree with issue one uh mostly um I I thought he did better in the debates I feel like the viewpoint wind up um it after that that that's how that's how I took away when I took away from it\nWell I knew it was fascinating as you know Ohio carry big time big league for President Trump he won Ohio by nine points\nAnd right now uh I Know the the governor's race as close a Sherrod Brown the very very liberal senator who really should be voted out but it looks like he is going to win and what this shows is the American people are not doctrinaire they're not automatic about their voting\nBut I I salute you Josh what you're saying about voting to express yourself to get involved\nIt's a good thing and it's the right thing and congratulations on that let's go quickly to David in Duluth a ... to ... uh okay we will go to David in Duluth, Georgia in just a moment\nAre coming up I Want to go to this idea [noise] of um [noise] this early voting and

disagreements day on the and I I mean I just said this disagreement day in on the Michael ... that show that means that is your day to\nDay [noise] [noise] that's\nRight fire away if you disagree with the points that I have taken or a physician that I have this five on this radio show this week or in the recent past [noise]\nOf the day is your day to set the record straight every single day on the Michael Mann that show [noise] we um we tend to privilege disagreeing halls but on disagreements day that's all we do [noise]\nAnd it can be not just on the topics that we discuss on the show today but it can be on any topic where we have a profound\nDisagreements for instance if you disagree about the appropriateness of President Trump describing himself as a national is I think it's fine\nIf you disagree with the warnings about ... about marijuana\nThat were expressed by Neal Pollack who's a guest on this show who almost did ruined his life he set by smoking marijuana if you disagree about Megan Kelly or about the a bomber and the likelihood of the\nOf the bomber having been inspired somehow or lead to this action by President Trump\nOr I Do not believe that is likely but uh we will see if you disagree with any of that or if you have a conspiracy you want to call to our attention because there is a full moon up there were not able to do a full conspiracy day\nBut we'll also broaden this on disagreement day on that show to count those are the words conspiracy just true believers one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number or you can reach us on Twitter\nAnd uh it's on Twitter is at ... show on Twitter that's at MIT that show\nUh let us go first to a couple of disagreeing a de de emails one comes in from ... in Los Angeles he says in regard to Megan Kelly I disagree with the uh\nUh with you telling me is Eddie Cantor a racist for putting on black face in singing many actually any ... better known for that another Jewish star the same era but Eddie Cantor may have put on black ice at times as many people did at the time\nAnd the other thing it sounds crazy that are racist would make himself up to look like a black person I Do not think that um like Megan Kelly as a racist I don't think she has a history of that I don't think she is someone who counts as a racist idle class fires that\nI Do think that things are very different today than they were in the Nineteen thirties\nOr the Nineteen twenties even ... and Eddie Cantor were popular or in ... and and part of what was difficult in those days is trying\nTo basically steel black musical forms by putting shoe polish or burn cork on your skin and in other words ... what the whole purpose of going into black face was so that you could sing black\nMusic and the idea being that you couldn't possibly sing it without the costume or performance\nAnd then this came in on the same subject from Jeff in Minnesota Jeff says regarding today's show Megan Kelly is inappropriate comment does this mean a black person cannot dress up as Charlie Brown\nBatman and Superman Wonder Woman Donald Trump et cetera at the same time a white person can dress up as Diana Ross prince a Black Panther Obama an American Indian et cetera can a male dress up as a female well\nObviously in fact a there are a lot of people think he should have a federal protections for that\nAnd a female is a male same thing a gender diversity at especially racism is dividing people of various appearances and more every day [noise] look I'm\n... I ... when you say can or can't ...\nCan do whatever you want it is a free country but there are consequences and right now there is a very different sense about a white person dressing up as a black person by putting black makeup on then it would be the other way around here would be one little point of advice\nI don't think anybody would mind if you just left off the skin makeup right if you wanted to dress up like a Bob Marley uh we had a caller who apparently\nDresses up as Bob Marley or you want to dress up as a Freddy Mercury Freddy Mercury was\nA Persian ancestry and yeah he had somewhat darker skin and okay so you want to dress up as for Freddie Mercury dress up as Freddie Mercury of the uh of queen\nBut don't put makeup on your skin because it is that the whole process of darkening your skin usually in a comical way because if you look at some of the classic black pays\nPerformers they don't look convincingly black it's not like Jimmy Kimmel Robert Downey junior and recent films are type TV shows were talking about\nIt's like a cartoon\nIt's a shoe polish it's it's it's black black not dark brown\nLet us go to your calls and to um Pete in shoreline Washington Pete you're on the man that show\nThat's or Michael are you doing I'm doing well outstanding um I agree with you that Megan Kelly may not have been the um [noise] she was not the poster child for conservative views but um she does have the right to say where she had to say is a First Amendment right um but\nYeah it's a and B as he has a risk Amendment rights Meyer I'm ...\n[noise] yes that's right you you you you have freedom of speech but you do not have freedom of consequences and look do I think that this whole thing is a little bit of an overreaction with Megan Kelly is passing comments I Do and I feel for her with that regard but she\nShe could have been quicker on this and certainly more effective it seems to me and responding to it let 'em go to a Brian in Schanberg Illinois Brian you're on the map that shows disagreement that\nAfternoon hey you luck to you a lot and you get away with a lot of slippery language and one of the one I'm calling about today is well you you're spots for a Mac he made the point that seniors are getting what they paid for which is not true they're getting a lot more than they paid for that Israel\nHas absolutely true and I do know that average\nFor every dollar a senior put put into Medicare they're going to be three dollars back okay\n... what I said I don't I don't believe that I had said that seniors are just getting back what they paid for I Am saying that they are are listed in a program and part of a program to which they've contributed for many many years and they have\nBut what you're saying oh by the way doesn't work for all seniors on every senior who gets back more than he pays for but particularly seniors who are lower income so they paid in less to the Medicare system are getting a lot more back that's true so I'm not sure where our disagreement is here\nYou seem to apply that you're only getting what you paid for but in reality I went on an average on average at every little bit right back a lot more than they paid in\nAnd on social wired and on Social Security as well which is one of the reasons and by the way do you know why they get back so much more\n[noise] because medical costs going so I\nKnow it's actually because our life expectancy keeps going up than in other words Social Security used to pay for itself because the life expectancy was sixty seven sale and to provide Social Security payments for people\nFor an average of two years and uh now our life expectancy is almost Seventy seven so it's very very different and much much more difficult to make the uh the numbers workout but your point is fair enough uh we\nWe all do get more back from both Social Security Medicare than we pay in but at least ... something and when people talk about Medicare for\nAll they're talking about people getting payments who put in nothing not anything at all let's go to a Steven born in Pennsylvania you're on the ... that show\nUp or down in New Jersey Michael Oh okay great um I I'm a white male drug being average old bones are the ones are the outlook andme irate that [noise]\nUm the boy that's an interesting conundrum I by the way I don't think the dressing up\nIn in the\nClothes are portraying somewhat of a different racial orientation herself orientation or anything is racist necessarily I'd be very careful the racist word\nI think it's stupid and it's also probably not a good idea I don't understand why someone would want to upset anyone with a Halloween\nCostume it's my wife loves Halloween [noise] but I think she would make the case is the whole point of Halloween is to bring joy enough to inspire controversy it as disagreements ... show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nBlack Americans are laughing at you and corporate America for this type of a thing about the black trade but I mean like people are not upset about the only people talking about this or individuals like yourself for example\nA NBC itself was using this black race thing to get out of her contract by like a professional basketball corporations using the N. word and things like that to get out of a contract amusing dog to get out of a\nA multi million dollar contract with Michael Vick for example a black people are tired or the\nOr and way way way way of a\nHold on hold on hold on for a moment do you think that uh that that they put Michael Vick in prison only because they wanted to get out of a contract\nAbsolutely there are no evidence that I mean let's go back oh come on anything let's go back\nTo the way he uh he's even acknowledge that he was guilty what he was charged with and he went to prison for I think almost two years maybe more than they were\nThere were there was no evidence there but I won't argue with you on gay but you're you're basically your basic point is look I'm listening to hire ... people are being used it is my ... my basic point by people like yourself\nWho how am I using black people here out how am I I'm not responsible for the next ...\nAs a professional to you you do that on a daily basis you\nOkay tell me how how\nYou use the energy of black people this thing is not a racist issue most\nPeople I agree with you and I've said that consistently but what I I you just made an accusation that I use the energy of about black people and so now misuse it wasn't the hell are you talking about\nFor example all people in the world have lack in them if you go by time study from years and years and years ago it demonstrates that the origin\nOf my face so therefore every over right I Am I I I understand and those genetic studies will show that I may well be every bit as black\nAs a Elizabeth Warren is Cherokee but go ahead\nSo so so why couldn't somewhat express themselves in a ... ...\nPeople can do is just do it and it's going to be counterproductive I don't think that it will dressing in a Halloween\nCostume and going in blackface means that you're a racist I Know people have done that\nAnd they're not racist but I think it's extraordinarily foolish to do it today and to try to defend it because there is such a thing as history\nAnd this is a an extremely depressing history on the bench Shapiro wrote a piece was was very good on this issue where he actually put up a clip\nFrom I'm In an old on musical comedy that showed\nWhat the black face really was like and looking at that reality in confronting that reality is part of our history and that seems to me it's worthwhile but people come to terms with it [noise]\nI mean while you can continue to come to terms
