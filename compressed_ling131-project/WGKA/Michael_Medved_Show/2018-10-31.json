ready to take on all of the big issues\nIncluding the question of birthright citizenship and is that a good issue for Republicans to focus on in these last days the campaign and why is that if the Democrats are supposed to be the party the down from the party of people who need help the party of the little guy\nWhy is it that the one area where they are counting on actually winning control of the house of representatives\nHas to do with the wealthiest suburbs in every state\nWhy is there suddenly a Republican problem with a will to do suburbs in this country one eight hundred nine five

polling\nThere are almost a dozen Senate races where the Republicans had a real chance\nOf a of making big inroads against various tablets Democrats now one of the Democrats or Republicans are very much hoping to knock off his Joe Donnelly of Indiana\nWho by the way is an idiot I mean this is not a bright capable member of the U.S Senate this is a guy who got elected because he was running against him very weak Republican candidate he's running behind all ready but then there was the debate\nLast night and a Joe Donnelly both in what he said and the way she later explained that stepped

knew Barbara Streisand years ago I actually worked\nWith her at one point and by the way she's a very nice person she is not a mean evil nasty person at all uh she has kind she's considerate and I think most people who have had any experience dealing with her on a personal basis I Will tell you that and it's sad for\nMe to see this and and I'll tell you why I I I Know that Barbara has serious aspirations as an artist\nBut somebody ought to tell her somebody ought to tell everybody on the left there's no lasting art there is no art of lasting value that has created for the politics of the moment\nDo is use\nOr do you okay honestly because it has a\nVery short shelf life or the campaign songs that various people right or not songs of people turned two years later\nAnd frankly you can think of things like blowing in the wind is blowing in the wind had a general political meaning but it wasn't specific like this aimed at one candidate or another\nAnd if you want to create music that really can do what music can do at best wishes to nourish the soul and maybe uplift the country wouldn't it be useful if the left would get off\nThis this is incredibly partisan one sided perspective to disaster an important question by the New York times of question was\nWhat do you say to those people who maybe your fans who may love you're singing may love your work\nBut also love Donald Trump for answers kind of astonishing and very sad we will get to that with your calls coming up\nI actually said that to George Bush okay and she also talked about she had a nice conversation with Bob Dole but the point is when she says it doesn't matter about offending Trump\nFans and he ... and then asked can you think of anything good Trump has done anything\nAnd then says a very long pause and then she says I mean this is a man who's kind of not kind of he's just mean I worry about the children I worry about what is the image ease projecting to them\nAnd then later in the interview she thought of something he'd done well and she said what he's done well you've asked me what I think he's good at he's good at marketing\nThen later she she says in the interview she blames Donald Trump or making her fat\nI'm not joking\nThe or the interview concludes with ... asking Barbara how are you feeling these days and she says I Want to sleep nights if we take the house I'll be able to sleep a little bit better\nAnd then Maggie versus if they don't don't know I've been thinking about do I want to move to Canada\nI think she'd promise to move to Canada before if Trump won the election I mean the presidential election and then she says I don't know if I Move to Canada I'm just so saddened by this thing happening in my country it's making me fat\nI hear what he said now and I have to go eat pancakes now and pancakes are very fattening we make them with healthy flower though I'm and flour coconut flower okay good for her ... does anyone think it's fair to blame Donald Trump for making you\nFat and that's what she said ah\nLet's go to Jeff in Seattle Jeff you're on the Michael ...\nMichael ... the the whole ... and going out with Trump saying you know fake news is evil or why are they the new people in the left is missing opportunity where for trying to trying to put a face to the people who exactly are the lawyers who is the big news is that\nLike Lawrence O'Donnell is if people on Rachel Maddow that John Lennon is that the guys was you know you see is that uh [noise] all of people you know they need they need a fortune to name these people who faces line\nHe he won't he won't because frankly he doesn't watch fake nose as he sees that he ... and you've heard the stories about how we only allows Fox News on air force one inning apparently got into a bit of a tiff with millennia because he called her watching CNN a\nQuarter to quarter you Don and when I watch all of them you know listen to try and was a little bits and pieces of all of them but good dog women you know he says that dog he watches his show but the my issue is is they need to try and force him to say who are these people who these people can come out and say I you know who is\nThe ... again I I I'll tell you I think you actually I understand what you're saying and I I Do believe that President Trump would gain\nA lot by inviting some of the people who have been most critical to him\nBecoming a White House sit down and talk it out it's a it it actually would makes you look so different but but the polarization are and to the extent that President participates in it I I think

[noise]\n[noise]\nHead on the Michael ... are talking about are the latest album by\nBarbra Streisand and about her comments in her in her interview uh that she doesn't care about what Trump supporters feelings you know the Trump fans of Barbra Streisand that might also be trumps borders the whole thing is too bad and it's an example\nOf everything that's wrong about this moment of polarization the I'm Megan ... stress in an interview have you ever met Trump and she says no\nBut when I was editing my last TV special for Netflix and we were looking at audience shots there he was sitting next to Barbara Walters but he never came backstage to see me or meet me so I've never met him\nI keep a President Trump takes the bait invite her to the White House disarm\nShe she writes she speaks in this interview very movingly about Bob Dole she said the most terrible things about bombs on when he was running for president she speaks very warmly about McCain now that he's gone um she said awful things about McCain when he was running against a\nBronco bomber but seat honestly let's face to face with people and I've never met Trump but I have heard from people who know him that he is actually a very different\nKinder person in person than you would think and\nThere's there's no reason to allow this this kind of insanity to continue it in her new album the album is called walls and I'm Maggie Haberman writes Barbara Streisand his new album one that is the musical and bought him into her singular disliked of President Trump boy I Want to buy that\nThe constitution of the United states in the fourteenth amendment which was adopted Nineteen sixty eight\nSays all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and other state we're in they reside\nAnd here's a basic alert people say on the other side they say well but it says subject to the jurisdiction there of the reason they included that is they wanted to exclude the children of ambassadors people who had a clear affiliation with a another country\nAnd ... by by that context I think that they could say that someone who is growing up as a citizen of another country or somebody who is left the United states and live the rest of his life in\nSomewhere else okay you exclude that person but to try to go after now people whose parents were not us citizens of the United states are not here legally the undocumented\nIs clearly a loser and there's a great great editorial today in the wall Street Journal making that point that the real point about this is that there is neither\nPolitical will no judicial will to do this or to have a constitutional amendment to change birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump is on very strong ground when it comes to resisting the caravan very strong ground\nAnd virtually all Republicans in nearly all Americans agree with that nobody wants to throw the doors open to everybody nobody wants to remove borders I shouldn't say nobody but very very few and just a fringe of the Democratic party\nAnd to stand on that principle the idea that we have to have an immigration system that works that's the kind of thing you can win\nThe or by the way they they just some fake news today on CNN or they said that well in in order to change the constitution the president would have to get two thirds of both houses of Congress and two thirds of the states that's not true\nHe would need to get two thirds of the house two thirds of the Senate and three quarters of the states it is not possible birthright citizenship is not going to\nChange I'm\nMr Trump wants to end the practice as the wall Street Journal and again nothing new York Times Wall Street journal which had been very supportive of President Trump's generally because Mr Trump wants to end the practice sometimes called birth tourism\nHe can always draft and campaign for a constitutional amendment but Congress is unlikely to agree and pass a law much less than an amendment to the constitution\nTo is making this futile gesture of an executive order a week before election day Mr Trump made a political mistake this year by not treating legal status to adult immigrants brought here illegally as children for more border security\nThen Republicans go to run on an immigration accomplishment and steady one of the political issue and will ... will soon see how well that worked but here's my basic point about this politically I don't think there's anyone who was excited by President Trump saying he's going to address\nBirth tourism who wasn't already supporting President Trump who wasn't already supporting a Republican and getting people excited over this by the way I Do think it would be possible to curb birth tourism\nBy enacting some legislation around it saying that in special circumstances where people are traveling to the United states not for the purpose of long term residency but simply to give birth to a child here in the United states then you can question whether that child really is in the jurisdiction\nOf the United states and that's okay\nBut generally to challenge the idea that a child born to someone who has lived here for\nTen years and where the child grows up entirely in the United states you want to try to challenge the citizenship status of that individual\nWhy not make more citizens who are actually committed to this country\nAnd so make sure that there is some kind of commitment or naturalization if need be but uh if there is any down for the parents but creating a process where people can go through American innovation\nIt seems to me is much better than obliterate in the idea of citizenship as some Democrats seem to want to do or the\nIdea of changing the constitution to change the status of people who were born here whose parents may not have had the right to come here and the first place and we'll be right back on the ... show or go to some of your

great American holiday today is Halloween which apparently now second to thanks giving second to Christmas by the way ahead of Thanksgiving\nIs the holiday inn which Americans invest the most money set a good thing or a bad thing uh we are spending they say seven billion dollars that comes about eighty bucks per household for\nHalloween decorations and candy and\nCostumes or we have a tradition on this show and every year it seems to take a different turn the tradition is a um a sort of a core disagreement that my wife and I have a learn to live with\nMy wife Dr Diane med vet is the author of seven books most recently her very important books don't divorce\nWhich I it is not required when we talk about Halloween but um as is is still good reading for Americans across the country or die thank you for joining us I don't know what is is a twentieth a Halloween debate\nYes at least I'm sure we've had that many\nOf you but there's a difference to it this year because there's so many universities Princeton University just issued a statement for students who was Yale a couple of years ago about the Halloween costumes that were acceptable or unacceptable\nOr do you think that um this concern with a cultural appropriation and political correctness regarding Halloween costumes reflect on some of the essential joy of the holiday\n[laughter] flex some of the central though I\nKnow how cultural appropriation fad is just a reflection of our over sensitivities in many areas that we shouldn't go out of our way to insult someone shouldn't\nDress up in a way that it's going to inflame the hatred or or do anything negative in the culture but on the other hand I I don't think that there needs to be declaration some restrictions issue ...\nAbout what students can do when they are celebrating on their own time\nOkay let let me ask you there was a story about a guy who came to a costume contests that of Mississippi bar in clarion Mississippi and he chose to do as a wearing traditional Ku Klux Klan garb\nAnd he was asked to leave and he was like permanently banned uh from that bar\nOr because it costs clan of course was involved in mass murder and um and the tax and repression and racism in the ass appropriate that he should be banned from the bar\nWell I think that every business owner has a right to decide what kinds of activities go on in the capital shrimp and you know that owner was that the absolute which said and I think\nThat it was very poor taste or coming to dress up as a cook Lex cleaner than it is offensive to many many people I mean I don't have a problem with a an an individual owners are saying this is not appropriate here\nYeah I think it's by the way who Klux Klan cost and would be offensive not very many be offensive to everybody\nEverybody yeah I feel like we don't like that yeah I can see that\nAnd what about the um there was a gentleman and he he posted it a very prominently on Facebook and in fact his wife's Facebook profile a profile has her husband dressed up in his Halloween costume which is a very realistic cost him as an SS officer or an officer of ah\nOf ah the ah the basically the shock troops this storm troopers for adults Hitler and then they had their five year old dressed up as adults Hitler or they um actually have now tried to apologize uh yeah they didn't hire\nIf that was in Kentucky yeah I I Know and I think that is inappropriate especially get than a guy I mean it's like no you\nDon't do that right there was a rabbi in nearby Evansville, Indiana who said the rule of thumb is don't dress up for Halloween um in in a way that in in any way of votes the memory of people who actually murdered millions of people um okay so\nThat is that what Halloween is for most everybody I mean come on you're cutting out the exception the ones who are the bad boys of the holiday but\nThere are millions of people who enjoy it and he'll have a great time and quick truth benign costumes and to have time to meet their neighbors and get together and and share some fighter and candy corn so it's not not the way you're portraying it\nOkay I Know the people who sometimes and and let me make clear that traditionally I'm I'm not a big fan of Halloween I Would if a left my own devices pretty much ignore the holiday\nMy wife for whatever reason likes it and I know you like it because like you're going to go out trick or treating later with our granddaughter and I will admit that sounds perfectly nice and benign but what if she can't do that scare her what is it I don't know what she's dressing as what you're wearing\nShoes dressing up as a lady buck\nOh call that one I'm going to be was that the yeah the species\nAppropriation\n[laughter] what she does ... ... fine so maybe she has tried to copy become a a lady bugs but uh I don't think that when it's offensive\nOkay and I I can understand that for a two year old this'll be pretty interesting seeing people wearing all these different costumes but\nWhat about the emphasis of uh on blood Gore um the the dark side of the supernatural or do you think that's a a wholesome ingredient to inject into our cultural bloodstream every year with the sports has\nLed a wouldn't look I'm not in favor personally I Do see a lot of our neighbors making mock graveyard on their front lawns and hanging out skeletons and that and having goes\nCan do on their head jury um I you know I think that they're not doing that you scare anyone I think they're doing because so very clear that these are not real it's very clear that is their decorations for a holiday that lets you bet that there's death admits that there is\nA scary side to the the season changing into a dark and coal time of year and I don't think that that's negative for the people doing it they are doing it because I consider it turn and I don't think it it's hurtful to kids to see that\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number if you are a great fan of the Halloween holiday\nOr a non fan of the Halloween holiday or you can join us in this exchange a one eight hundred nine five on Seventeen Seventy six or you can send us a tweet at a it's an md bed show on Twitter\nUm it it it does this Halloween coming right after the arrest of this bombing suspect and right after the the truly truly horrible events in Pittsburgh and it was just four days ago\nOr does it feel a little bit different I mean again with all the answers on graves and and funerals and skeletons I I I when I Walk in our neighbor and I know exactly where you're talking about sweetie I mean there's a skeleton hanging from the tree\nI'm I don't see anything positive in that what's what's why is that a a a sort of a benign or worthwhile influence\nBut I wouldn't say that it wasn't that worthwhile influence I think it's an expression of a holiday and universally understood to be secular can be fun to be different from the rest of the holidays which are more I'm upbeat\nAnd I don't think that it's meant to give the neighbors a negative message at all and and I don't think it's injecting it into the culture I think the cultures embraced Halloween and sales for the holiday have increased every year because of the fact that it's an escape\nIt keeps it takes us out of the horrors that grace the newspaper front page it let that go into the world a fantasy and less as\nI Do think that are fun like bobbing for apples I mean there are things that happened on Halloween that or see how they remind us and the harvest remind this time of year and that's a positive of the holiday\nOkay what's the last time you have seen a what people would call inappropriate movie ... scary movie\nYou're asking me I don't go to scaring\nThe reason why I'm asking you negative known you the last thirty five years you know like\nScary movies that are about other topics too you know this is spent and slaps that attract considered pretty scary and violence in nearly every movie the only ones that I go to a rom coms\nI I understand but since you were so particular about movies I mean it's kind of\nHow it is not a celebration of scary stuff how Halloween the celebration where kids go out in the neighborhood and they see each other all dressed up and make but face paint on and they can put out a bag and say trick\nOr treat aged paying homeowners willing willingly overturned on their way way way Spain had the candy\nFace paint you're you're not making a case for black face costumes are you\n[laughter] know and making Kelly wouldn't either I don't think at this point\nYeah maybe maybe someone can go as Megan Kelly this year with um\nI was thinking about that first time that I I trick or treat it and our new neighborhood well most of the north west I dressed up as a clown and I met our neighbors and fill a multi colored hair and clown makeup\nAnd well and then I had a camera clown\nOkay well I I I certainly hope not oh we're speaking with Dr Diane ... clinical psychologist and best selling author and also um my wife for these last thirty three years going on thirty for all we will be right back
