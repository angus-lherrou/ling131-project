H.\nUh [noise] isn't such a great national holiday we are in the midst of bitter debate about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate in terms of Halloween costumes but can we agree\nThat this Halloween in particular it's not appropriate\nTo dress as an SS officer entered the rest of your five year old son his hat off\nEyes that just a an attempt at humor [noise]\nWe will get to the um\nThe the very relevant story\nOf a Nazi Halloween are coming up it is hard to believe the president is due to land in Pittsburgh and\nA short while to help anticipate his visit I Will be speaking with Lou Weiss who wrote a terrific piece in the wall Street Journal yesterday he's the father of New York times writer Barry White or he is a long time member\nWas a long time member of the tree of life synagogue which was struck by the terrorist attack\nWhat does he think of the president of the United states\nAre coming to visit Pittsburg at a time when there are some folks including the mayor who is not Jewish by the way the mayor of Pittsburgh saying uh know may be the president should not visit there\nA one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nOf air is so much going on in this country right now to drive us apart\nAt a time when we really ought to be trying to come together\nAnd I think that some of what is driving us apart is naked and\nSheep and rather ineffective politics on all sides and\n[noise] to strange strange situation because at the same time that I think many many people feel frustrated with both sides of the political debate at the moment\nThere's evidence everywhere that the amount of interest in participation impassioned with this election is just rising and surging and may in fact set records\nAre there are elements of a recent stories that show obviously some of the worst in our country but there are also some stories that show the very best in one of those stories as it struck me and I'd like to begin with is before we talk\nTo a ... from Pittsburgh it's another story about Pittsburgh and about the way that this entire nightmarish attack was handled which is very very much to the credit of some of the participants ah there is a I'm a doctor\nWho's the doctor in chief and in charge of a hospital to which the killer\nWho is now being arraigned these has twenty nine charges against him yes he faces the death penalty and I think that's appropriate the um the\nDoctor in charge of the hospital introduced himself to Robert ... hours after he has brought in wounded and treated in the hospital and uh he had um a a a a very brief word that he delivered when he went in to look at the killer\nAfter he'd been treated here's what he told him he said uh I Am Dr Cohen\nAnd this after the killer had been brought into the hospital or screaming or I Want to kill all Jews I Want to kill all the Jews here here is that Dr Cohen his name is Jeffrey Cohen he is the president of the Allegheny General Hospital where some of the victims\nAnd the killer were treated as he says he when he came into the room\nWith a killer there he asked me who I was I said I'm Dr Cohen president of the hospital and I turned around and left and the FBI agent that was guarding him said I don't know that I could have done that here's what Dr Jeffrey Cohen had to say\n[noise] so um [noise] I've been invited ...\nCouple of weeks ago\nMy inclination was I had to get back to normal life so I went to this\nI talked to the nurse that took care of him before I went down to the game\nAnd you know I wrote down his years is uh what all those men saw\nI went to the game and came back but I went to see the shooter and the cops and was already\nTo try to understand why did you do this\nI have no answers I asked them ... and he was sort of ... said going okay but I produce or sell stocks going ... general\nThat are left the FBI agent in charge will diminish those\nAre you ...\n... leaders believe all the chaos is going on the gentleman didn't appear to be a\nIt was just so the noise here's the noise\nNoise for soldiers were being slaughtered thought it was hard to rise up and do something we would consider the worst things things that we\nWere leaving ... doing things like that so far to the\nAnd okay I'm at that as a balanced inappropriate statement\nThere are too many harsh and ridiculous words some of them by the way many of them on the left we will get to that Dr Cohen a continued his comments he had this to say\nWhere one very simple mission trip alligators this will take care of sick people we don't air forces who they are will ask questions about virtuoso so what do they pay ... patients that makes a very simple for\nOur staff to do the right job so\nI Will tell you that I'm very proud of them cause they did a great job you have to develop a visitor ironic\nSomebody who is yelling at me every once in a hospital I Want to kill all the Jews taking care of by George Bush ... Jewish hospital president\nAnd there was also the attending emergency room doctor who cared for the killer was also Jewish nurse who cared for his father is a rabbi and um\n[noise] ... Cohen and says Dr Cohn and we just heard from is personally connected to the shooting beyond his role at the hospital he live so close to a tree of life synagogue\nThat on Saturday morning he heard the gunshots as the massacre unfolded he knew nine of the people who were killed nine of the eleven\nThat didn't stop him from going in to check on Bowers look this is America\nAnd it really is and I I was reminded of something it's not nearly so dramatic because it doesn't involve killing and shooting and horror\nButton involves part of the beautiful part\nAbout the United states of America years ago I did a book called hospital which actually was one of the most successful books I've I've done it was a big bestseller\nAnd uh it was about some of the pressures that physicians encounter and some of the problems that ... and counter dealing with those pressures that was a profile of thirty real life medical professionals\nAnd uh when I was doing the book I I went to Pittsburgh and I was doing a TV show and I was I'm told I was going to be on the show\nWith a um a a leading expert on substance abuse who were treated a lot of doctors who would come to substance abuse so I come to the TV studio\nAnd uh there is a husk Hasidic rabbi who was sitting there and um I introduced myself\nAnd he says oh I'm I'm Dr ... and and he is uh Hasidic rabbi any is also one of the world's leading experts on substance abuse and he is in charge of psychiatry\nAt St Francis hospital a Catholic hospital he graduated from Marquette University a Catholic university he's always been Jewish she's from a prominent Hasidic dynasty I was floored because I Know is rabbi where see from his work he's written one of the best Bible commentaries I've ever read period it's called live every day\nAnd [noise]\nAnd again there's something about that there's something about the story and it it actually move me to tears of today the\nLocal Muslim association in Pittsburgh has announced they raised a hundred and Ninety thousand dollars to help the people a tree of life congregation at the service that they held in Pittsburgh on Sunday after the shooting the a\nMuslim leaders of the community were very prominently involved and given some of the harshness between Jews and the state of Israel and and Muslims around the world this is a beautiful thing and it does a great tribute to the United states of America\nI think it's also a great tribute to the United states of America that um many people most people are going to welcome the president of the United states respectfully\nHopefully he'll be wherever he goes I mean how betrayed it that way and I think it's just the politics one way or the other I think it's just a\n'cause um it's awesome it's unfortunate and I think it's a bit of regret\nAnd it is and and again ... out of respect for the losses that the families feel I uh I just read a then apparently the sixty six year old physician I I forget his name\nJerry yeah he who you know you know\nCare about what's not I'm not a new look it's crazy I knew him he we haven't\nI have multiple sclerosis and there's a spike team rights under my name it he writes with all the people in our group I said Jerry you're riding with our group ... put on a shirt be part of our group now I'm I like to go down alone I'm Alone person then uh [noise] so anyway\nHe was he was apparently safe from the initial response but he rushed into ... line of fire because as a physician he was trying to help people who were wounded or something\nToday that he this this is the most well some of the ... he doesn't have any kids or what ever anyone in the community would die he would say cottage for them\nBecause he didn't have anyone to say cash for him but I Know that every Jew in the city of Pittsburgh and every Jew around the world is shipped back we'll be getting up and saying ... ...\nA memorial or and and honor the departed you let me let me pick up something in in some of the little time we have left ... one of the things that struck me about your column you would reference\nThe portion of the ... the Jews everywhere around the world in Pittsburgh and in Seattle and in Tel Aviv and income undo every Jewish congregation was reading the same story of Abraham bargaining with God to try to save the citizens of Saddam and a very great ran by the last generation whose name you know rabbi Moshe\nFeinstein asked a question about what and he asked the question why is ... why is Abraham are concerned about these evil people the citizens of Saddam why is the bargaining and there'll be have\nA drive to save the whole city for the sake of a few righteous people and the answer that he gives he says look when it says love your neighbor as yourself\nIt's easy to love people share your values it's easy to people who agree with you what's hard is finding loving your hard for people who are completely opposite of you and that was what Abraham was doing a\nI read something I read was rabbi fact I'm not sure but he said only by acknowledging the humanity of the ... or do we acknowledge it in ourselves and you said it right I mean I see it all up man kind of it's very hard to love your neighbor especially if you're near my neighbor I'm just\nKidding [laughter] ah listen it's what what what do you plan to contribute to all of this is in so profoundly important and\nAnd again and I hope that the rest of the country can actually benefit from Pittsburgh to example and to be stronger I I didn't know that the Steelers actually showed up at the funerals uh today and\n... and again that's that's a beautiful thing and uh maybe maybe in merits of the departed um ... we can\nCan all do better and in terms of this sphere of community larger community for our country or we

and the other part of the country in the northwest\nWhich was I Hope and assume the president is traveling with is Jewish daughter and his ah his Jewish son in law both of them are religious and Jewish and because again with all of the attempts\nBy various people to make political hay out of this tragedy that the president is going to be honoring today by doing the right thing and going to

not doing you know he's doing the right thing\nAnd now let's hope that he does it no right way and it would certainly be appropriate if he got up and it introduced a\nMaybe his daughter and son in law

Florida when the race which I think is a shame because I wanted very much to see Ron descent as the Republican win that race but it's wrong for the president to call the mayor of Tallahassee a stone cold these um\nAny ages did that I I think the\nMayor Gillum of Tallahassee is morally compromised ethically compromise I think he has a lot of problems\nBut this is the president of the United states you can't use that language Mr President but certainly certainly Howard Dean to say the president of the United states is evil\nDo you think it's appropriate for a former Democratic national chair to use those terms one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise] this is one of the problems is we have just had a demonstration of evil\nAnd there have been three cases very prominent cases one not as prominent as the other two\nBut it should be in which really evil was displayed\nThis a killing is a double killings a homicide in Louisville and they have apprehended the perpetrator and in lieu of all there was a guy who tried on Sunday to get into a Baptist church a black Baptist church was stopped the door was locked he was armed\nHe apparently had it in mind to kill some black people and then he found two people at random track them down or killed a a one one African American shoppers sixty nine in front of his grandchild put the gun at the back of the guys had assassinated him\nAnd then he called a black woman in the parking lot\nAnd this was a guy who was just mouthing off about the N word and ah and by the way it has a history of violence in the history of psychotic behavior formerly married to an African American who you'd also abused by beating her and using the N word with her\nUm this is a real problem this is a very real problem\nAnd it's a real problem when you have somebody who sends out\nBombs to Fifteen people none of whom are criminals none of 'em are evil\nBut you see this is the problem it is evil to try to blow somebody up because you disagree with them politically it is not evil to disagree with them politically sure you can express contempt\nOr you can express dislike for George Soros or for Brock Obama or for Hillary Clinton\nThere lots and lots of people who dislike them but when you use the term evil it puts it in a different category and it's simply is wrong\nAnd what Howard Dean is doing here is wrong it's also deeply wrong with Don Lemon did a Don Lemon\nOn CNN had\nThis to say about the biggest terrorist threat our country faces\nI keep trying to point out people not to demonize any one group or any one ethnicity but we keep thinking that the biggest terrified of something else some some some people who are marching towards the border like sending a so we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest fear for in this\nCountry is white men most of them radicalized brought up to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no ban on you have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so when we do about that\nIs he suggesting we should have a white guy ban what would you ban white guys from doing how about the white guys who work with the with CNN are they okay I\nI mean should there be no mixed dancing between white guys and other guys are\nI I mean what what is going on this is this is completely completely weird\nAnd crazy and unacceptable\nA let us go to Deborah in Brooklyn New York Deborah you're on the Michael Mann that Joe\nHi Michael how are you today I'm very well uh\nI Love listening to your show I find your voice very soothing it's like therapy\nOh well good\nThat's my wife was a professional therapist though but go ahead\nYou go I ah I was a Republican uh up until now Donald Trump came along and I'm now an independent it's ah I I I like when you are the things you say you call it like it is I could just ... but then there's always a bike\nAnd I want to know why there's always a but he is what he is he says what he says it seems like we say oh okay that's just Donald Trump them again so why can't they say he's evil and we why we are so what\nDo what do you use do you think he's evil\nYes I have an evil is a strong word you know the parts and I will say that things he says how we say\nWell wait they'll ... they'll have two different things there are two different things Deborah and this this goes to the heart of your challenge and I it's a great challenge I I think there are things that he says that are outrageous\nBut speech ... in in and of itself to coal speech evil if if\nYou are saying I order you to go out there and murder these people yes that's evil but to make some stupid remark and and Trump makes a stupid embarrassing remark virtually every day I mean it's\nIt and it's it's tedious after a while because when you talk about what he does what he has achieved as president you recognize as a former Republican Deborah don't you that he's had some successes as president\nYou know what yeah yeah yeah way or the way he doesn't articulate exotic clear eyed alec when there's nothing about and that is a leader in my mind that the president of the United states but it all it all again everything he does that good because he he acts like such a oh\nOh okay what would you hold on hold on for a moment of ... bronco Obama was extremely eloquent\nHe was almost always dignified um he spoke very well and I think he did a terrible job as president\nAs President Trump makes fun of himself frequent lately he has he has not eloquent or he is also an overload and and childish and all those things and but not his record on appointing judges his record even on foreign policy is record certainly on Middle East policy\nAnd ... you know the the normal American person whether they're white black they're under a lot of culture shock I call it a lot of stress in the nineties we add diversity visas and we've short corporate landscape change and when I was at age in the illusion\nYou know the American was the minority a lot of times the American lost their job they ship than somebody and and and this has nothing to do with the synagogue shooting but I'm just saying a lot of people are angry people have to understand that there's two angry group shares that just the minorities and the blacks\nI mean the women regular average person white what have you and it's been going on for for too long\nI look I agree with you I think there's too much anger in the United states so what are you saying should be done about it\nI don't think the founding fathers said beware of the factions here very smart either the constitution and he pout should not be practicing identity politics and showing them and we're working with these groups everybody's supposed to be equal you don't get them positive rights is this is what starting all the problems\nWell the the point is you don't give people ... you get people's rights based upon their status as citizens of the United states not upon special status of a citizen of a certain ethnicity or certain\nHeritage and I think you're entirely correct It's one of the reasons that one of the most toxic ideas which by the way it seems that the Democrats have largely ... dropped is this notion of reparations\nAnd I am glad that's gone away appreciate your call let's go to a Joe in Los Angeles Joe you're on the Michael ...\nMichael how are

synagogue that was attacked by an evil evil gunmen who of course now is in custody\nThe president's also accompanied by his daughter Ivanka and his son in law Jared Kushner uh both of whom live their lives as religious Jews\nAnd [noise] what is so sad and honestly it makes me kind of a bill\nThat virtually everything this president does including things that are fine that are normal\nThat aren't necessarily brilliant are deep bore profound but they're just normal president things ever everything is going to be controversial and I I I just anticipate this controversy coming across I have to give you a little bit of a visual description of what happened here\nIn front of the synagogue and the squirrel hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh\nThey've set up a series of memorials two of the fallen to to the eleven people were killed were murdered in that synagogue and people abroad flowers and and by the way president from a\nAnd I think probably through the influence of his daughter or maybe through his staff or a son in law who knows he knew that the Jewish tradition is that in in Judaism when you go to a\nTo honor someone at at a at a grave side um you you leave a a Little Rock a pebble I'm a sometimes it can be a larger stone but it's it's the idea that it's not something to say just on the stays there\nAnd the idea that um there's a phrase in Yiddish that that means that the the dead don't smell the flowers\nSo basically that's a sign of morning and the president and the first lady and Avon and Jarrett all brought they had a tray of of stones I Believe that secretary of the nation\nWho is also a Jewish insects their treasury who is with them [noise] okay so here's here's what I Am anticipating and honestly this is a case where I Hope I'm wrong\nOr\nThe series of Jewish stars six point and stars stars and David it's referred to as the ... the the shield of David and okay that those stars have been set up in honor of the fallen here\nBut they have been put in front of what is obviously crosses a that you would have on a temporary grave side\nSo what the president is seeing as he's seeing a Jewish star but behind that Jewish stars across\nSome idiot and it's not going to bring up a an element of controversy because what it shows is the president of the United states and the first lady very respectfully\nAnd some really are leaving their rocks on the cross ours with across behind the star of David\nDo I find it offensive that they used process to set up this temporary memorial this is not at the graveyard this is that the synagogue itself where the killings took place\nI think it's fine uh let let me also say I think it's it's a shame that a controversy has erupted\nOver a campaign stop in Michigan that I'm an advice vice president Pence was involved with an and here's the background of the story and I'll do it very quickly\nBecause we have some outrageous material to get to that that really does need attention but what happened was the vice president was he was campaigning for a a fine candidate named Lena Epstein\nWho is running in a a contested hotly contested congressional race to become a the first Jewish Republican woman in\nHouse of representatives and that would be a good thing they wanted because the vice president was making campaign appearance to have somebody say some kind of\nA memorial prayer on behalf of the people who fell in Pittsburgh and that's also very appropriate what wasn't so appropriate is Lena Epstein for reasons that are completely unclear a lean\nI've seen as a member of a Jewish congregations she's fairly active she is proudly unapologetically Jewish\nBut she apparently selected um [noise] to deliver this prayer a a a Christian um who actually went to a Baptist\nSeminary and now styles himself rabbi and he was there wearing a prayer shawl and he said this\nPrayer in the name of a of Jesus and no it's not a good thing it it it just isn't\nBecause of the people who died were not Christians they were not Jewish Christians they were Jewish Jewish were members conservative Jewish congregations and this is not a controversy that the vice president needs or the administration needs or anybody needs right now\nAnd uh does that mean that Lena Epstein should not be elected to Congress of course he should be elected to Congress but it means that if if we're going to be serious about trying to build a broader base of support for this administration\nThere could have been much more care without one now meanwhile the protestors who were trying to disrupt the president's visit to um to Pittsburgh\n... it's just awful and and\nUh uh demonstrators said Trump is fanned the flames of hating us partially responsible for this tragedy and his only making things worse by coming housing\nMaking things worse and once you have to do with this tragedy the the person the killer Robert Bowers hated from because he felt Trump was to surrounded by Jews\nAnother protester named Suzanne suffered\nA said the president's a visit is not something that people here want\nHe has promoted more negativity than he has support and solidarity he's fostered an administration of white supremacy and he is not welcome here in our time of morning said one of the organizers I'm of the protest I look\nThis is this is all crazy and wrong\nThere was a um a comment on uh\nThe the buzzfeed from one of the protesters who is they're trying to say to the president not to get off the plane in Pittsburgh and the protesters said uh\nI'm here to honor the eleven people who are lost a hatred and to send a message to Trump was fanned the flames of hey this partially responsible for this tragedy see if they repeated enough it becomes kind of a reality in people's\nMinds and that is is wrong and it's despicable and it it leads to to craziness\nAn ... it it truly does I mean if someone wants to explain to me how Trump is responsible for this tragedy by a classic in his mind and\nAnd somebody who was so anti Semitic city and totally rejected Trump\nIt's outrageous and\nIt's outrageous enough that it can lead the kind of thing that you hear from Jim Carey who used to be a talented actor\nAnd used to be a very funny comedian and now\nHe just won the Charlie Chaplin award for excellence in comedy and a here's the way he accepted it in his acceptance speech listen\nModern times he criticized capitalism walking by drought uh challenges and that's what we have now we have capitalism without a conscience you showed the common man being fed through gears of the brutal dehumanizing industrial age\nHe took on the American right wing of his day it's worst evils hatred of immigrants in Tempe for the truth greed and the abuse of power\nWe are fighting those same evils today [noise]\n\nIn America and the United kingdom across the globe and we need to be clear shameless and this is not and will never be a superpower\nIt is the mark of a villain kidnapping children is not what great nations do\nEven though the main danger is homegrown right wing extremists many studies have pointed out this administration has methodically shifted resources away from monitoring people away from trying to control those people will keep them from committing violence but I Do apologize that heated rhetoric or as\nA okay she ah came back and apologize to them with Jake staffer after her original statement which we played on this show I Believe it was yesterday or\nHere's what she originally said that she's kind of apologizing for their

well she still apologizing she was on MSNBC\nWith Chris Matthews yesterday and a talking\nI don't know which side of the issue she's on now but again talking is the idea of nationalism lesson\nLet me
