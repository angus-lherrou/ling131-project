them talking about um a a day of Christian values [noise] country um and I recently became religious I wasn't before um but I have they didn't\nHave a tough time ah being able to get my wife right now and in a war of older\nAt a vision that came and told me it was going to be okay and worked um so I Believe in um but [noise] of American Idol the first amendment was clear that we don't want to

to stop us from doing that or\nWhat I Am I'm off all the way that you are but I don't follow the have you got from a to B before Judeo Christian based country butter we forcing people\nI'm not talking about Kanye West here I'm Talking about Ralph Nader\nRalph Nader actually suggested that President Trump is addressing some issues and listening to\nPeople in a way that was not true for President Obama for President Bush or for President Clinton will be speaking with Ralph Nader\nA very surprising take on current events and the changes he believes need to be made for the United states of America will be speaking to frequent presidential candidate Ralph Nader uh coming up on the Michael met that show first off of course a con you a west goes to the White House\nAnd this could be one of the most um unusual presidential meetings since December twenty first Nineteen Seventy\nThat was when there was a summit meeting between the king and the president or Elvis Presley came to the White House to get certified as a an operative in the war on drugs\nAnd now I'm not making it up a Elvis was kind of making up but he went along we will we will get to that but I'm One of the things that is amazing to me about this whole ...\nAnd a Trump story is the outrage over it I mean okay do I think it's weird of course it's weird it's Kanye West it's it's strange um do I think the Kanye West is in full possession of his faculties\nI don't know maybe not but so would would people criticize a liberal politician\nFor meeting with the likes of Kanye West or for people who are major stars\nWho have more serious mental health problems and Kanye West I don't think so I think a lot of this is basically the outrage of the day aimed at President Trump and [laughter] I I'm having watched the whole thing I I Do think that President Trump a deserves some credit for sitting and\nListening quietly respectfully too profound words of wisdom\nWent like this about that beautiful red hat that Kanye West has been wearing recently listen there was something about when I put\nOff and make you feel like Superman mayors Superman I was about ... favorite superhero and you may or may have for me also at the

as well for instance this explanation of why his fellow African Americans are so overwhelmingly democratic\nPeople expect that if you're black you have to be Democrats\nI have a a I have conversations that basically said that welfare of the reason why a lot of black people end up being a Democrat they say you know first of all it it is a limit to amount of jobs are so the father's lose the job and they say we'll give you more money for having more kids\nIn your home and then we got rid of the mental\nHealth Institute in the eighties and nineties and the prisoner rapes\nJust shot up now you ...

it's this waiver that helps you\nTo stay home life you know they try to scare\nMe to not ready to have my own friends but it's hot\nIt gives me it gives me the power\nI I Wonder if he has a share in the sales of a mega hats I Believe the proceeds from selling mega has to go to a promote a President Trump's reelection campaign by the way if someone\nCan explain what what Kanye West just said to the president now the president is listening very respectfully and nodding and he also got a a lesson on constitutional law concerning the thirteenth amendment that was the amendment outlawing slavery hears Kanye West are a lot\nIs is that a lot of\nGardening from him in a mall is with the adult because why would you ... around as a trap door to filling a\nIs the face of our history of\nHow would

don't do that for\nThe people they were mending also at that point it was the legal for\nThree or African American to read 'em\nAnd certainly if you actually get\n\nOkay ah\n[laughter] so much is wrong with this um I I Would think that it would be very useful for ...\nHonestly to sit down or maybe with a lovely or ms west with Kim car dashing\nAnd they could watch the uh great Daniel Day Lewis movie Lincoln because that's all about how we brought him Lincoln was the driving force behind getting the thirteenth amendment passed it was his last great achievement\nA before his assassination\nAnd I don't know what he's saying it it is absolutely true it was illegal in southern states\nTo try to teach blind people to read but by the way that didn't stop people like don't all Jackson Thomas Jon Jackson from teaching at a a school for black children slave children\nIn Lexington, Virginia a where he he was a professor of physics at Virginia military Institute anyway the point about all of this\nIs that some of the great intellectuals of the civil war period like Frederick Douglass were emphatically black\nHe was born a slave and he could not only read he could write powerfully and many others could as well\nOr he um talks a little bit about some of his own challenges a year's Kanye West again speaking right in front of the resolute desk there in the oval office

I think you were going to try to help us a little bit with uh some of what it was that you think ... was really trying to communicate the core message\nParents you with us no\nI guess he is not a first okay good now you were going to say what do you think was the important message that Tonya was communicating\nI think we're trying to communicate it ah for black people to overall exercise your mind and your ability to say and look at their most recent history and question yourself why is that every black community\nAcross the country have Martin Luther king boulevard run down but it's been um governed by Democrat you know you can't say and one and that you care for a second man was living\nIn in a situation that you would not advocate for your own terrible if I Love you I'm an advocate for things that I Know that successful in my family and I want to promote those things whether it's nice to not\nYou know the world if they were voting pencil and so I think what kind of thing that you know we need to uh to expand horizon politically and economically and other widen it from underneath the thumb of the people who claim the luck would have the history of of pricing\nPlane that they I think you said it beautifully and I wish that ah Kanye West the communicator that message as well as you did Terrence thanks for the call\nA look let me make this clear here there is so much over done media outrage I just jot down some of the stuff that they were saying and CNN\nAnd they said a man who's clearly not okay\nAirs a this little more than any airs was also on the publishing board she was a former columnist for the student newspaper she called the whole meeting of the students Senate to discuss these notes that she found on the message she received threatening her\nShe got very emotional she said she was angry frustrated and disappointed after the first threatened called her parents\nTo tell them about it because two of the messages were found in our students had desk the threats were first believed to have come from another member of the students Senate\nSanta will never be the same for mayor sat in front of her students and appears breaking down the friendships will continue to grow in our successors will always vote pry but the memory of my time in Senate OU will be marred by this experience we will all have a memory of a time when this body failed one of its own\nShe went on to call the threat Centre cowardly weaken worthless\nOkay I Will go with that she said you may find me revolting and worthy of a threat on my life but in reality it as your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head you beeping beep beep I Am proud to be who I Am and nothing you could say or do will ever change that okay good I'm Glad you're proud\nOr earlier this week airs was arrested\nBy Ohio University plays for sending threats to herself\nShe was charged with making three false reports to police or false report of this nature is considered a first degree misdemeanor she faces a maximum penalty of six months in prison and one thousand dollar fine for each charge now usually when they have these hate crime hoaxes and there are lots of them\nUp they're treated lenient like she probably won't get the six months ago I think she should to uh take up police time this kind of phony nonsense is\nIs disgusting and it's a way of attacking America\nBecause it tries to lead people to believe that somehow Americans festering with hate hate that you may feel for yourself and you generate it for yourself to make yourself look like a victim\nMost important thing to say every day I Am not a victim and refuse to be a victim Tom in Philadelphia you're on the Michael ...\nSaid the right word hey that's a shame right now the white liberal media is all upset that there's two black gentleman well known gentleman sitting in the White House talking to the president\nAbout reaching out and helping in the black community starting in the city of Chicago and and and the liberal media it's all upset that will have said over it disgusting\nWell again and it's it's it's inappropriate now look do I think that this was a high level meeting a no but it any president would do this ... majors celebrity he is breaking ranks to show strong support for the presence of course the price is going to encourage it\nAnd the idea that how can the president do this when people are suffering in Florida the president's been very outspoken he's spoken many times about the horrible devastation from hurricane Michael\nAnd I actually think the president's also done a fine and preemptive\nJob I'm preparing\nThe relief agencies for dealing with a situation here was that Chris Matthews on MSNBC was attacking Trump for doing something else well this Florida thing was going on we will will play that in in just a moment\nBut the whole idea that somehow because we have this hurricane\nOf the president isn't allowed to do something else or somehow shows disrespect look\nThis entire obsession\nWith President Trump I think isn't working for Democrats and shouldn't because we're coming up to an election it's going to decide the direction we want to go\nAnd honestly I think that when you take a look at situations like this hurricane a lot of Republicans up there on the Florida Panhandle but there are a lot of Democrats too and there are a lot of\nPeople don't really care that much about politics they all need help and support and I think they're getting that both from their state government under the great governor of Florida Rick Scott\nAnd they're getting it from the federal government doing a decent job so the freak out and the attempt to make this count politically against the president\nSeems to me utterly inappropriate when we come back I'll tell you what I'm with Chris Matthews\nHas to say that no thrill up his leg but he is um he's angry at President Trump for one for something you know other policy has ever done right well we'll get to it [noise]\n\nA a twenty two years [noise]\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations in one fell gas for a little bit less you go to that one it

standard deduction zip eliminated several tax deductions including your personal ... now if you hear the Peter patter of little tax deductions and I mean your children running around the house there's good news the child tax credit was double from one thousand to two thousand per child and the phase out now begins with four hundred thousand dollars for married couples filing jointly\nThe tax credits or dollar for dollar against your tax liability which often makes them more powerful than at a Dutch now yes it's true some families may increase in their tax liability it's not a perfect well for everybody\nBut with the lower marginal rates you'll likely see her take home pay that may be beneficial as monthly cash flow can be very meaningful to a family\nI like to cash king there are several other miscellaneous deductions that have been eliminated\nBut the new tax law was intended to stimulate economic growth let's face it the most significant tax goes or for corporations but this

Bush President but in his new book it's called to the ramp parts and the subtitle is how Bush and Obama paved the way for the Trump presidency and why it isn't too late to reverse course\nA Ralph Nader has very harsh things to say about President Bush and about President Obama and about President Clinton I'm Ralph is first of all thanks for coming on the show we always enjoy having you\nKnow but I you you are a much more than Trump kind of the ultimate outsider politically I you don't you're not a big supporter of Trump of Bush of Obama or Clinton or who do you like in presidential politics recently\nWell Bernie Sanders who did very well a regime money from small contributors and two girls and sixteen or a term goals for Twenty one years but\n[laughter] they don't they learn when did you vote for him as important Wall Street\nBarn burner worn Wall Street is out of control\nOr so so you Senator Warren Bernie Sanders did you did you support Bernie Sanders last time\nI don't support I just go on record so good things of other politicians do good things are bad things are just comment on it\nYou acknowledge that ah\nSome things and you you do in your book surprisingly that there are some things that President Trump is addressed or where you think he's on the right track\nWell ... it doesn't it doesn't deliver for example we need a big public infrastructure investment in this country who made a big they are the jobs jobs jobs repairing schools Seward drinking water systems public transit roads bridges on that\nIt took the trade issue away from the Democrats and Republicans is an interesting\nBook with Democrats and Republicans didn't pay attention to all those little communities all those are unemployed blue collar workers with the industry shipped to China and Mexico and he grabbed it from him and he got a lot of votes as a result but is that him or is that the dean of the Democrats and Republicans\nDo you have you looked over then new replacement for NAFTA the new deal because I Know you're a big critic of NAFTA\n[noise] yeah you know until my son and final form Michael to the Congress we're only getting bits and pieces we like to have the whole formal a proposed agreement\nA but it looks like it was tweaked rather than reforms in other words a little bit here a small amount of dairy products going over the Canadian border the Mexicans got a little bit the U.S got rid of this craziness were Canadian and Mexican corporation can sue the federal government saying they go\nLosses because your health and safety regulations in place but it was not a reform and it's still subordinates to commercial power\nThe labor environment and consumer rights of all three countries\nAnd right now we had another terrible day on Wall street the Dow Jones industrial average is down\nMore than five hundred points they were down eight hundred and thirty points yesterday so it's a very very big loss or an over at Wall Street a lot of people are saying that's the cause of this talk of a trade war with China do you buy it\nYeah that's part of it and the other is fair higher interest rates are screwed for small savers by the way they've been Sean of any of your income for a decade with one tenth of one percent interest raising the banks and money markers\nAnd the third thing Wall Street is generally about hasn't happened yet is inflation and so can you imagine after all this stuff in Wall Street it's still I think boom all were was on January first uh-huh\nSo what to do it if you say because what you say why isn't too late to reverse course how would you like to see America reverse course\nWork by taking a changes in our country re directions supported by liberals and conservatives you know that's my argument and if you do that by\nRestoring inflation guarded minimum wage for thirty million workers making most today and inflation adjusted wages in Nineteen sixty eight\nTo ... to ... for all free choice of doctor and hospital much less expensive and start enforcing the law against drug industry and other health industry\nAnd ... price and let me just interrupt\nYou for a moment and Medicare for all in a bind the way I um [noise]\nThere there are millions and millions of Americans who depend on Medicare who need it who are live a ... of it\nAnd uh ... how where do you find the money to pay for Medicare or a a literally a hundred million people may be more who has never paid in to Medicare\nPlenty of places number one it's a much more efficient system so you're ... you're administrative expenses today over twenty two percent through about four percent that's experience in Canada\nWhere are you but we wait on who you're talking about right now there are literally tens of millions of people I think the number is well over a hundred million I think it might be close to two hundred million who are covered by workplace insurance at least in part yeah so uh where where do you get this money to put them on Medicare\nWell they wouldn't have to pay for insurance the employers wouldn't have to pay they'd be more competitive with Canadian and foreign company companies have their insurance paid by a public sources\nSo isn't it isn't that isn't that a big give away during the ...\nThe tax system is crazy I mean you know you got corporations today paying two per cent tax three percent tax look at the banks looking at apple\nAnd they're they're they're paying virtually nothing where some workers paying twenty three twenty five percent tax going to work every day but you know what I'm saying is I get rid of corporate welfare I Know you agree with that that's hundreds of billions of dollars a year\nAnd the other thing is to crack down on criminal fraud there's there's broad on Medicare or from these van Dorn sixty billion a year just on Medicare so we have to raise the corrupt inefficient discriminatory system that is increasingly saying to the American people die\nOkay politically do you think any of these things can possibly happen say if the Democrats take over the house and the Republicans maintain control of the Senate and President Trump continues as he well as our commander in chief\nYeah I think good wage increases supported by Seventy five percent of the people without even a campaign because of all these people who\nAre you talking about increasing the minimum wage for\nMinimum wage and you see Amazon now is going up to Fifteen although a couple of loopholes so a lot of these companies you know Wal Mart is going toward twelve dollars the federal seven dollars and twenty five cents I think the Republicans against the message on that politically for twenty twenty\nOkay so you raise the minimum wage let's say the race for stage even all the way to twelve dollars I'm given the fact that in in most big cities in many jurisdictions have already raised the minimum wage or does that have a profound effect on the American economy\nYou're increases consumer demand people can buy more than ... necessities on the table you don't get many savings from increase minimum wage because they can't afford they got a pen and so I got to buy goods and services is good for the economy I mean consumer demand is two thirds of our economy\nUm what about economic growth of what happens economic growth if all of a sudden uh you are in increasing or\nThe amount of pay you're offering at a time when even right now there's a labor shortage\nWhoa labor shortage because millions of people have not come into the marketplace wherever smaller number of people have been paying jobs now than many years because of all the drop of people just couldn't get jobs in prior\nYears the other thing is you know remember Trump criticized the ... the ... the unemployment rate when he's running for president called the fake now he loves [laughter]\nYour point on your own hours a year or a week Michael you're considering employed can live on that song a former just hired you for Twenty one twenty three charger consider employed so there's a lot of uh there's a lot of reserve labor there they can go into the market\nOkay um we're speaking with Ralph Nader his new book is called to the rampart see also calls for very major changes and reforms in our political system including jumping the electoral college they're actually a lot of Americans according to polling who agree with that but I\nActually it is a complete fantasy because it never ever can happen\nOr I Want to get back to Ralph Nader and we'll talk with your calls one eight hundred ninth I find Seventeen Seventy six [noise] about how exactly you get rid of the electoral college now basically granting the whole amendment process and the constitution movie rights and\nWell I I I understand what people are talking about here with the electoral compact and I am aware of it but part of what that means is that\nThe ah the states the various states to sign onto it\nOr would be pledged to actually give all the electoral votes in their states to not to the person who wins the popular vote in the state but the person who wins the national popular vote so suddenly makes the electoral college would still exist I guess but it will become irrelevant\nBut still exists but the main event neutralized\nOkay I Do you know I I Do think there are people who are already preparing legal challenges to that compact idea plus right now all the states you mentioned are very very blue states very liberal states do you see any support for this compact idea from some of the more conservative states\nYou know the next time Republicans won the popular vote for president and lose the electoral college will get the rest of the states in a landslide\nFinally you know that's never happened the only popular vote losers who have ever been elected I'm actually are a Republican and John hone in Austin and\nTwo thousand part because of carrying got sixty thousand more votes in order to carry Ohio and won the electoral college battle or even know it got more votes popularly\nThat's true that's true it was a danger I I like the idea Ralph and I'm Talking about on the air before of everybody going to the Nebraska and Maine system that you break it down by congressional district but in order to do that you would have to really make it a nonpartisan not gerrymandered\nA portion of congressional districts what do you think about that do you have to answer a\nStep forward it doesn't go as far as the national popular vote dot com yeah that is a step forward I mean it's not going when you come in second in the popular vote in America and you lose the ... ... and you're winning the presidency ... what country does\nOkay well our our country does and it's actually historically it's worked out a okay I mean and president Hayes wasn't a disaster or some of his thing President Bush wasn't a disaster\nAnd are certainly hope that President Trump will continue to enjoy some of the success he's enjoyed so far Ralph Nader's enjoyed great success with his literary legal and even some political endeavors\nHis new book is called to the rampart how Bush and Obama paved the way for the Trump presidency and why it's too late to reverse course we're going to not reverse course but change course the Supreme Court in one state just declared that all of the people who are on

very significant\nWhen a for secretary of state Mike Pompeo and for President Trump the a U.S and turkey Wall Street journal is reporting are expected to begin mending very difficult relations because turkey apparently has agreed\nTo release tomorrow a pastor Andrew Brunson was being held for some time uh\nIn Turkey on trumped up I mean really completely Trump to terrorism charges it all has to do a with the um Turkish obsession with this one ... who's here in the United states but in any event uh\nThis would be very very good news and it probably also relates to what just happened at the consulate in Istanbul\nAnd that is the Turkish consulate pardon me these Sally consulate in Istanbul where this journalist who is actually contributing columnist to American newspapers was American resident not an American citizen but a\n... just disappeared and they have video showing him going into the consulate\nBut he didn't come out just disappeared and it may be that in return for turkey releasing pastor Brunson which will be a very good thing and there'll be celebrations and and there should be\nBut in return for that the United states may cooperate using some of our security and policing resources\nTo help find out whether the Saudis really did murder this guy\nBecause even though right now we have very strong relations with Saudi Arabia and we have terrible relations with turkey if something like that in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul happened that was a criminal murder or some kind of rendition where they took him somewhere and then it's going to have consequences and this is going to be bipartisan\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six okay not such good news the Supreme Court in my state and the state of Washington\nStruck down the state's death penalty today ruling that it had been used in an arbitrary and racially discriminatory manner now there are not hundreds of people on death row in Washington there are eight\nWell that's not true now let me let me go over some of the people who are on death row in the state of Washington and all of these people have been given quite literally a new lease on life by the nine justices of the Washington state Supreme Court they are virtually all\nUltra liberal and\nAt this should not be a decision that is made by the court if the legislature wants to eliminate the death penalty then that's okay but eliminating the death penalty for people who have already gone to trial who have been condemned who have been sentenced\nPeople like Robert Robert league aids is a serial killer who's responsible for the deaths of more than a dozen women many in Spokane area he was convicted\nIn two thousand and two for the murders of a twenty four year old named uh Melinda Mercer and a thirty five year old named ...\nBoth killings were committed in tears county Washington he's been on death row since two thousand seven he's white by the way then there's counter Michael's chairman I remember

night killed two women and two children whether we're sleeping he went into my house and then was permitted he knew exactly what it was a very upset the disappointed and feel betrayed easily in Ferguson they're more concerned about keeping marijuana legal\nThan a protecting the victims and doing what's right what will that mean for him to\nDeath and ... kind of firemen\nIn fact the kid I Will be relieved that would be completely relieves and feel like justice being served\nOkay a he's entirely correct and that's particularly horrifying case\nAnd and that idea that the court intervenes on behalf of someone like that I mentioned that there was another case that shows you exactly why you need this by the way ... also white\nThe and I mentioned that because the Supreme Court is using racial injustice as the basis for throwing out the death penalty on these folks\nWho have all been arrested they'd been tried they've been been investigating been convicted again and again and again and again\nAnd they deserve the death penalty particularly\nByron sure why he was convicted of killing a correctional officer named Jamie bendel by strangling her with an amplifier court inside a

point is already serving a life sentence so what are you going to do to him he's just\nMurdered this fine young woman strangled her to death in the chapel\nAnd um\n[noise] Bengals a sister the sister of the victim whose name is Lisa ham told reporters in\nTwo thousand Thirteen after he got the death sentence is I've been waiting a hundred and thirty seven days exactly to hear those words that he's got the death penalty I'm going to continue to count until he finally did\nUh well Washington state Supreme Court says no seat the idea\nThat\nThe opinion of these justices\nAbout a law they don't like should all of a sudden take it out throw it out ruined all the time and\nAll the effort if you know prosecutors I Know a bunch of prosecutors it is so hard so difficult as it should be to get a conviction on to get the death penalty but what you're doing right now on this flimsy\nBasis of a state constitution and no one cannot I Believe it cannot be appealed\nTo the U.S Supreme Court

incredibly brutal murders only them who are on death row in in the state of Washington are they all instantly\nHave the death penalty withdrawn they are now going to spend life in prison but probably knowing the way these things work that won't even be held true I mean the only reason people spend\nA life in prison today is if they are really notorious killer as like Charlie ... who died in prison of course or Sirhan Sirhan we just had the fiftieth anniversary he should have received the death penalty but that was another Supreme Court decision\nThat spared their lives that was a federal decision by the way by our old Supreme Court\nA one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number you can also reach us by Twitter\nAnd we've had a big upsurge in our a Twitter activity recently I think a lot of surrounding the Brett Kavanaugh issue but uh you can reach us with a tweet a disagreeing tweet by going to a ... show on Twitter that's at Medford show one word on Twitter\nOkay this came in from John in ... Washington\nHe says yesterday a caller proposed that we are in the Cold War and a political sense he rejected it and he had trouble defining you stated that the objective of war is to defeat an enemy\nActually I didn't say that\nI said the object of a war is to destroy an enemy it's to kill your enemy and wreck his stuff\nJust wipe them out not just defeat\nSays this is exactly what is going on meaning to defeat an enemy not to destroy it the Democrats have decided to use any means necessary to defeat the Kavanaugh nomination\nThey've abandoned all decency it is a whole war because bullets are not being shot but there is no question the Democrats mean too politically professionally and socially kill Brett Kavanaugh it is a Cold War\nAnd now Kavanaugh and his family are getting death threats if this is not a Cold War Michael I don't know what would be a Democrats have Declared Political and professional war against this man looks the term Cold War is also misunderstood\nWhat people mean by Cold War is limited war\nIt was not bloodless we lost fifty eight thousand Americans in Vietnam we lost almost forty thousand in Korea\nUh during so cold Cold War we lost countless other Americans in different hot spots around the world are there were very certainly an episode of the Cold War was the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the pushback against that a lot of people who died\nAnd I do think it is wrong to analogize\nThe idea of of trying to smear and discredit somebody and wreck his career I think it's despicable I think what the Democrats did was despicable I think there are whole handling of the cabinet matter was shameful and unconscionable and wrong in his right to be condemned\nBut to call it murder\nIs also obliterated distinctions and I think distinctions that need to be restored or public debate I'll give you one example\nI woke up thinking about this is people are now talking about everybody has a survivor right anybody who was ever complained about sexual misbehavior of some guy no matter how far in the past or how limited than this behavior is now a survivor of abuse and I was thinking of Anita Hill\nAnd this is not to say that if Clarence Thomas were guilty of the things he's accused of that it would be justifiable indefensible would have been wrong\nBut the idea that any of the hill a survivor what\nDid she survived exactly she survived um some rude comments that made her uncomfortable that song no charges any workplace consequences\nTo her work by Clarence Thomas no charges that he ever touched her\nI I mean to say that is a survivor and somebody who's been raped at knife point is also a survivor of there's a difference and yes there's a difference between Bill Cosby and Les Moonves iffy what Bill Cosby drugged people that's\nMore serious and to lose all perspective to say that we are now dealing with the civil war because we're dealing with a moral issue the equivalent of slavery\n... it's it's just wrong and no one expects that there are big parts of America that are going to have their duly constituted governments leave the union\nForm armies and we're all going to be finding one another and they're going to be hundreds of thousands were killed\nSo the analogy was a civil war I think detract from people's engagement with reality\nWhere you can make a real difference in bringing America to a more constructive place by voting in this election I Hope everybody does and vote for sanity and Saturday means stop\nThe talk of impeaching Kavanaugh stopped to talk of impeaching Trump stopped to talk of oh my goodness this is the total nightmare of The Handmaid's tale we're losing all our liberties and the women are being brown down as the end of the world\nYou had a grim we have some problems in this country but hysteria doesn't help and solutions let's go to North ridge California Eric you're on the bed show disagreement day\nMike I'm a longtime listener conservative here and um I Do agree that this commentary about the civil war is a over rot in its comments but I disagree with you you are in that I Do see a future of separation coming a rich and the stupid foreign calls\nAnd what's actually coming I was coming in the horizon for our country is a divorce\nAnd say you know that there's gonna be a war you are yourself or just building this up with this idea that there'd be hundreds of thousands of people killed\nWe have a great separation we have a mechanism available to us and I'm Wondering why what\nWhat is the mechanism what's the mechanism\nOh say they're just one moment let me say this we talked about before why would you deprive be one of the great rights provided to me the constitution and that's the freedom of association\nI Know you'll have you'll have you'll have you'll have come to find any more than don't but you you live in the same country with him you live in the same country with them there is no right in the constitution\nFor secession it doesn't exist you know and\nThat's like we discussed before it's not just session what it is is this illusion of the union which has provided through article five the mechanism is available through article five would not be a war\nOf how what how was how is the mechanism provided for dissolution of the union they never anticipate of that and it's not there there's an article five a convention of the states is who proposed changes in the constitution that still have to then be approved by three quarters of the states the\nMike I called in about a year ago you had a constitutional scholar on and he agreed you you simply don't\nWant no no no no I it's it's it's if you believe a convention of the states could provide for the dissolution of the union or you just have to then get three quarters of the states to vote to dissolve the union and they want\nAs a student of history Mike I Want to quote something to you went in the course of human events it becomes necessary\nFor one people to dissolve the bans a bind them to another\nThat have ... that have connected them into another some by disconnected them but but you know and okay so that's the\nDeclaration of independence and our great founding fathers realize that these things happen in the\nCourt okay so tell me tell me what you believe is the issue that is worth dissolving the union over\nWell you're in you approached me on that before and a habit forming you never wanted to answer and that is the\nKilling the murder of over forty million American Babies that al ... actually written into the Democrat platform\nOkay again that can be a reason you don't want to associate with Democrat but frankly right now we have made tremendous progress in reducing the abortion rate\nBut if you think that somehow it will help to save lives to save the lives of the unborn by breaking up the United states of America which is the greatest force for good in the history of human kind [noise]\nIt what do you mean they're not being dealt with in other words the two parties disagree and it's a tough time of tough time to find middle ground but you say that are are medical care system you don't think we spent a long time over the last ten years arguing about that it's more than ten years when Bill Clinton was first elected president and he came in the Nineteen nineties\nYeah Michael who's you're\nWorking for working for the medical industry the insurance industry and the attorneys the older the goals which is\nThis is great for them gotten extremely wealthy and powerful ... doing nothing except tried it off to the courts work through the executive branch out to the laws you talked\nVery OK well wait wait wait wait wait I again when you talk about some kind of establishment conspiracy was the establishment for Obamacare or was it against Obamacare\nSport\nOkay ah then ... the ... you will agree with me that\nThere was a very significant difference of opinion between Republicans and Democrats or wasn't a single Republican not even one in either house Congress we voted for Obama Care\nAbsolutely there's not an issue there but I Would like wait\nWait you're saying that they ignored this issue the last had their own approach to medical care which I think was the wrong approach which is the medical care needs to improve his more government involvement I think we would all benefit from less government involvement\nAnd and people having more freedom of choice and getting their own insurance arrangements that it it seems to me is going to be one of the challenges for the next two years for President Trump and the Republicans if we maintain our majorities in Congress we we've got to continue moving in that direction\nThe idea that these issues that you bring up\nA little aren't instantly resolved or it doesn't mean that there's some kind of establishment conspiracy look there are a lot of people in the United states of America who are doing a lot better in the last two years and it is not just rich people\nThe or the fact is that if you look at the wages that have been going up I mean even Ralph Nader acknowledge that when we were talking to him on the economic growth that has happened in the last two years\nHas benefited everybody in the country\nAnd look we've got two bad days on Wall street I Hope that won't be the end but you see the the problem with all these ideas about some all knowing establishment is trying to put some order some fake water into what is by its very nature have varied this orderly and sometimes chaotic process\nI it is disagreement day
