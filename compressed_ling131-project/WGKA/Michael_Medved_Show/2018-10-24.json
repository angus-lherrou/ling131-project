Columbia because the students said we want to determine what we study that has now become the norm\nThey are not told in most cases what they have to study unless they have a major yes to get a degree in history you must take the following history course that's true but they they aren't there was no general requirements in most of our universities that I stand by that because I saw it happen in my own life\nI got you have vast majority of the student Jerry liners choir crunch is that\nYes I just said that Mike I I just said that you're you're listening to speak as you said before if you I did say that I said if you have a major in history you will have some required courses in history but general requirements\nWhat students or college years\nOkay you're you're you're Oregon then let me be clear I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that I haven't been clear\nFor example you have to take the course of Columbia courses in Colombia in western civilization to get a degree if you majored in bought me or you majored in uh in German or you majored in physics you still have to take certain courses\nIn order to get a BA generally speaking those have been dropped out of our universities

[noise] this is Michael\nAnd another great day and the greatest nation on God's green earth a great day when a lot of our protective apparatus in this country is operating just the way it should working to apprehend a criminal somebody who was threatened mass murder and apparently ... a credibly threaten mass murder [noise]\nTo a lot of political officials and a lot of people involved in media\nI ah I Know that CNN was all terribly indignant earlier big cause the White House mentioned political and Fishell but it didn't mention that CNN was the target of one of the bombs and they apparently\nAre bombs they're rudimentary they're not highly sophisticated but they apparently are operational\nAnd good for the NYPD and the FBI and the New York bombs was basically an all the people who are trying to deal with this and do it also for some of the reactions not all of them some of the reactions have been appalling\nAnd hypocritical and wrong\nA but not Steve skull east of the various reactions that I've seen I think the one from the whip for the Republican Party in the house of representatives\nOf the honorable Steve ... congressmen from Louisiana who's been a friend of his show us Steve writes these attempted attacks that have been made or beyond criminal their acts of pure terror\nViolence in ... I have no place in our politics or anywhere else in our society I've experienced firsthand the effects of political violence and I'm committed to using my voice to speak out against it where ever I Can't\nThose responsible for these evil acts of terror and yes even if no one has killed God willing known will be killed these are evil acts he writes those responsible for these evil acts of terror must be hunted down and brought to justice and I have great confidence that our law enforcement officers will succeed in that mission\nAs a nation we must agree that this is a dangerous path\nAnd cannot become the new normal\nExcellent that is fine and by the way what the president said he spoke after Milan yen millennia was promoting some of her causes any complimented his wife speaking as she introduced him he got a standing ovation\nAnd uh then the uh the president said this about the bombing attempts\nTo suspicious packages and devices meld to current and former high ranking government officials to safety of the American people is my highest an absolute priority\nI've just concluded a briefing with the FBI department of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service as we speak the packages are being is affected by top explosive experts at a major federal investigation is now underway\nTo full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expensive this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\n[noise] what the\nPresident said is fine and it's appropriate and he offered a little bit more to be more specific here's President Trump\n[noise]\nBut it's a very bipartisan state but I can tell you from both sides we both agree on that\nDisagree just conduct is a board to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans my administration will provide additional updates as they become available and I just want to thank everybody for their understanding [noise]\nWere extremely angry upset unhappy about what we would this this morning and we will get to the bottom of it\nOK given the fact that two of the most prominent targets of these bombs were Hillary Rodham Clinton who President Trump defeated and the election\nAnd the Democratic president that he replaced Brock Obama I think it would be helpful for the president or for Sarah Sanders frankly to reveal I mean enough revealed is obviously but I think it would be a good thing for President Trump to call President Obama and for President Trump to call Secretary Clinton\nAnd to express his concern and his gratitude that they and their families are okay\nBecause uh ... just saying that doing it would detoxify this entire matter and one of the things that I resent is mainstream media right now and a lot of democratic leaders\nAre injecting toxin into this situation\nThey're basically trying to blame Trump for this now I get it I understand most of the people who have been targeted are very clearly identified with the left their opponents of Trump\nThey include Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and Morocco bomb and yes all three of them are African American I understand that it also includes Hillary Rodham Clinton Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nAnd I'm I'm oh and George Soros she was the first one to receive a a package and apparently they are now saying\nThat the package was actually delivered in person by somewhat it was not mailed to George Soros but the package with this rudimentary bomb and it was delivered to Soros his home outside of New York city and um\n[noise] look at the idea that Trump is to blame for this of course that is irresistible to the left\nAnd it seems to me it is entirely wrong I sent out a tweet about this immediately when that tendency started\nAnd I understand that there are people in the media who are trying to link together for phenomena what are the four phenomena these bombs the bomb scare number to the show the murder number three the fact that Trump ... says that it's fake news is the enemy of the people\nAnd um and and a number for the uh the\nIdea that Trump praised at a rally in Montana\nThe body slamming of reporter by congressman Greg Gianforte by the way to apologize lavishly who paid the guide damages who apologized again and actually was pleaded guilty in court for assault and battery\nSo ah here's here's the point is it four separate things Greg John forte\nThe Trump assaults on news media as fake news an enemy of the people the murder of ... and these bomb scares which are attempted murder\nWhat's the connection between all for nothing\nThere is no connection the first two are evil\nThreatening to murder people sending out bombs to people's homes that is evil\nMurdering Jamal 'cause she'll be which no American had any role in at all was evil and it's been denounced that way by the president the United states the other two things Trump sprays of Congressman John forte for the most embarrassing moment of his life\nAnd Trump's general bragging on the news media is enemy that people are stupid and it's embarrassing it's not evil and it's not a crime\nAnd basically trying to associate these things is wrong it is irresponsible I Know is there is this double\nFor people on the left especially Thirteen Days before an election but it's deeply irresponsible you want to hear about irresponsible Jack Reed the senator from Rhode Island was on uh CNN and of course CNN let him directly just saying what CNN wanted to hear listen\nI think is quite obvious us some of this is a reflection of the the base tone a debate and the president of the United states is that a rally and smiles as people chant lock her up or make through direct attacks on the news media\nThat doesn't raise the level of debate that lowers the and it creates this environment where these acts could take place and not only being an attack I think the other half boy have this or act that the found out is someone is fending as exploded a device anonymously to people who could be hurt\nAnd and this is something that is just just just to wrap it\nIt's not just disreputable is not just ... cowardice is evil but the point is we don't know anything about the perpetrator yet I Hope we will soon\nAnd one of these guys are wrong let me give you an example of something else that was just a couple of days ago that in Washington DC in northwest Washington Fox five Fox News in other words was attacked\nPresident Trump condemned the newsroom shooting and offered his condolences but he is often portrayed the news media is the enemy that people\nAfter the shooting the publisher of the New York times AJ shoals burgers had in a statement that he told the president in private meetings that quote his language was nauseous device of but increasingly dangerous in other words what did they have to do with the newsroom shooting in Annapolis\nOr the attack on Fox News which is where disappeared in the paper\nOr this we don't know yet\nIt'll be interesting to find out we do know be on any shadow of a down\nThat wins Steve ... was severely wounded and there was an attempt and and so we're Washington officers severely wounded assigned to protect the congressman and other attempts to kill other Republican congressman\nThat was politically motivated the guy was clear about it but\nListen to what Nancy Pelosi said at the time when a and this is more than a year ago this is June of two thousand Seventeen right after Steve ... was shot she asked about uh some Republicans would condemn some of the hospital democratic rhetoric and here's what she said\nThey have or comments from Republicans including times raved about Israel rhetoric\nLeft being in some ways\nWell I think that your question is an excellent one and I think that the comments made by my Republican colleagues are outrageous than eat the dignity of the job that they hold an eighth of dignity and respect that we would like Congress to command\nHad their they say such a thing how dare they so this sick individual\nThat's something that the ball and it was horrible what he did hateful but for them to all the sudden they sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before and I don't want to go into president the United states but in terms of some of the language that he has you know again I\nLet's go there and the other day that come to ask how could they possibly say such as\nFar as the way they have such a thing the way they could say such a thing is big cause that shooter had told other people that he had a grudge against Republicans he had been just active and the Bernie Sanders' campaign for president\nHe was deeply politically active and apparently mumbled to his wife all the time when he saw stuff on TV we know the guy was politically motivated\nSo the only kind of political motivation that can be condemned is if it is from the right well there are other people who say no this couldn't have been from the right this is probably a leftist set up can I say we don't know when will we find out we'll get to that with your calls coming

Obama in their home and the former attorney general Eric Holder\nAh of ah the Obama administration along with representative Maxine Waters apparently and we had a\nCaller who referred to the bomb that had been apparently though this has not been confirmed planted in the same building\nThat houses the San Diego union Tribune the main papers in San Diego\nBut apparently that same building had the office of senator or one of the offices field offices and our common law hire us so\nThat potentially could go along with very prominent\nLeft wing targets and that would be the first person really who was identified more with the Bernie wing of the party then with the very left mainstream of the party that Bernie weighing being left of left\nA one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six he was the president of the United states speaking earlier today and if you have something that you find objectionable in what the president had to say give me a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nSuspicious packages and devices meld to current and former high ranking government officials to safety of the American people is my highest sand absolute priority\nI've just concluded a briefing with the FBI department of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service as we speak the packages are being inspected by top explosive experts at a major federal investigation is now underway\nThe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America [noise] people\nAre applauding and then I Know I Know I Know the monitor on the left if there was somebody a sitting here who is a congressional candidate and there isn't\nA from a the Democratic party was his ... no he condemns political violence but a at his rallies he ah encourage people to beat up some of the protesters I think someone with President Trump said at his rallies during the campaign\nWas stupid and it was irresponsible and he shouldn't have said those things but is it necessary\nFor him now to go back there and say gee I'm Sorry I said these comments more than two years ago in the middle of a campaign it's not necessary for him to do that what has happened\nIs he has stopped encouraging violence and then somebody's going to say well the other night he was speaking in Montana\nAnd he congratulated a congressman Greg John forte for having body slammed a reporter or who um got on his nerves it wasn't even a reporter would have been particularly hostile to Congressman John forte\nLook I think it was a mistake I don't think he should have done that and handed the other side that kind of support but the idea that that is somehow associated\nWith somebody trying to kill people and whether or not these bombs were very well made up it was an attempt to kill people or at least make people think that they were being threatened with death\nAnd it was outrageous\nAnd look there should be no problem at all with people like knowledge ing President Trump said something very good there\nHe said we should condemn political violence of every time we should condemn scuffles we shouldn't condemn people and by the way it is part of what he very imperfect Leon very poorly try to do in some of his garbled and messed up response to Charlottesville\nOr when he said there are bad people on both sides what he said it was terrible as he said they're good people on both sides there weren't\nBut there were bad people on both sides and that was accurate\nAnd if he can go ahead and consistently now condemn people from groups from the Proud Boys to end chief uh from the neo Nazis to us some of the other people on the extreme left\nWho won't allow speech to proceed you know something I was just I just found out about ... and it's it's appalling to me because look I I have a certain affection for the physical a Yale University campus and I spent close to seven years of my life there\nAnd [noise]\n[noise] right now I'm Harold camp has been totally defaced by graffiti and all the graffiti is excerpts from the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford right\nOkay what is the point of that for goodness sake I guess the point is because Brett Kavanaugh went to Yale College and the ... law school he was also there for seven years so now they have graffiti to remind people I mean really\nThat's pathetic\nAnd yes political violence and intolerance is pathetic whichever direction that comes from\nAnd I hear you I have two members of Congress actually former members of Congress or David Jolly of Florida who by the way is very anti Trump and Steve Israel of above Florida who well surprise is very anti Trump here's how they sounded on MSNBC\nWe're in an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the president of United States\nAnd it's not just going to Montana and endorsing body slamming and it's not just saying that neo Nazis you know are good people there are good people on both sides of a more including neo Nazis remember the president of states in the campaign offered to pay the legal bills\nOf his supporters are if they attacked his opponents I'll just say one other thing on this it's not even just the president we have a bomb squad at CNN or the CNN building in New York City today yesterday I was walking in New York City and I pass\nThe the building where Fox News's headquartered and the ticker the digital ticker that displays news and the building was reporting on the George Soros a bomb threat and it began with these words for the man who has everything that's not funny\nIt is dangerous and so it's not just a president who gives a license to violence but those who are enabled by that violence they have a responsibility to make sure that we are a racing values of a piece of safety and not point gas on the plane was happening too often\nI mean I'm Sorry how does how does I I don't know what the Fox ticker actually said but if it said for the man who has everything\nIs he sure that that was in the context of George Soros I I don't know but it seems to me that if you are in the midst of a heated political campaign\nIs very easy to say this rhetoric goes over the top or this is wrong or the president said you should beat up protesters who disrupt his rallies that's different from murder\nIt is and it's different from condoning murder and the problem the refusal to make a distinction between things that some people in the right may say that are sometimes embarrassing and irresponsible and\nWith the ... murder at really you want to show me that I'd love to hear\nFrom a prince Mohammed bin Salman oh yeah President Trump told me it was okay I heard him attacking the lying stinking disgusting fake news media and I thought okay I'll do something no of course he didn't ... didn't\nAt first of all we don't even know Solomon a\nMom had been some on was actually directly responsibly probably was but the idea that he was somehow encouraged by Trump's ongoing fused with MSNBC and CNN\nIs ridiculous I Do hope\nThat when we emerged on the other end of the election day whatever happens and I hope urgently ... earnestly that the Republicans prevail\nBut that we can move on from this this stupid back and forth on both sides it doesn't do the country any good to have\nVoices in the media just perpetually blaming the president for everything and attacking him for everything with a visceral hatred that I Do believe is unique it goes beyond anything that they applied to George W. Bush a Ronald Reagan or anyone else\nLet's um\nOr go to um [noise] John Berman who is an American news anchor and currently the co anchor CNN new day with Allison come right on CNN he's a regular a relief presenter of Anderson Cooper three sixty this is what he had to say\nIt could have been sent to John Berman\nMeant to be because they said John Brennan on the packages had Brennan B. R. E. N. A. and\nI see okay so nobody knows that package was sent it but if it was sent to John Brennan which is more likely than he's another politician not primarily a media figure a meanwhile\nThe down is

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] so the\nQuestion is how should presidents from respond\nNow to a new joint statement from the two leaders of the Democratic party in Congress both of them want to be majority leaders are in Thirteen Days from now\nWhen they we have a great big election uh also thirty six governors' on the ballot in that election is so important to be sure you vote\nHere is what's on Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer had to say we listen with great interest of the president's remarks this afternoon we'll take an oath to support and defend the constitution and to protect the American people and that is our first responsibility\nHowever they say President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence\nTime and again the president is condone physical violence and divided Americans with his words in his actions expressing support for the congressman who body slammed a reporter\nNeo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville he never expressed support for killing a young woman in Charlottesville it's outrageous and it's wrong\nLook he was an ... that's an outrageous charge and they have it right in their\nExpressing support for the neo Nazis killed a young woman in Charlottesville he never did that expressing his supporters uh sport is at rallies who get violent with protesters dictators around the world who murder their own citizens and referring to the free press as the enemy that people\nLook at the the instinct here to play politics with a direct in serious threat\n... would they still be doing that if if one of these bombs going off and people were killed it would be it would be even more outrageous and it is\nOkay not villa find somebody but has she answered the question about what should be done when the caravan comes to the borders of the United states and and this is where the Democrats fail completely because they have nothing to say about it\nIn other words at least President Trump has the virtue of cat clarity here he does not want some kind of mass injury engineering states and by the way we can all I think relax a little bit there's an interesting piece in the Los Angeles times\nAbout the asylum process and about the level of illegal immigration and it uh it it mentions that illegal immigration right now is at a forty year low\nThey only years where illegal immigration has been even lower than it is right now\nWe're the last three years including last year the Obama administration has been brought way way down and brought down by three quarters way greatly reduced\nPart of it a bad economy part of a much better border security which began by the way under President Bush in any event here's the interesting thing\nWhen uh people come here in terms of uh\nApplying for asylum between a year two thousand twelve and two thousand Seventeen in other words including the Trump Administration\nImmigration judges turned back Seventy five percent of the people who came here from Guatemala seeking asylum\nSo she may say it's America's strength to be tolerant accepting but right now including under President Obama and yes under President Trump most people are coming looking for asylum are turned back and that\nSeems to me is reasonable and says the Trump Administration has made the process even more difficult by ordering immigration judges to stop granting asylum to virtually all those claiming to be victims of domestic violence a move that could block\nTens of thousands of people from gaining permanent entry into the U.S and in other words if you're running away from an abusive husband you probably don't have to run away two thousand miles to get to the United states\nAnd that seems to me is reasonable enough or let us go to your calls to John in Columbus ohio John you're on the Michael ...\nMike I'm yeah I I just find that you know disheartening as an unbelievable ... out the ... paid for that left side media is lying they don't give you that the whole story it got things out anything they can do\nTo the ... it's really perpetrating the flawed it was I'm concerned but I'm ... and the the the the political he won the left side\nThere that are lower than bottom feeder tactic of marrying President Trump and it is a lot of accounting he's he's pretty much get this war he stayed on target he's trying but like you said nobody is perfect guy created nobody's perfect\nRight but the point is it don't you I I don't Jay would be helpful if folks on our side didn't for instance chant lock her up lock her up um I mean again it's I I think the American people are kind of tired of that and that's OK maybe in the height of a campaign\nBut I don't think it helps our side and it's not a question that there's some kind of great huge moral outrage or this crosses some line that's inscribed in the heavens it's dumb politics because actually particularly the key deciding voters in a\nIn this coming election are going to be white suburban women\nAnd I'm not sure the chance of a lock her up for anybody are going to help gym in Portland, Oregon you're on the Mike I'm Yvette show\nI like I was wondering um if or how can our political community a de polarized and get back at some of 'em respect for a loyal opposition I I Hope it's not forever lost it doesn't look good do right now\nI agree with you and a look I\nI think if I'm a ... one of the things that that will be important is particularly if you look at some of the ads that the Democrats are running I mean some of them I've seen it down in Oregon we have a good chance of electing a Republican governor and um and and here in in my state\nThe ads are so hateful the most important thing is not to reward\nHateful miss don't reward it or you'll get more of it and when people say well you have to vote democratic to put some kind of check on President Trump selection isn't about President Trump is about Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer charm status\nIs not going to change is going to continue is president the question is do those guys deserve a promotion\nTo be put in charge of the U.S Congress and the answer is overwhelmingly and obviously no no no

actor and [noise]\nI'm not so much anymore what do we heard from recently or seen recently\nFrom Jim Carrey other than his very strong politically themed paintings [noise] he came out with a painting that he just did and it is the ugliest most hateful thing imaginable [noise]\nIt shows a crude caricature of President Trump\nWith an open now and in the middle of his mouth is a pipe bomb like the photographs of the pipe bomb\nThat they you know and I don't even want to posted its its ugly and it's disgusting and\nAre they are\nReporting the Jim Carrey is pending at least part of the blame for multiple explosive devices targeting Democrats and CNN on President Trump is not being part of the blame blame of putting the blame it shows Obama emerging from Trump's mouth\nTrump spoken the bomb came into existence\nGod's spoken light in the world came into existence so why not Trump ... create a pipe bomb in his mouth in any event uh he um the the pipe bombs of course this this morning we're targeting\nAnd by the way there is not is not true it is fake news that there was a pipe bomb targeting CNN there was a pipe bomb targeting John Brennan now I guess they misspelled his name they spell the B. R. E. N. A. and I just want and not to\nAnd but they addressed it to them care of CNN hails so does by the way commentary on MSNBC he um he he actually plays\nBoth sides of the aisle on that one both so balanced\nCNN and MSNBC in other words that but MSNBC did not get a John Brennan package CNN did\nBut all of these packages seemed to be very directly him personally addressed two prominent figures on the American left bronco bomb Hillary Clinton former attorney general Eric Holder congresswoman Maxine Waters and yes ah also congresswoman\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz now you may have heard on the show and as I Know it can be a little bit confusing that the return address on these packages on all of them apparently was Debbie Wasserman Schultz no one believes that she's the one who sent bonds [laughter]\nUsually these and the bomb you don't put your real address on it I mean and I know Debbie Wasserman Schultz has an idiot she is but uh no she didn't do this ... I don't I don't think anyone is suspecting that congresswoman Wasserman Schultz did this\nWhat obviously was going on here\nIs that this was the warped sense of humor or the evil and warped individual whoever it is who did this who figured oh great if they don't deliver this package and they return it then I'll get bad Debbie Wasserman Schultz and in trouble if even if I don't blow her I was a bomb that I sent her way\nA look all of this this is serious enough and I'm OK Debbie Wasserman Schultz today condemned the packages\nSent this week with her return address ... saying she is deeply disturbed that her name was attached to well I I can imagine that I can sympathize with that\nPackages apparently can turning can painting explosives were sent on Wednesday to high level democratic leaders including former President Obama former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was Wasserman Schultz is off as a name as the return address\nOne of those packages addressed former attorney general Eric Holder was returned to Wasserman Schultz his office because it was sent the wrong address two of her Florida offices were evacuated and responds she confirmed understatement\nThey one time Democratic National committee chair she's been replaced by the indescribable fulltime Paris or she says in her statement we will not be intimidated by this attempted act of violence the polling attack on our democracy\nMust be vigorously prosecuted and I am deeply disturbed by the way my name was used okay I think it it makes it fairly clear that um there are a lot of suspects on this and I hope that by the time we're on the air tomorrow\nThey will have identified a suspect they certainly should they should move as quickly and decisively as I possibly can but a\nMeanwhile there's all sorts of craziness Stacey Abrams is running for governor of Georgia and there were a series of issues\nHer up to one of them not that serious one of them seems to me very serious and one of them they just seem to me is very very serious the one that wasn't that serious is that on the former flag of the state of Georgia she engage while she was in college\nIn a protest or in which the state flag non the American flag the state flag was burned they cause it had the old Confederate\nBattle flag in the flag\nThey changed the state flag she has never been involved with burning other flags since then okay let that one go for a moment much more serious\nShe has called for doing a Taliban on Stone Mountain which is a huge and and beautiful mountain and city park\nWhere it would cost literally hundreds of millions of dollars and it would be unsightly and destructive to erase the work of art that was put up there in Nineteen thirty one is when they finished that they've started putting it up and Nineteen fourteen and say three acres three acres of carved stone\nAnd she wants to blow it up I think it's perfectly appropriate if they put signage they're all around us saying that this image of Jefferson Davis and Robert helium Stonewall Jackson commemorates the cause that we do not on her support\nAnd I think it's been very clear that the government of Georgia the government of the whole United States\nHas rejected the whole idea of the confederacy\nAnd the white supremacy that the confederacy was based upon very proudly and very directly that's fine\nBut this idea that they're they're even black leaders who have spoken out against Stacey Abrams radical position about basically blowing up and Dinah mining Stone Mountain it's a Taliban position and it stinks\nAnd even worse was what you said last night now look I\nUnderstand the Democrats are trying to capitalize on this health care issue but you think the way to capitalize on the health care issue is to trash the entire free market system here is with Stacey Abrams the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia had to say last\nNight [laughter] and higher here you know [noise] [laughter] [noise] remark so\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay the whole idea there is no profit and doing the right thing is entirely wrong\nBecause the very essence of the free market system the very essence of capitalism is that you give people what they want and how do you know what they want is what they pay for\nAnd the notion that no one can make a profit doing the right thing that is only government that can provide for people\nIs utterly ludicrous and what\nShe is saying here I Hope loses her the election I really really do because once you've suggested ... is that the free market system that we have to the extent that we even have a free market system any more than we do to a large extent you still have a lot of choice in your medical care\nAnd the idea that that is inappropriate when she says I've never seen the free market uh write a prescription in rural Georgia I'll bet there are people in rural Georgia who were listening to us right now\nWho have gone in and gotten prescriptions through the free market either because you have health insurance that covers it or because you pay for the prescription yourself and because it's made available at a local pharmacy now does that local pharmacy make profit by selling your prescription\nOf course they do but you see that's the whole idea of a free market you pay them rather than in slave in them\nAnd government forces a matter of enslavement this is the point that I'm Rand makes brilliantly is that basically to get people what you want to do you can either use money and pay them to do what you want them to do or you can use force\nBut that's basically it\nI Know of course you can persuade people to do what you want them to do and then you do something for them in return but that's a free market transaction as well\nGovernment transactions are always by their very nature a balanced force and the idea that someone is the Democratic party nominee in the state of Georgia\nWho believes that the free market has to be rejected because you can't make a profit doing the right thing for goodness sake\nWas just like this who thousand one one the terrorism was you know lost on us and the building was my threats that you know our government our financial structures and everything around her neck for men so I think is just part of\nThe ... using all the time you you also think
