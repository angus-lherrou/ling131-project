or deteriorated and would he would be still in light of all the evidence used for it as soon as an example of police racism\nBecause I talk about that a fair amount or with him and I would ask him what the\nWhat he objects to and various foreign policy and domestic issues the president current president has pursued Matt in Arcadia\nWhat is it that can bring Americans to\nOther a lot of people used to be brought together by the space program it used to be a source of great unanimity and pride and everybody coming together to support those brave astronauts in what they achieved [noise] there's a new movie about that\nIt is called first man it is about the first man on the moon Neil Armstrong [noise] played by Ryan Gosling\nAnd it's directed by the same director who did la la land in whiplash talented\nIs it worth seeing does it show the American flag after all will answer all questions about first man a little bit later in the program\nWe'll also talk about another source of political unity for the United states which is a a complete contempt total contempt\nThen is shared by Americans are black and white and Latino and Asian and rich and poor\nAnd living in the interior live on the coasts everybody shares in him for political correctness and this is something that is stunning and there is a new study that a yes or monk over at Harvard has written about yes Harvard we'll we'll get to that in just a moment\nAnd uh there's something else that uh I I think should unite Americans but maybe doesn't yet which is a fear of another impeachment crisis I mean Democrats are making more and more serious and more and more credible saying if we win the house of representatives let alone the Senate\nWe're going forward with impeaching Brett Kavanaugh we're going forward with impeaching President Trump\nIs that a good idea will talk to one of the people who was central to the last impeachment crisis we had his name as a judge Ken Starr he uh was in charge of the investigation that led to the impeachment\nOf Bill Clinton\nWhat are the lessons for today's political world and what lessons for Robert Mueller who's playing the same kind of jobs that are that the Ken Starr function in back in the Nineteen nineties one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nOn this issue of political correctness first I there's this amazing piece in or the Atlantic of all places in the Atlantic is not a conservative journal headline Americans strongly disliked this like PC culture and\nThis is stunning\nIn the way that it shows that hatred for contempt for resistance to political correctness brings together everybody\nA um\n... what what they write about is this is if you look at what Americans have to say on issues such as immigration the extent of white privilege\nAnd the prevalence of sexual harassment there distinct clusters that emerge progressive activists traditional liberals passive liberal politically disengaged moderates et cetera et cetera okay one of the things is fascinating here is people who are traditional conservatives\nFar outnumber those who say they're progressive activists by twenty five percent or conservative eight percent or progressive activists\nBy contrast the two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either extreme constitute an exhausted majority their members share a sense of the tea with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible and their political viewpoints L A lack of voice in the national conversation\nI think that's exactly right and you can count me\nAh yeah I I mean I I Would probably be grouped together with the twenty five percent who are devoted conservatives they say traditional conservatives but they're certainly elements sometimes you feel like part of an exhausted majority\nAnd then they go on to the right they say most members of this exhausted majority remember that's eighty percent of the public and then some dislike political correctness among the general population full eighty percent believe that political correctness is a problem in our country\nEven young people are uncomfortable with it\nIncluding Seventy four percent between the ages of twenty four and twenty nine and of those under twenty four Seventy nine percent and that means the people who most resent political correctness who think it's a problem in our country or the people are having a shoved down their throats it's not working\nAnd why is this why is this resentments so common and\nBy the way who what racial group resents political correctness most remembers eighty percent of everybody\nYang white people you're on the\nUh racial group that most resents political correctness is American Indians a second or Hispanics Hispanics have political correctness an Asian\nThey hurried I'm political correctness or even more than white people do\nBlack people Seventy five percent resent political correctness think it's a problem the country and this piece in the Atlantic quotes a forty year old American indian and Oklahoma who participate in a focus group is part of this project and it's interesting project\nBut uh\nThis American indian again forty years old said it seems like every day you wake up something has changed you say Jew or Jewish is that a black guy or African American you have to be on your toes because you never know what to say so political correctness in that sense it's scary\nThree quarters of African Americans opposed political correctness this means that they're only four percentage points less likely than whites and only five percentage points less likely than the average to believe that political correctness is a problem okay uniting blacks and whites and young and old\nCan we say no to political correctness\nAnd that goes for political correctness even in San Francisco or this is an amazing story about someone named Steve on don't say Steven his name is Steve on S. T. V. O. and\nHe is the new president of the San Francisco Unified School district and they've had a long standing tradition for the San Francisco Unified School district\nA tradition of I'm beginning each public meeting saying the pledge of allegiance well no more\nInstead the first meeting that Steve on ... presided over as president San Francisco Unified School district sounded like this\nLike tonight we started this me to get out of the claim American writer and activist Maya Angelou who wants to when you learn teach when you get give [noise]\nSection ... is accessibility to information for public section B. opening items approval of four minutes for September twenty fifth twenty I think of it ... motion the second please Selma certain ... Scott stuff\nOkay and then they go forward and demeaning\nOr no pledge of allegiance and instead a a phony quote why do I say it's a funny quote the Washington Post have actually looked at this uh this quote that has allegedly from Maya Angelou the only source\nFor believing that she ever said it was that Oprah Winfrey a\nSet at that Maya Angelou said it but there's no record that you have a road that are set it or anything like that and by the way what does it mean when you learn teach when you get give\n'em a ... I'm not sure what that means okay here's the story of Steve on cook he's a young man he grew up in public housing\nHe did very well in school he went to Williams College very exclusive high ranking liberal arts college in Massachusetts and um then he came back to San Francisco he's involved in a number of social initiatives and gum self elected school board is now the school board president\nBut he said the um\nThe move dropping the pledge of allegiance and instead of calling Maya Angelou was not a demonstration in the vein of Colin Kaepernick another San Francisco bureau in quotes uh he says I was looking for creative ways to express admiration for the people that make the country what it is\nHe told the San Francisco ... chronicles of the current current political climate was disappointing and if the Trump Administration has quote been attacking our liberties\nOkay you can you can say all kinds of things about the Trump Administration where it's been the Trump Administration been attacking liberties\nI hadn't heard that before what what liberties exactly is the Trump Administration attacked one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then he said I don't spend much time thinking about President Trump yeah I think that's probably true he says although there is\nA requirement that schools conduct a pledge or similar activity there is no such requirement for school boards that was the statement from the district spokeswoman whose name is Lauren ... neck a no one in the audience of beer to mind\nCooks new introduction of course not at San Francisco and now they are planning on having other quotes from other worthy\nIs this one hundred year old memorial is to people who died in World War one no one is alive who fought in World War one\nBut\nSomehow this lawsuit estate alive they've been protesting this memorial for years and now on a divided court chief judge Roger Gregory uh well\nHe actually dissented from the majority opinion said nearly a century ago Maryland citizens out of deep respect and gratitude took on the daunting task directing a monument to mirror the measure of individual devotion and sacrifice these heroes had so noble e achieved\nThe panel majority says their effort violates the constitution\nThe soldiers fought to defend I respectfully think otherwise\nIt is outrageous and one of the points that has raised an important column by a Jeremy ... is one of the lawyers involved in this case is not too far away from this monument and Maryland is Arlington National cemetery\nAnd is this decision stands up it won't it's going to go to the U.S Supreme Court and there will be probably a seven to two decision against the stupidity the story here as private citizens decided to honor people from that community who died in World War one\nBy creating a monument in their honor\nAnd putting it up with public subscriptions that was not using taxpayer money it was all paid for by donations they put up this monument to honor the war dead\nAnd now if this court decision stands the monument would have to be removed destroyed or defaced to a race to cross\nThis is outrageous and it's why\nThe judicial issues are so important let's go to Rick in Los Angeles Rick you're on the Michael ...\nThanks so much like we're taking my call I have a couple of ... you know on this issue that you brought up first of all the gentleman in San Francisco who thinks that their freedoms are being attacked I I Love this about ... you know all you have to do now is this a worry\nWith those views that they hold and all of a sudden it's become an attack right that's how they would know this is absolutely it\nAnd the other examples you're bringing I mean you know thank our wonderful a higher education system\nWe all we have this now hate America embarrassed for America anything old and traditional like the constitution\nBut yet it is is outdated now we have to form a New America which you know the almighty less phony moral list and Supreme that they think they are they're going to shape a new American\nWhat your bed you're exactly right but this gives us an opportunity and the opportunity is based upon this other study that I threw into the mix which is a very profound\nStudy will get to more of that it doesn't matter whether you're white or black for older young rich or poor or liberal or conservative Americans have had an uptick here with political correctness so time to rally the troops on this issue how we'll talk about and coming up with your calls ...

touching story and as laid out by Jeremy this was one of the lawyers or who is involved with this fight he's representing the American legion the name of the cases American Legion versus American humanist association\nAnd he talks about his lowly corporal Milton Edward Hartman death shouldn't have drawn much attention but on a summer day in Nineteen Nineteen it seemed as if half the town of ... ville Marilyn came to his memorial service his commanding officer attended as did the bishop of Washington\nAs the churchman per periodically periodical reported on July nineteenth Nineteen Ninety and the whole countryside came to the memorial service throngs of church and filled the church are ten feet deep around the church listening and participate in the open doors and windows\nThe reason so many people came as they were dedicating this new memorial which now has been court ordered to be either demolished\nOr moved\nCan I just ask a question what kind of person devotes time and energy to taking down memorials two dead soldiers\n\nI don't get it I I honestly do not understand the the state of mind that would lead someone to be so imbued with hatred for this country and our traditions resume viewed with hatred for Christianity then\nI I mentioned that look everybody in America dislikes political correctness though the one group of Americans where opposition to political correctness falls below Seventy percent is that uh people with postgraduate degrees\nIn other words we have a master's degree or a PHD or an MBA degree or a law degree or I guess it even counts if you have an MSA a master and fine arts whatever you happen to have if you have a ... graduate degree then you are more likely to accept political correctness they'll get\nThis it's still sixty six\nPercent of people with postgraduate degrees a political correctness is a problem makes me uncomfortable eighty percent of everybody's sixty six percent of people with postgraduate degrees doesn't

because again part of what happens is part of the most one of the most dangerous things with the left does support on and you know this is they will take the text of the constitution which has been very clear meaning\nAnd they'll pull it twisted and distorted move it away for instance there's nothing in the constitution that would even whisper a suggestion\nThat you cannot bury people or cannot have a war memorial the people that has across on it that's just completely absurd\nAnd there's nothing that mentions the term separation of church and state that comes from a private letter that

the African American and Hispanic that didn't really like to go correctness and I think the reason behind it is it's the looting of what racism actually is\nLike you go back a during the revolutionary war period and stuff like that were racism was running rampant or being winch and you talk about it racism now where someone tweak something that's a little bit inappropriate they say everything's great says\nNo no I think I think you're making a very good point it's one of the reasons the Jewish people are very sensitive when people describe everything else as a Holocaust\nOr would you do by saying that by saying I remember ... did in a big argument for not eating chicken and uh they said don't eat chicken at the Holocaust on your plate do you remember this we had we had ... gone from pizza\nIt's absurd okay you may be opposed\nTo slaughtering chickens I don't eat chicken personally\nBut I Am the comparison between slaughtering chickens and slaughtering human beings is obscene and

this this ongoing attempt to try to attack war memorials I'm no one's been bitten on that's if there's somebody out there you still have a few moments\nThis whole if you think it's a good idea and it's appropriate to spend taxpayer money to dismantle a war memorial because has across inscribed on it and you have to take it down where you have to raise the cross somehow and finally this this

prospect of a new democratic move for impeachment impeachment Brett Kavanaugh impeachment of President Trump for if you're concerned about what's happening with the Mueller investigation or if you're concerned about\nThe Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation there is extremely relevant material on all of that in contempt\nIs subtitled a memoir of the Clinton investigation the author is Ken Starr and a judge star I've I've got to tell you this book is so reasonable it is so relevant and some of the revelations are\nMost a sensational unsatisfying and uh the the book is posted at our website at Michael med dot com\nIn writing it\nAnd then the response to the book which has been overwhelming since it's come out what's surprised you most\nOf what surprised me very positive way is that the Clinton a spin machine has remained silent\nAnd I said I said and and I don't mean that to be unkind but the of the Clinton spin cycle is Howard Kurtz that of the Washington Post style but [noise]\nUh was extraordinarily busy and energetic and some would say highly effective\nAt a uh taking a an issue with what seems to me to be indisputable\nAnd that is the facts and so I'm very pleased about that the other thing Michael I Would say is that there's so many eerie echoes from the past that we are hearing today and you mentioned to impeachment that's very high on the list because as you though a impeachment was extraordinarily controversy\nJill in the nineties and yet some of those crying for impeach but now with some of the most vociferous voices saying how dare you the\nUh the book is called contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation or Hillary Clinton doesn't come off are so very well in your book\n[noise] yes and uh you know turn the other cheek and uh and kindness to others and so forth but it's just the facts and and and and the facts are are are in sort of the day new mall was when we and the investigation seriously considered presenting an indictment\nOr to the federal grand jury and little log naming Hillary Rodham Clinton alone for her crimes in connection with\nThe Little Rock Arkansas face of the investigation in addition a during the course of interviews with her at the White House\nShe stood in such complete contrast in terms of relational skills and the like with her spouse Bill Clinton who of course is immensely charming and charismatic and a empathy at all the rest of it and she said as I say in the book\nSeemed to be just sort of deliberately in your face a A R massive\nA failure of recollection not only strain credulity Michael we chose to that by the time we assessed all of her answers we knew that she was ah she was lying under oath\nFainting or a failure recollection there was so colossal so profound that it simply could not have been true\nOkay you clearly believe a and I know because you had this house where it would be a mistake to pursue for Democrats or to pursue impeachment proceedings\nAgainst a either a justice Kavanaugh who used to work with you or against President Trump or why why would that be such a destructive course for the country and and I need you can relate that to some of the lessons in your book contempt\nYes Michael it goes back to the structural protections built into the constitution to prevent mob rule as we heard Senator Cornyn during the Kavanaugh\nHearings so to speak about law rule which seem to be the disorder of the day and the dystopia that we all experience to work stoned out\nBut the founding generation wanted a and demanded a super majority a requirement in the Senate a simple majority of the house the people's house should put the issue in the play\nAt their discretion so the majority ... cent articles over but then\nThere needs to be a bipartisan consensus that the practical political message and the two thirds super majority requirement a embodied in our constitution so don't go there there's just no reason there's no justification other than\nTo further divide the country\nIf that's the goal let's just divide the country even even more let's do what the Russians\nWere paying on their owners amount of money and attention to to do and continue to do is just continue to sow discord\nA and rancor among the American people that would be the eventual a result and and ice experience that and obviously we learn from our experiences and while I was not advocating in each one I was simply putting the facts of the Clinton investigation\nBefore the house of representatives\nAnd while I thought it was a perfectly reasonable action by the house of representatives wants the articles arrived at even before that it was very clear that the American people through the United states said it was just\nThey were not willing to go so far as to upset an election over these clearly establish climbs\nNow if clearly establish crimes such as perjury and obstruction of justice and the like are not sufficient to remove an individual from office that\nThere is absolutely nothing\nThat we know of that President Trump has done and leave injustice capital side\nFor the for the moment that he has done that rises took a level as I see it if it if each of the fence so I think it's a the the book and it's on why is a cautionary tale be careful before you marched down the road peach\nOh lord speaking with Ken Starr he is the author of contempt and then more of the Clinton investigation\nHe had been has pointed special prosecutor and it was still special prosecutor in that special counsel and he's one of the most distinguished attorneys and jurists and legal thinkers in our country\nHe um had been appointed to the federal court of appeals by President Reagan he was solicitor general under President George Herbert Walker Bush\nHe also served as president of Baylor University and as a dean of the Pepperdine University law school the book contempt is posted up at our website at Michael ... dot com\nYou were talking before about the need for bipartisan consensus in any I drive for impeachment of anybody is going to be successful and are\nThere did appear to be some attempt by about two senators I I can name they were both Democrats at the time and the impeachment crisis\nI Know that a Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Dianne Feinstein a of um of California I Believe had had both been involved with the idea of promoting censure\nOr a resolution of censure and that could have passed the Congress don't you think\n[noise] yes I think a resolution of censure condemning the crowds of a crime or the violation of basic principles of the precepts of the rule of law\nWould have passed overwhelmingly not unanimously but a overwhelmingly I think it would have exceeded a two thirds majority of cars were given a principled an elegant way out\nYeah and and uh why why was ... who made the determination because it wasn't you who made the determination not to accept the resolution of censure and then to go on with the people's business\nFor a number of arguments were Vance to the fact that the constitution of contemplated impeachment and so it was either impeachment or nothing\nAnd as I reflected on this constitutional issue I respectfully disagree with that and therefore would say that in the conversation that may or unfold and twenty ninth team that those who are crying impeachment impeachment\nIf their grounds for condemning and I'm saying if they're ... grounds for condemning the president but it's it's a foregone conclusion that impeachment will not succeed\nAnd that the the ... the United states will complete his term of office will seek reelection et cetera et cetera\nThen a resolution of censure strikes me is completely and the discretion of the Congress there's nothing so let me turn the tables on the argument there is nothing in the constitution structurally or textural light that forbid or prohibit or the\nSenate or the house are both from expressing his opinion at the sap probation and it ... past all the time and uh\nThat could be something that President Trump faces judge Kavanaugh justice Kevin a\nDay and age thing uh in northern Virginia and Pentagon City she said using very foul language to her mother who was encouraging her Monica to\nCooperate with the investigation and take yourself out of harm's way that she was not going to bring down this and she is very strong language cries of the uh and then she said that course for five months and I'm the president for his part insists that of course that he\nHad told the truth and his or her jury is a deposition\nAnd the Paula Jones case so the combination of the ... city of Bill Clinton under oath and the stubborn refusal of Monica for five months to cooperate with the investigation just hurt us and the nation through this very hellish\nPurgatory old process\nSpeaking in the hell is in purgatory process\nI'm ... I I'm I'm sure you've encountered a the current special counsel Robert Mueller he's quiet right now for awhile because it's just a few weeks before the upcoming election and I guess the tradition I for somebody in that position as you don't break any news right before an election\nI Would you have some national advice for special counsel Robert Mueller about how to handle the conclusion of his investigation based on your experience that you described in contempt\nYes I Would say that the regulations that are which she was appointed\nBy a Rod Rosenstein point the way to a very happy resolution once he comes to let the inclusion and I think he has on me the wrong and I don't know but I think he has concluded that there was no collusion\nBetween the Trump campaign and Russian interests\nUh that's why he was appointed obviously there's the Paul Manafort matters that Rick Gates matter the indictments of the Russian individuals and organizations which really do touch on reason that he was appointed bring this to an orderly conclusion and a professional way as quickly as possible\nAnd then happily this is a huge improvement my all over the independent counsel statute of under which I was appointed and that is\nThe regulations in which a model was appointed to not speak of impeachment was a powerful dynamic in the independent counsel law that Congress passed in Nineteen Seventy eight to nudge\nThe process toward impeachment\nThat's where we're going God willing and uh and you'll understand why that's so important when you read content a memoir of the Clinton investigation Ken Starr has been in public servant all his life and I admire him greatly the book is also admirable we'll be right back [noise]\nMichael\nMichael ... am nine twenty theater\n[noise] for that sort of news on by new way of Washington a Turkish court has convicted at American pastor but as allowing him to leave\nTurkey that's unanswered prayers many have been concerned about pastor Andrew Brunson including President Trump now for several months who's been calling out turkey to release him calling charges against him that he was involved with the terrorists bought nonsense and simply on through the national hurricanes ... by Israel Michael now post tropical psych wants me to go\nOver the Atlantic ocean by going to remain a very large storm tropical storm force winds had to be extending outward for\nMore than two hundred and fifty miles from its setter apply flooding can still take place in some areas like the\nCarolinas after two days of steep losses on Wall street something of a recovery today the Dow Jones industrial average was up two hundred and eighty seven points twenty five thousand three hundred and thirty nine that as that goes up by one hundred and sixty this is as a new\nA nine twenty the answer had the opportunity to sit down and talk with candidate for governor Brian Kemp the headline\nAnd he AJC recently again you took big bucks for people you regulate\nYou know there's no need to get into that story 'cause it is fake news is not through Patrick Greco gave me one contribution you know the AJC failed to right now or so like news continues to live on but look what the listeners should focus on is that all these attacks by the left\nOr a distraction from their candidates record of nothing that\nYou know she's made a million dollars over the last five years\nHe was able to loan campaign fifty thousand dollars yet she has the hour is that for a thousand dollars so she has put in politics\nAhead of you know doing her duties as a taxpayer money to go\nTo Saturday and one PM on AM nine twenty the answer to the\nBrought to you by the Home Depot the next generation of home improvement has everything you need to do projects smarter faster and for less every day the Home Depot more saving more doing\nFace and Dan Rather than face I live in science friday Night Football in the spotlight this week is on young Americans Christian schooling Conyers on line at Y.

I Believe more than any senatorial campaign now in history it's which raised more money\nAnd it's a campaign that's going to lose I Am very confident going to lose deserves to lose its a campaign for ... in Texas and the un congressman who's running against Ted Cruz it I just took a look at the polls\nThey all show Ted Cruz up up substantially up six points nine point seven points it's in that range\nBut debate or work just announced that he had raised thirty eight million dollars for what I bet there are some people are listening to may have contributed a debate or works campaign\nIf you've spent money to this guy called me and tell me why one eight hundred nine five\nFive Seventeen Seventy six here is in a tape that he prepared Beto O'Rourke thanking his four diluted followers\nAs hard as they come in and say things you where's your whole we've raised more than ... million dollars over these last three months that came from eight hundred thousand eight hundred and thirty six unique\nContributions is going to give us the resources we need to lose his campaign as strong as we possibly can\nAnd it's more than three times you know\nThe cruise is not just in his campaign but all the affiliated political action committees that are contributing to this thing\nWe're doing something absolutely historic not just a short and we have the resources to run and win but to make sure that our democracy once again it's powered by people in the only people people over special interests people overpower people over super got people over corporation people insured\nBut Michael thank you for taking my call you bat\nSo there's going to a positive thing that you have come out of work for the ... campaign contributions\nAnd that is because as you say you're not going away in any way but it's going to be yet another example of people who believe so fervently the Citizens United carrying the big money always when it's going to the book that one more time\nFavorite ... knocked off Eric Cantor being outspent cook like twenty to one I Would argue it causes your Cortez spent by Joe Crowley by rep at the same origins and she obviously one\nUm so once again we're

decline marginal utility which was the case of Iraq would be a hero you know stop during good money after bad\nIs that you you're entirely correct and it's a very very smart point and let me add to it and there's another thing I think it's a beautiful thing about sending money to bed or rock and I do want to say\nA for people out there who are dyed in the wool Democrats uh keep sending your money to ... it's a really great way place to put your money because it's absolutely harmless there Ted Cruz is going to win that race\nAnd it's much better to send money to pay into than to send it to some some of those swing state Democrats where it actually might make a difference a\nAnd then I appreciate your call and and by the way the best example of money not determining the election\nIs uh\nIn in the campaign Hillary Clinton outspend Donald Trump more than two to one and this is if you take all of the sources and all the money and all of a special funding or ... or was not by any means the leading span during the primaries\nHe defeated all kinds of primary opponents who spent more money than he did\nAnd this whole legend that you can buy elections\nIt's not so easy\nLet's go to your

that was at a Red Sox are tough though but we'll see\nWe'll see but anyhow um I think uh myself I kind of what you said I think they do is really running for president and this was just practice hill a you'll have all that big bank roll a leftover when he was doing no way to spend thirty\nEight million dollars I mean now and November he could be built some daycare centers\nThat he can build part of the law\nOr there you go [laughter] that'd be popular that his base would love that [laughter] where to save I'll go Sam money I'll build the wall go ahead [laughter]\nWhy those are just my thoughts I thinking just practicing for president somebody in the very the California money has got him thinking that he's got a chance at some time in the future and you've got to get his campaign or chops and uh\nBut you know here's here's here's the thing what they're trying to do is they're trying to compare him to Lincoln and I'll tell you why Lincoln was a congressman just for one single term\nAnd then he ran for Senate and he lost they lost an Eighteen fifty eight but he did such a good job running for Senate that he became the Republican nominee next year now the Democrats are saying hey mate or Rourke he's a congressman and now he's running for Senate and yeah he's going to lose but just like Abraham\nLincoln there's one difference Abraham Lincoln was monumental lead brilliant and uh somebody of of deep deep integrity a bait or Rourke come on appreciate your call Mike in Cleveland you're on the ... that show\nLike go to a federal thing I mean there is much more attractive I mean you know more attractive than Ted Cruz are you crazy cruise comes off like a big rock metal and I'm tired of all that stuff that's quite I think they all kind of a better chance than you are posters think a lot of people ...\nOkay I I Can't imagine why people would would lie in\nTexas to I Am in any event to say that that they're not going to be voting for better or when they are secretly look the point about this is a you know Ted Cruz takes a lot of gas because of his appearance\nBut he's somebody who's worked extraordinarily hard for his state and after losing the presidential contest with President Trump\nHe um he has come back and he has been a constructive player in the Senate and you can talk to even people use to make fun of Ted Cruz most hated man in the Senate\nHe's actually somebody who's won all kinds of respect from all of his fellow Republicans and many of his Senate Democratic colleagues\nAnd uh I honestly it will be very good just

here on earth not on the moon involving some people from outer space who brought their children to Washington DC\nAnd in the midst of a the ongoing protests about Brett Kavanaugh yep that's still going on these are women who brought their children along I made the mistake for them or by getting into the face of Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana\nAnd it sounded like this\nCat sneaky sees

you for not believing women and for ruining my daughter's life\nSome of them want to explain that how did a senator Cassidy\nYes he voted for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh as did fifty of his colleagues well actually the revolt was only recorded for a forty nine of his colleagues because one of them was often his daughter's wedding but they had fifty one votes in the Senate\nTo confirm Brett Kavanaugh and that's a shame and it describes it they didn't have more but there wasn't a there was only one Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia who is willing to actually bucked his party and by the way I think by doing so Joe mansion probably has helped his own reelection chances enormously\nWhat what is this the idea of the center Cassie why are you destroying my children's future my
