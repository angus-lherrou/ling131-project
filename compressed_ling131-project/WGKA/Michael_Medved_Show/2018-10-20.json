coach a good that's good to be with you and it's always exciting time around Clemson it's homecoming it's also you know breast cancer awareness month so believe are going to be wearing some pain is a weekend or just exciting times around campus\nIt is I I Love home come and they just got to it just takes me back to when I was a player you know in in college days and\nThe enthusiasm on campus seeing it you know it would last night the winds air she'd be Wednesday night I went to um uh the Bowman field there where they build all the floats and got a chance to walk around and\nIt just kind of take in the energy of our students and and the brilliance of our students and the stuff that they built it's unbelievable how they put this stuff together and the money that they spin they raise this money\nAnd then ... just very good decision making by him\nSo ah you know that's going to be a challenge they got an all American candidate left tackle that battle between you know clearly in in fifty three left tackle is going to be a great one to watch and\nAnd uh same thing with Austin and and the right tackle and those guys inside so we want to definitely try to see if we can double that stat at least a in this ball game 'cause I think our ability to pressure him\nAnd make him have to maybe get rid of even earlier that he wants a will allow us to to be better in coverage on the back in a so it's a but you can't just throw one pitch him he he's too good you got you got to be diverse in your plan diverse in your coverage is in your pressure packages\nI'm and I'm I think that ah Britain the guys who put a great plan together and you know they're looking forward to this challenge\nNC State had four defensive lineman take it in the top one hundred and twenty five picks of the draft last year yet they've been outstanding a defense given up less the Seventeen points again\nYeah they're they're pretty much kind of one or two and everything in our legal Ross in them you know if you pretty much look at all the statistics a you know they they have not ... the quarterback at quite as much as they did last year uh but I don't think they sacked us last year and the game I think we only had one negative play of maybe three yards but\nAnd that's going to be a huge thing that was a big factor force last year we actually blocked them pretty well from a protection stand point\nA to give us a chance because I didn't think we played well defense with I should probably our worst game of the season last year was it gets in the state\nUh so there's a lot of there's a lot of uh uh attention and focus that these guys because I think they respect him and uh and and they they know that uh\nWe did not play our best last year still found a way to win a but they are they we want to come out of this thing winning the game but we want to we want to do it playing very well\nCoach good luck to they should be a great Dane football looking forward to\nThis had been at friday
