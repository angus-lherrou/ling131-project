Mesa, Arizona you feel that a Saudi Arabia's much worse than he ran\n[noise] so I'm In a nutshell 'cause we don't have a lot of time but he's react to my theory or my belief that Iran is much worse than Saudi Arabia because he ran is a far greater\nDanger to the west\nAnd to Israel and Saudi Arabia is which is a danger more to itself although I fully acknowledged the Saudi contribution to a fundamentalist awful madrassas around the world so on what grounds do you think otherwise\nThe group that did nine eleven was from Saudi Arabia the um the money you know the ones that\nAre willing to come from Saudi Arabia to\nYeah okay I don't know I don't know what rumors of ... that would have been in Saudi Arabia was not prices\nAre now that we're not what they were pro going against Iran Syria\nAnd right now it turns out that right before this particular election of President Trump's approval rating according to a new Wall Street journal NBC News poll as being heavily covered on CNN\nAnd everywhere in mainstream media President Trump's approval rating is the highest it's ever been okay don't get too excited is forty seven percent\nBut forty seven percent to forty nine percent disapproval it means that President Trump has actually closed the gap between disapproval an approval is now basically tied the Americans or even evenly split\nAnd one of the things that I found stunning I Am by the way in the midst of a battleground talkers tour I'm tonight in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [noise]\nUh and uh then on Thursday I'll be home God willing in between and on Thursday I'm going to be in Minneapolis where there are also some very hot congressional races and the governor's race in Senate races and more but right now it's\nAll so tight your vote really really matters\nOne of the things that I've found stunning is that um I was watching CNN in the airport when I had to change planes about six this morning in Washington DC I flew from Seattle, Washington DC and from there to Pittsburgh and um\n[noise] in the airport that Tom Perez on who is the Democratic national chair and uh\nThey showed in the new numbers about Trump soaring approval rating\nAnd I asked him why and he had no idea he couldn't answer it\nAnd the answer is very obvious is that Americans have gotten used to Trump\nThey um and most Americans like the economic situation we're in President Trump gets very very good marks on the economy and for most people the economy is the most important part of the job\nA meanwhile with an election is close vote fraud is a huge problem we will be talking about that later in the show there's a new book that suggests that it is far more common than people on the left ever wants to lead on and far more threatening and\nThere is also a um an issue lurking in the deep background which is the issue of marijuana we did um a segment on the show\nA couple of weeks ago about a um a guy who said look I'm just a normal I'm middle aged a stay at home dad\nWho almost ruined his life through marijuana addiction\nAnd this individual by the way is for legalized marijuana\nIs going to be joining us on the show to tell his story and to answer your questions or to take your comments that all coming up on the Michael mad vigil one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nIf you can answer the question that a Tom Perez could not answer why President Trump's approval rating would be going up so dramatically the last couple of weeks [noise]\nHonestly part of it as the Kavanaugh situation part of it is the caravan situation anybody here who thinks that we should simply opened the gates\nAnd as lead in all the people from the caravan\n... even those of us who support him ... immigrants and immigration reform and I support immigrants that I support immigration reform\nThe idea of simply saying that you get seven thousand people together and they're marching to the United states and they're all waving Honduran flags well of course you let 'em in because they're having a tough time in Honduras or there are a lot of suffering people right\nBut the notion that that uh\nUh that that somehow one of the Democrats said about this what is the right thing to do\nI think the right thing to do is to make it clear that before they walk the other two thousand miles they have left to walk before they get to the United states border they get a very very clear idea of a President Trump and most other Americans who actually can think about this with anything like an open mind\nAre going to say no this is not a good idea\nYou don't simply a let people into the United states without authorization without security clearances or then have them flood the system for processing asylum applications one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nMeanwhile somebody who seems to have a position on everything\nBut I don't really think he has a position on the caravan because how could he is a battle or Rourke\nAnd one of the questions I Would ask here\nIs what is so great about Beto he is he is now inspired people\nThis the Democratic nominee for US Senate against Ted Cruz President Trump is going down to campaign for the guy who once called lion head and people say oh to Trump such a hypocrite this happens in politics all the time\nPeople who were opponents to run against each other then come together and work together\nIt happens all the time of Ronald Reagan and George ... a age W. Bush George W. Bush running in the primary against Ronald Reagan in Nineteen eighty attacked him pretty partially he said the Reagan was practicing voodoo economics\nAnd then later he embraced Abu to economics a Reagan chosen to be as vice president and\nThey honored and came to like each other or this is\nAll remarkable what is going on that the election is so close but that hasn't stopped people from breaking into song\nOver the great Robert O'Rourke that's his real name known as bait so the Democratic wonder boy of this election cycle who was inspired melodies like this\nA passion for rent them God\nReally shown and by\nGuy is totally [noise]\n\nOn the mega burned by turning back the smooth\nNow and [noise] down and\nRead we can't pot sales [noise] mean\nMen no mom you\nTell them that little little bit [noise]\nOkay the last time I think that anyone sort of inspired this many songs\nAre in a campaign was President Trump you remember we spent several days playing the various Trump songs I like the one to get on the Trump train 'em in any event the better our work\nAnd the the ... to see about that token someone explained to me\nWhat it is exactly that is so inspiring to people about ...\n... what it is that the ... the soul and and makes people so excited that even though he is almost certainly going to lose his challenge to Ted Cruz who's been a decent hardworking senator and\nHe's a conscientious and substantive conservative\nAnd by the way you know so much more about the issues and then ... ... what is it the better our work is going to do for the country that inspires reactions like this and and basically with ABC News telling him he's not just the candidate\nHe's a rock star listen I'm\nObvious strategies that I've seen them more\nA modern Ken very literate show off\nYou can be without an interruption in from the battle back much I Love your thinking well you\n\n\nOkay um [noise] or they're going to be a lot of disappointed folks in Texas are coming up on election day Fifteen days from now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number of President Trump\nHas his own response see as a new video out about are the Democrats offering mom's not jobs or we will get to that and uh we will get to\nWhat the election comes down to there is also a a a a very alarming peace in the New York times at least it's meant to be alarming I didn't think it sounded so bad\nIt's by David Leonhardt and it's what if the Republicans when everything\nThe fact that the New York times even thinking about that that shows you which side has momentum at the moment we will be right back on the Michael med show with your calls [noise]\nMichael [noise] when he was written by by ...\nBut I think he could be very charismatic and he could extend that magic to the country in the early primaries\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a bay toe performing and that is a performance is sort of a performance art as they say when he was doing a town hall in or\nNear El Paso which is where he's from and you know very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN [noise]\nAnd uh she she asked him very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively\nThat it leads me to believe that you\nKnow he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he rules out\nPretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race is going to want to spend some more time with his family of course they all say that um\n[noise] and some of that it might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race was he was pushed and pushed\nOn the fact that he has said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice inclusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now\nAnd he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it\nHe is for impeachment he he believes even before the smaller investigation is wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nAnd yes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish but needs to fish but better or doesn't think so he agrees with a lot of people in the far right the ... just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets him up well for a future presidential run or anything of the time hey I appreciate your call\nUm I I'm a\nI Will get back to this and to David Leonhardt piece what if the Republicans when everything will we now know President Trump has made a couple of statements and I think one of them at least to sort of\nFlummoxed some of his age uh there's talk about another tax cut\nThat may be announced before November first that's soon and very soon\nA and he says it's that people are going to love it it's going to be a big middle tax a\nFlat

to that and we really it's a lot of our country or or or battle anywhere I called to talk about the uh the plan to Beijing\nYou are you calling the caravan of planned invasion\nYes sir\nWell eight I'm given the fact that we've had so far this year I think we've had about twenty times the number of illegal entries into the country this year the illegal entries are way up because the economy is very hot right now people are getting across and uh\nThis I'd only constitutes an invasion I think it is a challenge to our whole immigration system is basically an attempt to raise the border and say that uh we have to let anyone that wants to come in and most Americans don't believe that law doesn't say that\nSo [noise] but when you say ... and ... of planned invasion what do you have in mind\nUm I think it's just a part of the the war or the battle between conservatives and left us that are trying to take down America and this is the latest strategy\nExcept if you look at those people and I've seen ... and of course they play a lot of very close compassionate a video showing some of these poor people\nWho I think are hungry or scared I'm hopeful ah they they do not appear to be\nActors or manipulated their just desperate people from\nPlaces in the world that are deeply deeply dysfunctional look I I think the President Trump is doing the right thing to basically make a stand and to say no we simply cannot just open the doors to anyone in this country that's not going to be our immigration policy\nBut I think he makes a very big mistake when he threatens to cut off foreign aid and I'll tell you why\nThe best way to prevent other incidents like this and so this doesn't happen every week or every month\nIs not to cut off foreign aid to Honduras is to coordinate more foreign aid to Honduras to take these people these seven thousand people I think that's how many they think there are right now\nAnd to bring them back home where you can work with them to try to make Honduras some more livable place because that's really going to be the only kind of answer that has a long term impact or let's go to Marco in Los Angeles Marco you're on the method that show\nI might go a great job either way hey three things I was calling regarding that that the um the\nReporter that got killed I feel that that really not our crime it lots of guys get killed all over the place we're not we're not up in arms about it both sure it's a bad situation that happened but why are we getting involved country insolvent\nBecause we are and we are involved with the country I mean the the argument is we uh we have a lot of financial dealings with Saudi Arabia\nNow of Saudi Arabia is not a country we give foreign aid to their one of the richest countries in the world but it's a country that we sell a lot of arms to him as President Trump says we have a pending one hundred ten billion dollar arms deal and if it doesn't go through with us if we cancel it for some reason they'll turn around and by the arms from\nA China or Russia and why\n... why does that have to do what is that the deal with this guy can kill\nWell ... what's left is trying to do and I think it's despicable frankly is to suggest that somehow uh Mohammed bin Solomon the prince crown prince and Saudi Arabia got the idea that it was okay to kill reporters because President Trump is always so critical of the press\nAnd I think he ... obviously President Trump has never called on anyone to kill reporters\nAre and ... do I think it's unfortunate that President Trump made some reference and it was a joking reference to Greg Gianforte in one of the worst moments of his life losing his temper and slam slamming doing a body slam on a reporter yeah he shouldn't be making jokes about that a\nLet's uh go to

who said he thought this this mass caravan\nUp north was um he called it an invasion I don't think it's an invasion but when you said they looked scared hungry and cold I was like well I've seen the videos and maybe I'm maybe I'm seeing fake videos but these people seem coordinated\nThey seem 'em purpose for all and they seem they seem somewhat happy and I'm not getting that and\nCouple of weeks ago and we got a tremendous response most people were very positive at actually talked about how his experience mirrored their own the whole theme of his piece was he's a middle aged stay at home dad he's also\nThe greatest living American writer how do I know that because it says so right on his website and he certainly did do a great job writing that particular column Neal Pollack it's great to meet you over the phone\nThat hey Michael how are you\nHey I'm doing well I um I\nI I just wanted to ask you a day at the outset eat your piece was actually scary and sad and very honest and how how many years did you feel that you had a problem with marijuana\nWe it's hard to gauge how many years I actually had a problem I I smoked pretty regularly for more than two decades and I would say at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdid it\nSo a long time how do you know you over did it\nNow that I'm sober I can look back on some of the mighty have years when I was high and realize that uh\nThat pot was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having a public melt down either ... or even a getting into fights or I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done if I'd been sober you know and I also\nWasn't sleeping normally I I was I was ... and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time thinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume and about the consumers with\nAbout trips I could take that would revolver on marijuana and you know it's just kind of became the center of my life for very long time\nAnd this was during a period of time when you were making a pretty good career for yourself as a writer you or you've been married for a while right\nNow I've been married for Eighteen years and I have a son and the whole time I was still you know I was a you know basically like a professional hipster right up you'd I\nPublished a got published ten bucks\nI had a couple of a script deals in Hollywood I you know I've written for you know pretty much every English language publication ... except for the New Yorker you know it's it's not like I [noise] I was a um an ambitious donor or a failure but I I sometimes wonder\nHow much more successful I Would have been if I hadn't been soaked in marijuana the whole time and I I certainly would have a you know live my life is more integrity and and carried out by a my business affairs with what made it more efficiently and I also just would have been able to devote more time to my family\nHow long how long have you been sober a\nMy one year anniversary is November eleventh so I'm going to make it I'm pretty sure that I relapsed at them coming before that so I'll just say a year\nOkay well good for you or congratulations on that and what advantages do you see now that your non smoking pot on a regular basis\nYou know it's kind of ... because\nIn some ways marijuana was a creative force in my life I Would you know I I wrote almost all my book I all the time and I came although in retrospect there there's a lot of there are a lot of scenes in the novels that are about getting hot\nAnd I I think there'll be fewer of those but you know it it it helped me come up with certain like fancy indecent jokes um and he was a creative stimulant in some ways but uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative\nSince I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present for my family and my friends um I'm Better organized\nUm I I I Can't ... making more money but I\nFeel like my life is in order professionally in a way that it was good is that as much chaos and I'm and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows that was happening when I was using marijuana you know I'm not\nI'm not super up all the time and and then when I when I bought 'em out I don't bottom out it there's no there's no high or low like I said\nSo I'm not having those melt down that would characterize a sort of my my addiction cycle\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number ... speaking with Neal Pollack who wrote about how marijuana almost ruined his life is one thing you you mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years\nDid your wife ever share a year and says he has them for a living you\nKnow and in fact you know she says the opposite though she she has no interest in it at all um and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem or just you know I Would just ... I you know because the the ... is the marijuana is an addictive it in some ways it's considered a health food\nUm and so I just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism and my family um and obviously has the addiction gene I just it it it just didn't register with me\nUm maybe I should add you know there are ducking behind the dumpster on the weight walking to the gym it's like you know take a hit so like it'd be high wall was working out there that's not the signs of someone who is necessarily healthy but uh you know I just\nI ah I didn't see it she did and she she was so grateful when I finally made the decision to quit\nDoing it you use the figures in your in your piece that I I I think they're generally accepted figure there from the journal of the American Medical Association and based on studies done in a number of countries they suggest that ah some nine percent of people\nWho ever use marijuana end up getting addicted and Seventeen percent of people use marijuana is teenagers did you first use a weight as a teenager\nYeah I smoked once at a party when I was in high school but you know when I was when I was a teenager and this was you know the Nineteen eighties I was I was sort of a a\nGo getter do good or student council type sort of a modeling myself maybe not politically but like at least in terms of my lifestyle on you know Michael J. Fox is character from family guys died that was my model like I was going to a guy that I Would be successful I was going to be as great American citizens and\nUm and so part didn't really play into it\nUm you know in college I kind of um\nI I went a little uh I I I I'm a member of generation X and so you know I I I became kind of a a a grouchy pop culture sitting there but I still was doing a lot of drugs or it wasn't until I was in my twenties that I um that I really started a consuming it\nSo it was an adult onset addiction\nRight right I I had a view I'm ever tried to calculate how much money you invested in and buying lead over the years about\nOh I mean it was probably a few thousand dollars you know that the thing is it and you know and and this is is it a brag it's just the fact you know I there was a time there where I was a ... you know well known writer and people would just give me drugs or ... or smoke me up and I I'm I'm kind of I'm\nInherently cheap so I Would look for situations where I ... I knew I'd be around people who would have it so I wouldn't have to buy but of course I still would sometimes you know when I Lived in LA I had a medical marijuana card out you know I'd go up to Colorado for a week and it's been a hundred two hundred bucks so it didn't\nBankrupt me in that sense but\nIt you know it's still it was still even though the month where it was really good at managing was still caught me at least fifty dollars not a hundred bucks and I\nKnow you you you've written a since you've written this piece sentence obviously causing a great stir have you gotten so negative reaction from some of your old friends\nOr do people have been very supportive I've had a few people who are wonderful yeah\nYeah yeah I mean generally when someone announces that they're an addict the reaction is that like you're faking it or [laughter] you know you're ... it's not you know or or you're not an addict I mean if you if you go through what if you go through the twelve step program guided ... there's no way you can know\nAnyone can say that you're not an addict I mean I wouldn't have done it if I was it but uh you know there was some sort of anonymous emails and comments on line that\nSaid that there is no way without describing could possibly be true but that was fictionalized ... that I was somehow working with reactionary forces who want to contribute to the drug war\nBut those comments were\nMinor five percent most\nPeople were you make it you make it very clear in your in your column that you believe that marijuana should be legal given the fact that you recognize that it's dangerous a that's a fascinating position to take we will get to that and much more with Neal Pollack\nLink to his website as well he's um a written a powerful piece about marijuana addiction slowly ride back with your calls for Neal Pollack coming up\nTwenty five five seven genes Seventy six psalm Michael Bedford show\nHas to in order to help your life or in your life for me you know I didn't have to avoid that I was trying to fill a was marijuana we just kind of stumbled across to each other but certainly the creative aspect that maybe a little bit more on artistic side of the visuals side\nI feel that it's it's certainly a struggle and and my main question to your worst what\nOr for the show was what finally made you quit\nYeah that that's a good question and to address the thing you were saying it's like it's just marijuana is kind of creeps up on you right it's not like I'm you know heroin where your job if you get addicted very fast\nI'm Still ... you can use it for a number of years it's sort of a low level is gradually increases as for me that my moment of clarity game ... ironically enough\nNow that the Dodgers are back in the world series that actually came at the world series I when I went to Los Angeles and I always dreamed of going to a World Series game even though I didn't really have the resources to do it and I bought a ticket off of some ... third party Web site before I did that\nI managed to get as high as I possibly could um even though you know there's no reason why you need to get high and go to the world series but I needed to get high to do everything and that was a special occasion so I got really high um smoking the huge joint that has all this crystallized th ... all over like\nSmoking weed with a stranger and it has an echo park I went to the stadium\nBombed out on my mind and the ticket didn't scan it was it was like I said it was fraudulent 'em and rather than deal with the situation rationally I started screaming at people and I was on I almost got arrested I got it scored it out of the stadium\nOr by security guards that was in the parking lot sobbing and it's kind of took a look at myself into a side view mirror of a car and I just saw this you know old man with red rimmed eyes\nCrying over a baseball game and I just I thought to myself this isn't good\nSo I Can't go on and so I didn't quit that day but three weeks later I I kinda sunk in and I just took my last puff and\nKen Daniel more rounded up and vote can can you be around other people who were getting high uh

found in a new study the traffic accidents are rising in states that have already to legalize recreational marijuana\nThat follows dark warnings from the national Transportation Safety board which last week issues several recommendations to combat drug impaired driving and then Neal Pollack our guest wrote a piece for the drive where he says I'm\nPot is being touted as a cure for all human males in its negative effects are drastically underplayed but there is no greater negative to marijuana than driving stone as dangerous as hell if you really think it's safe to drive stone then you've either never been stone have never driven or lying to yourself\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nOr a Neal these these numbers look look fairly serious and I think\nOne of the big claims when we were going through the legalization debate in the state of Washington where I live\nWas that this would be so great because fewer people would be drinking and more people will be smoking weed but for first of all there's no reason to believe that smoking weed stumps people from drinking as they're\nAbsolutely not I mean I I was less of a drinker when I was getting stone but I Know I Know people who do both in in if they go together pretty well so now they're going to believe that but there you know the thing with driving while stoned right there were the other live in the\nIn the store to community that I'm actually um it's much deeper Dr stone than uh than drunk because you know when you're stone you you get paranoid and you're focused and you

and uh however he these candidates in those states don't do do do better than Trump they just need to do as well and\nThis would be very encouraging and it also brings up the point that when you read the generic polls nationally when they say well\nThe Democrats are have this big advantage and the generic poll [noise]\nThe reason that that doesn't matter as much as you might think it would it's the same reason it didn't matter alternately the Hillary won the popular vote by more than three well three million votes but you know what that was all in California\nAnd that's the point one of the reasons I think that Democrats may be doing well on the generic ballot\nThere are thirty six seats where there is no Republican candidate\nReally where it's just so like I I don't think Maxine Waters

well maybe it's to gin up a a democratic theft machine at least that's the allegation in a new book by Eric eggers it's a whole fraud it's about election fraud and he says we're in real danger of it will be speaking to him later this hour\nUm meanwhile\nI also want to hear from why this election is so important in the mind of someone who was speaking in Las Vegas just moments ago and it's a voice you might recognize listen\nNovember's election are more important than anything I can remember in my lifetime and that includes what I was on about [noise]\nPoliticians say every time the the most important election this one's\nThe stakes are high the consequences of anybody here not turning and doing everything you can to get your friends neighbors family to turn up the consequences of staying\nWould be profoundly dangerous to discover toward democracy\nOkay I I Can't believe that Obama President Obama is saying uh\nThis is the most important election of my lifetime and again everyone says that about every election and it's almost never true [laughter] really and this is a midterm election and it it will not be a landslide one way or the other\nAnd yes I think it's important and yes I think everybody should definitely vote because this will help to determine the directions of the country for the next two years but then we have another presidential election and I think one of the things that happens is we're all so desperate to get people to turn out\nAnd then when an election happens and there isn't some kind of profound change how people get disillusioned how often can you cry wolf about that stuff\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number a President Obama's successor was also speaking today and he had a a different tone he was speaking outside the White House and here's a President Trump said\nPutting in a resolution sometime next week or are we going to have to wait for the\nJob that says how well this is a little bit of that sort of the fact that we've already [laughter]\nNo no no no you\nDon't want to vote after the allies\nOkay I'm not I'm not sure this is going to work and what he's talking about is I'm trying to do a ten percent middle class income tax cut sounds pretty good but honestly I don't I don't think he will get the support he needs unless\nA and first of all he's right to say we're we're going to try to do the vote after the election when he's talking about now is a proposal to try to excite the Republican base in of course people should be excited about it you know how much money you\nSpend in taxes and getting ten percent of that back that's pretty cool that's a nice thing however\nHe can't do it honestly unless he finds some kind of compensating\nA place for money to come in because it it simply does not work does not work that when you cut the tax rate that automatically the revenues go up I mean it's true that the revenues didn't go down from the\nLast tax hike but because we're spending so much more than ... continue to go up we're already looking at a trillion dollar a year deficit\nAnd I think the president should work as hard as he can maybe after the election with a Republican House and the Republican Senate to try to yes continue to cut taxes\nBut to do so by cutting spending one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or in Nevada a President Trump spoke\nSaturday and he was talking and somewhat similar terms listen\nRelocate they earn your taxes are middle income people [noise]\nAnd we do that it will be some prior I Wish they would have ever had are setting the really right now around the block a major attack for middle income people not at all the different varieties working on it All right we're we're all working\nMay\nSay some time around\nThe okay one of the things that we need to keep in mind is they're already was a tax cuts for middle income people you may not be aware of it but you will and when you fill out your tax forms and everything because basically the exemption was doubled\nIn other words part of what we have now is that the standard deduction the standard deduction that people receive\nWas double which means that there's an extra twelve thousand dollars that people who are middle class taxpayers are not paying taxes on\nThat's a good thing and that should save a lot of money all ready for middle income people and\nI ... I think the timing of this I may be could be a little bit better\nAnd also President Trump did something that provoked a huge Lee negative response on CNN what's striking about this is not the light it sheds 'cause she has no light at all on President Trump's proposed actions concerning the federal government\nAnd trans gender is ...\nWhat's shocking about it as simple as me journalism and honestly these reporters on air uh are sounding completely an unapologetically partisan I'm Talking about John Berman\nAnd um and oh Alison ... and John Avalon on uh CNN listen to how\nThey react remember there was just over three years ago that same sex marriage became legal in this country\nSo now the wedge issue has moved to a trans right concern so I'd love to lock the issue of identity gender identity civilized by Facebook's dozens of gender options I'm also liberal abrasive myriad of gender pronouns for many conservatives in some moderate it's a potent example the PC culture the Trump constantly attacks to great effect\nRepublicans want to benefit from this backlash and it's an easy target just look at the numbers transgender folks make up an estimated zero point four percent of American adults work once when I saw a million people\nThat's still a lot of our fellow citizens but it's many fewer than a million of gay and lesbian Americans who most people now know was friends family your co workers\nThis just simply picking on minority rights to try to win the popular vote last time I checked self determination was a pretty basic American values rooted in freedom and equality\nWell President Trump has also been playing up the caravan of asylum seekers from Central America pushing it as a threat at rallies employees with plenty of application from conservative media this is just more play the bass addict rooted in fear and anger rather than any reality that these asylum seekers are going to rush the board\nOkay there let's say they don't rush the border\nWhat are they coming here to do they're they're coming here in Moscow to get into the United states and what they will do is flood our resources or submit applications for asylum\nAnd basically challenged this notion that the United states as a as a basically the core of our sovereignty gets to decide who comes into the country and who doesn't\nWe don't get to decide because we're not East Germany who leaves the country\nAnd people are free to leave\nBut this is this is bizarre this is um we have a can we go to this last a ... [noise] uh we don't have time\nOkay ah I ah I Know we will be speaking about this later frankly what President Trump is doing is not taking away anyone's rights what he's doing is taking away a federal government position I actually believe that the federal government's position on transgender asylum\nOr should be neutral and in other words don't persecuted people were transgendered but don't\nAll of a sudden presumptive leave claims is someone that is a woman just because he says so or someone is a man just because she says so [noise]\nThat's ridiculous [noise] I'll tell you what's ridiculous the idea of stolen election we will get to that the real threat of voter fraud coming up on the ... [noise]\nMy pillows now offer your specialty you buy one get one free go to my little dog\nIn twenty sixteen when they had six thousand people registered to vote on the same day in New Hampshire and they have these buses that come in from Massachusetts a neighboring state six thousand people voted but then didn't actually register a car or pick the follow up steps to suggest their actual New Hampshire resident\nSo those are a couple of recent examples but um you know but but some of the other things that happened I think\nThat document example you got mayor's races you got sheriff traces of the sheriff's rate in Florida that uh it's basically been proven to that they've had felons that had voted illegally but because the election basically been certified\nOr the suit the judge has ruled that well we have to give these fellows due process though that's not enough evidence brought invalidate\nIt happened a nationally\nSyndicated would would you say there's a certain amount of voter fraud in every state every election\n[noise] I I Would um because I think it really gets down to the below in the voter rolls I mean and this is something we experience I live in Florida and I've been having numerous interactions with the elections officials here and elsewhere because the the reality is the bias is\nTo let people vote right I mean no one wants to suppress illegal voter but\nBecause of that it's created a system of vulnerabilities\nThat I think are actively exploited by bad actors so I mean the the Texas Democrats mailing the the voter registration form is one example but you know you got groups like acorn ... and their whole job is to go out and Ralph's up as many voters\nAs possible regardless of the legality of those voters right you've got voted I should I no one drives\nIn one of the same way when things are one of the things that people seem to be interested in on the left as the idea that if you're a college student you can register both in your college and uh where where you live and then you vote twice\nThat illegal but that happens a lot doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean there's nearly three million people registered to vote in more than one state in the country or the Supreme Court sided views that are that says that says twenty four million voter registration is this country are completely wrong so that's one in eight by the way\nThat we know we've got massive problem and then the question is how easily are they exploited\nA gay as you say you have to Washington and we're going to face in just a moment with Eric Eyre eggers whose new book fraud how the left plans to steal the next election is posted up at our website\nQuestion that we're going to ponder is what do you do about it how can it be fakes how can we be protected we'll get to that and more with Eric eggers whose new book is called fraud how the left plans to steal the next election will be right back on the met that show\nMichael ...
