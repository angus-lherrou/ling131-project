again they get [noise] and uh you know before we went to take a break we were talking about your transition to working with the guy who created the Gloria Mr ... has got to go and it's considered the godfather of the boutique\nWorld absolutely is now what\nWould you say is with the greatest things you learn from Ernesto about the cigar industry [noise]\nYou don't let the cigar be what it needs to be you can't force you to be something that you want it to be\nWow so that's a phrase unlike comment but you know it's actually something we've never actually heard on the show yeah but that's I mean that's really wow I'd keep continue okay so\nYou know you've looked him speech like this All right I'm now I've got a everybody that was the last I don't\nI don't even know where to go from that but that was great but yes please feel but it's a philosophy of life like you know there's certain things that you can push and things are going to happen the way they're going to happen outside of your control right so tobacco has a way of when you're working with it um to be what it wants to be one that wants to be that you know and so really quick story about blending\nLaurie would work on blessed with the guys in the factories and you know you think you have the greatest went on a planet you know like guys great job ... your high five and then I'd go I'd come back to the states and\nAnd I'd have some with me and then they have the rest of the scar show up a week later and smoke and I'm like not to put our so I'd be on the phone I'm like whoa you sent me the wrong blanche like read the coke yup that's to Koch now it's not the same sky notice it you know something changed [noise] two weeks later\nHe either was getting better or just getting worse same conversation or did you guys do to change it what I learned was ...\nWell not what I learned was tobacco is is ... ... again I'm going to put to put us in cooking terms when my mom would make gravy to for you it ties up there and they saw subscribing to split skip that color [laughter] but you know you make sauce went a gravy one day right and it's really good they started getting a\nReally good man and the third day is fun fantastic and so\nStuff has to marry stuff has to work together and I learned about forty five days is like the number when tobacco is going to be what is going to be good or bad so think about your play up the numbers right\nYou're working on a blend forty five times forty five times forty five at forty five and forty five forty five year at like six months before I got mine it and see if it's right\nAnd so tobacco needs to be what it needs to be when it wants to be that and I learned that from Ernesto I learned that you know not everybody has a great power um because he jak me one day he came back from the factory and I'm sitting in my office and he threw three cigars on my desk 'cause I've got three blanche where\nIn a damn I talked to about go so far scar smoked ... okay second one third one was great ticket so five o'clock ... how did you think of the first one was okay second was cussing cigar [laughter]\nReally [laughter] okay if you missed a you know he was like listen you know I'm not trying to mess with you I'm just telling you that different parts of the day you're palate\nChanges actually I was ... when most objective things in the years very much so I mean honestly my psychology days and and I like to talk about this one I'm doing events are talking to people\nAs a chef there's six things now you can taste right and it's just proven\nSweet so we're sour so bitter mommy which is meat flavors through like Miami I've ever heard of that money so we use for a uh I Do I usually do yeah she stumped today yeah mommy's getting new mommy mommy was to fit flavor that people can\nYou can get all mommy to like mushrooms anchovies sauce you get to me that figure it'd be salty\nBut you has that that you know savory flavor is almost like me and then the genius decidedly said meat\nSo six flavor now and they're still researching it so\nYou can go on to your time you can measure and you can see if you're a super taster or not you can taste so here's where it gets really wild I think I have a really great power because there's a lot of things I can taste right so highs and lows I Can't taste\nEyes hurt me meaning that if really really spicy food hurts me I cannot I could don't enjoy and and if there's no flavors that hurts me as well because I Can't tastes anything\nTo think about this is a blender and as a chef you have to agree to a place where you can taste everything now a\nJew or may not be able to taste all six thanks so if I make a blender has a little bit ... since ... said call you up to the spice or the right which I'm more accustomed to her ... so so then you're like you know ... when my when I was like the cigar because genetically you are not built to fix things\nSo it was a letter you got to try to put all six different points of your mouth because you're tasting on a plate dresser and all that brings the smoker palate exactly for them to develop the flavor every day for flavor that they're going to be a court they\nActually interesting wherever artificial if you are not able to discern any this flavors and it may not be something that you enjoy and you're not right or wrong and AJC dot right or wrong and what's funny about that issue jak each other you know about you\nThat's the fun part about this but it's kind of freaky thing so I always tell folks listen I'll look at the way you eat that try to pick a cigar to kind of measures really well if you have like a great show the most important thing if you're like a ... year we'll have you with\nHere we don't yet do you actually have the old soundbites somewhere she and she knew somebody knew when she was like three or four years I really [noise] yeah I don't know the cargo fighting for them to the show but it was the cigar princess sound bite is actually pretty hot well I'd love to hear that she's been coming to the radio show fool I don't know four or five\nIn the main thing I can point to me the gun ...\n[laughter] a a a\nFear that you believe you weren't able to hear your voice over there [noise]\nLet's get back to our guests here are Michael Jeannie I'm into cigars so I just point now you what the godfather cigar in Miami and this guy's basically really a legend started out of nothing a little teeny teeny weeny factory in the valley here\nBuilt a nationally and internationally known brand you work with them and along come the general cigar so\nJust back up we'll just back up something no no no no you're absolutely right so let me make that connection so I I'm ... I'm going to go work\nI work in a national want to move on to other things many cooks me up with right now so I meet with ... early part of two thousand nine\nWe have conversations and then everything goes talk for a while so trade shows in um Vegas so it wasn't like a foot you know it will open a well here's one I'll tell you why would I learned so\nHey we're going to talk to July PCP our trade show we miss each other I'm selling he signed he launches Siri art that at that trade show was which is a sphere put maps with just blew everything up absolutely blow it up and so you know we come out at a trade show and I'm like are nice do you know what's going on I mean this was like the longest to you know\nInterview process and the ... been going back and forth and probably now six months so that's a long time right so right now you're looking to move on and your land yeah\nRight now I'm In I'm limited by love to move to the east coast of Florida you know getting closer to Miami Miami Vice roots right [laughter] and when I learned really quickly is one Saturday I understand it or not so says his company to this company called Swedish Match and I'm like I\nNo idea who these people are just before the transition right God it was a little off right so so Swedish Match I purchased a the entire mass market division from general cigar Isaac earlier that year right\nAnd so now they buy their first premium ... and ... come on it so I gave her an extra ... like well you know it was nice talking to you I Wish you the greatest like is not on on a\nStew interested we're still working through some things running with ... mile papal so finally I called him up I'm like hey what are we doing when he goes what are you doing September twenty third and now you tell me we fly to Richmond, Virginia I meet with the vice president a president I sit with Ernesto next day I had the job\nI Am now the national sales manager for ... so so he was selling cars out due to the middle of the good guys and that's what I realized I was required to do was to go she's going on and obviously you don't want\nTo disclose on it and I don't I just go as far as you said if you are to what's going on ... exactly what are you concerned at the time that now you're taking a job with a guy who was literally a boutique manufacture builds his\nBase from nothing and now we're going to be part of one of the biggest for guard conglomerates in the world were you was that a\nA concerted time or did you think that's even better\n[noise] I thought you know a I had no idea I just thought that you know a guy with who has a passion and hunger um and and the passion is\nYou know okay let me just talk about passion really quick I hear that word thrown around do all the time and I hear ya I'll catch talking about that you know you don't have passion is you wake up in the morning and you're thinking about what you want to do and what isn't your soul\nAnd for made cigars and creating things\nAnd every moment of the day like this beautiful woman ... you're in love with your thinking about her all day long and that's your craft and you go to bed and you can stop thinking about that\nSo if you don't have that in your life and you're not thinking about what you love all day long it's not a passion I just wanted to clear that a great analogy that self food so\nI so now I joined us on my thing was I always wanted a great branded I could hope move to a different place and Ernesto and I would have perfect partner is when we started working together because\nHe was unarmed polished Jen that needed some help and structure to do some things and he became one of my great mentors initial burn history because we to this day or great friends um and he taught me a lot and I was helped me in ... I was help to be able to move to brand a different place so what happened was out\nI fully ... in in in line in in January of two thousand two thousand and I never forget in the Miami coyote she'll office effects comes through January six and says\nA Swedish Match purchases six sixty four percent of general cigar\nAnd like who are these people they don't make matches a mass market they bought Ernesto\nAnd now they owned sixty four percentage I don't see that are like ... who are these people like Swedish Fish Swedish right I mean who are you guys so it was like oh that's interesting\nUm [noise] we were independent we grew to business and we got to a point where we needed to get really serious about you know moving moving the organization does so I had a lot of brokers Ernesto actually kept the brokers any work with because he says he's a loyal guy\nAnd I was a broker so I understood it broke ground world is so we had dimension but we need to be able if you really going to run an organization you need to have your own folks and so I needed to move towards sales force are wanted by own independent guys on what happened basically was as well\nGeneral cigar or a ... we have a sales force we can ship we'll marketing you know one we trade you guys to general cigar and they can accomplish all that and that's how we ended up at channels for\nOne and we'll go to our shoulder I Want to get to where you're at risk being supple of itself it's only to\nYour show us to do your work on the glory it gets hurt role and eventually you branch off and start your own division they're called boundaries sir where I guess you know creative juices are glowing gas cars up she'll things all based on how long were you doing the foundry flip through my\nProgression journal Scott I came in as I went from his national shows matter to a marketing guy because I have a ton of ideas so that was my first ... became a director of marketing and then I just started working wrestle left in two thousand nine to start his own business I took over ... and I put a team around me or you know\nOf guys and so we started to innovate and so I ended up by generals who are becoming the head of innovations decorative director\nI was just spiritual leader of a law Gloria and then I created founder which is my alter ego of creativity okay and so I had a lot of hats that I wore um had an absolute last I Love working with the people in general cigar [noise] so what was interesting is okay and so what May of twenty six gene\nAre wonderful federal drug administrator and Rob four hundred and Ninety nine pages or what ever\nThat was ... foot not five hundred four hundred and so is the guy that created stuff I'm like you know my time here is um you know\nWaiting very quickly and I knew that and that was fine with\nThat because that's where it's going to stifle any credit is processes industry\nAnd that's what I Love to do so you know I basically retired for a year and um you know\nI moved to California will know so what are ... so\nI I'm three things I did my mom's eighty five she's absolutely my hero my niece and nephew are based out of Philly so I was living in Richmond, Virginia when you spend time with them which I didn't get a chance to do I worked at like a ... because I Want it I'm going to live so if anybody wants to know a hundred and three years old plus two days\nSo I'm On this path is I don't want to miss anything so I really got very super healthy and I traveled\nThe ...

so we've slow smoked are pork butts for three to four hours there now about one fifty to one sixty degrees Fahrenheit and it's time for phase two of this cook\nAnd phase one we got as much smoke as we could under the bus and now the only job left is to power them through those stalls and cook the butts up to two hundred and three degrees Fahrenheit so to do that\nWe have a few options to get their first\nWe can rebuild another fire and spend the next eight to Fifteen hours outside smoking ad on you're a smoker and fiddling with the fire it's not going to get any more smoke in it so maybe we wrapped the butts in tinfoil\nWell wrapping 'em in tinfoil does reduce the evaporative cooling and it speeds up the cooking process but why waste a bunch of charcoal or propane to do this outside it's not necessary and more importantly there's nothing to gain from it\nAny cooking equipment will do because we're done smoking them and we only need to cook them up to two hundred and three so you can boil it and throw it in your indoor oven an electric roasting oven an electric smoker or a slow cooker\nBut you should also know that wrapping it into an foil also softens the meats exterior bark and it might even make it mushy so what's the solution I don't wrap mine in soil and I put it in a twenty two court electric roasting of and\nI say it is I mean them and I elevated up off the bottom of that twenty two court roasting electric often if you have a huge slow cooker that will hold to four pounds of pork but you can use that to\nJust keep them off the bottom of the cooker and allow lots of air flow all around them once again you can see photos of this on me masters radio dot com at the brisket smoked Chuck pork butts link on our recipes page\nIt was like to follow much get catch fire [noise] of course you don't know what does that never happens [noise] sorry Tennessee dumb question skipped\nBefore you place the but in the oven or the slow cooker there's a couple of things to do if you're using your indoor um and you want to put a drip pan underneath them if you're using a slow cooker roasting oven cover the bottom with tinfoil or as slow cooker liner then pour a small amount of liquid\nAnd it's not a lot just a small bit use your own homemade beef stock from the freezer or some store bought stock\nAt some watery veggies like carrots celery yellow summer squash mushrooms and onions whatever you want then place your elevation device and set the butts in place put the cover on and stuff to cook her out of high or two Seventy five for an hour to get it going again\nThen dial it back after an hour to low or two twenty five and let it go in fact you can go take a nap or watch a movie if you want to or a hockey game because this will take\nAt least a few more hours\nNow every hour or so take your meet up with an instant read digital thermometer just like you were out on the smoker\nAs far as the evaporative cooling and the stalls go they're still going to happen and the slow cooker but when they do just turn the heat up for half an hour and chug right on through them this is exactly why I like electric cookers for this phase of this type of a cook you have total\nAn instant control now remember what I said about evaporative cooling the heat is pushing its way in and the water held in the media as being forced out at various camps this exchange strikes a neutral temperature balance causing\nThe meat to stop cooking for periods of time when you increase the heat you disrupt that neutral balance the additional heat over powers the cooling and started cooking I got\nSo you're imposing you're cooking will to continue the cooking process after half an hour or so when the temperatures moving again dial the feedback to low flip the pork butts in the cook her about every half an hour or so and you'd want to get even cooking that way and flipping them will help that\nYou're discussing tactics you realize what this really comes down to millions and millions of lives hanging on what I saw that snatched\nWhen the butts reached two hundred two hundred and three degrees turn liquor attempt to warm and let it sit for at least an hour or so\nHolding your big meets holding your big me too is what we're going to be doing is it's important to do because it tender arises the meat with this method you can do it right in the slow cooker covered another reason I liked the slow cooker as the equipment to use for these projects\nDuring this hour while your meat is holding you can prep\nSome homemade sauce or sandwiches if you're going to make sandwiches with it in a small pan if you like barbecue sauce in your pulled pork sauce just added to taste as the stock heats up I don't add anything to mine I like a naturally meat only flavored sauce nothing sweet\nI lose a major after your pork\nBut have held for an hour or so removed them to a bowl uncovered them with foil while you get the other stuff ready\nDrain the Jews in the bottom of the slow cooker through a colander lined with cheese quad do this as many times as you want as it will clarify your meat broth further each time that you do it\nOr when you're finished training it adds some tears sauce on the stove top and store the rest when everything is ready\nPoll the pork butts with forks do this after they've called for a bit not right away remember they cooked up the entire hunk of meat to two hundred and three degrees there hot\nAnd you need to use utensils to do this do not use your hands\nDestroy the pulled pork in the fridge combine it with some sauce to keep them meet moist under refrigeration our final word on the evaporative cooling stalls these happening all big meets between a hundred and fifty and two hundred degrees that just the physics of cooking meat up to high internal temps\nI'm not a scientist but it doesn't take one to understand this as the meats interior heats in contracts colder water is displaced and forced out to the surface where it evaporates\nAs it travels outward it cools the meat offsets the heat energy coming in until the exchange strikes a neutral balance or a stall you fix that by camping the slow cooker heat up for a short period of time to get it moving against pretty simple and it's exactly why I prefer finishing meet\nIn a slow cooker you have total an instant control well that's it for the third degree park but accusation show hopefully\nNo one has tried to destroy your life by wrongfully accused you of lousy pulled pork and this helps you avoid being called a giant BP had\nHad\nNo idea how to do a pork but easily that would ruin your reputation that really would a peeping hit pork but that's what we should have called the show the people had pork but [noise] so my final tip when you read the meat\nJust add a small amount of your favorite sauce and some of the juice that you took off the bottom of either the smoker or the slow cooker and that'll re moisturizer the meet an ad labor anything else does\nA than any final comments since you always seemed to have one on the justice having a\nI'm Sorry man I'm I'm ... from the last couple of weeks\nWell you have just set foot on ...\nWhere we
