class\nAnd the more extreme it you know what when Maxine Waters who's been a back then sure entire life is kind of a mainstream Democrat you know they got serious problems and the irony is that with all of a sexual misconduct cases most of them are Democrats you got Keith Ellison who still running for attorney general is mental charitable Democrat\nThis is why you do when I have some conservative talk about the ... it's all a conspiracy and so I I\nAm against or conservative and they cited a few victims there but when you look because the Democrats are largely in power with\nA public

stand Al Franken the personally at us and its politics there he probably shouldn't have left the Senate because he was groping some woman by now I'm not saying what he did was right or whatever but but if they want to have that standard fine because let's decapitated a whole bunch of Democrats there at that threshold there so\nThat gets to my point and everybody's part what happens to the presumption of innocence will this road they've gone down well not\nJust this whole process you if you had true traditional liberals and civil libertarians over the years including Democrats were to come forward said you know there's a reason why we have to actually limitation this evening is even prosecutorial now in in Maryland there and it's from the high school and I was at a in a Senator Feinstein it was it was a person of of of principle\nShe would have dismissed us things that I Can't do you think something happened in high school\nAnd and you know what what we have nowadays is\nEverything is considered the same level as rape or a you know and and but\nIt's you know you you have a a a workplace where somebody calls but somebody in her hair or whatever and this makes it an unwelcome workplace so we in effect had the effect of ... the real serious stuff of rape and all these are putting everything on the same class\nWhat about Senator Feinstein that this is the way she wants to go out and the end of her career and and all her ... she\nGot in in Nineteen Ninety two she was elected alone with Barbara Boxer and so called dear you're the one woman there were boxer defeated research just enraged Bruce surgeons in her dear old friend of mine there\nAnd Sean mentioned Feinstein was seen as water only by comparison your colleague Barbara Boxer all your national

Ninety eight percent sure\nUh and and that's been largely depending what quote the FBI find look there's another finding too I welcome the FBI or a asking people questions on their own one big reason most people that are going to be asking are accusers\nAnd if the accusers light to the FBI center Grassley and Lindsey Graham of both said they need to be prosecuted and I think I think for herself

Anthony Kennedy vacancy it was a kind of a fifty fifty justice gather a lot of rulings are\nCame down on one side of the bed he woke up on and and he's been replaced by a solid constitutional is which is a a a wonderful thing\nAnd and now we have a situation in which ah\nWith with with Kavanaugh here comes another constitution list\nAnd there is no way in the world there there is no way that the today's left is going to allow\nA dozen other constitutional list I'm On the court for the people said well they didn't get this bad for Gorsuch Gorsuch somehow made it in what seems like a walk on the beach now compared to today's standards and and that's because they'll give you one\nYou know there is that old precepts that when you win the election you've you've heard this a million times elections have consequences right and they do that's white bronco blurred knows Morocco Obama's election I'd consequences\nAnd one of those consequences or Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan on on the Supreme Court two constitutions shaping judicial tyrants because that's what you're going to get when Democrats main people at the Supreme Court but but it was Lindsey Graham said in that magnificent Thursday or\nA moment of his it said that as as as he said as the Democrats said as as as he said to uh\nTo judge Kavanaugh when you get on the court when you see Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan you tell them Lindsay said hello because I voted for them and I would never do that what these people are trying to do for you I still what are we um to four days later after that Lindsey Graham moments\nI I've I rarely them as a\nI mean I I I may have leapt to my feet cheering I'm Glad I wasn't driving cars I it was it was so magnificent it brought such moral clarity\nAnd moral clarity is what we need moving forward in this crazy week this crazy week a week made necessary by Jeff Flake and we're going to talk about him and I met him in fact we're going to hear from him in a minute because he is at some\nEvent in Boston some radio station is doing something and he was just a it in one and they have a an interviewer was asking him a bunch of things and since you know Jeff Flake runs the world now I guess we'd better probably\nYou know figure out what to\nWhat the oracle says and believes these days but the moral necessity of this is something that I Am addressing in a town hall dot com column that ah the rub tomorrow and that is that this is not just a a Supreme Court\nBattle anymore ... this is not just a victory that we should seek a because we wanted constitutional list on the Supreme Court this is\nA moral sesame because it's not just about him reaching the court anymore these kinds of tactics these kinds of things that you've seen these these despicable bottom feeding tactics by today's\nLeft from actual senators to cartoonists to column writers to two pundits to people all walks of left his life\nThey can't they simply cannot win they simply can not when they have dashed against the rocks the basic precepts of jurisprudence\nAnd not even jurisprudence think about a couple of concepts innocent until proven guilty not just on a federal law school precepts that's not something that is just a courtroom ideal innocent until proven guilty\nIs a basic of human decency it's what you will for anybody who's accused of anything same thing with requiring evidence an allegation is made\nWell what's the evidence that's the first question you don't accept an allegation on face value this believe women saying it is a scam it in his political bullying\nJeff Flake was bullied him at elevator and and and folded like a skinny seventh grader on the playground\nAnd and we're now in this needless weaker FBI probe what's\nThe latest hang on the White House has authorized the FBI to expand its investigation interviewing anybody it seems to edit it deems necessary\nAs long as the review is finished by the end of the way oh did you hear any bugs today that the FBI I don't know what kind of leakage is going on there imagined that an FBI leak but there was buzz earlier today that the FBI might be ready to wrap this up like tomorrow [noise] okay whenever you got till friday you got till friday that\nIs what ... told us a last friday is you know how old are you can have my vote you'll have it on the committee but you can only have it in the full Senate ah\nAfter a week of a further probes\nAnd and look the best case scenario the best case scenario is that this week\nGives a frozen Boehner to the Democrats who have demanded it\nCreates a comfort zone to ideologically vague people like Jeff Flake provides a ... I Would say cover ... provide comfort of for the Republican votes of Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and maybe here's where\nCover comes in and maybe provide cover for some Democrats who I think we want to vote for Kavanaugh I think they want to not because they like him anymore than Cory Booker does but because they really need to wind up\nAs you know there are dead you know Democrats famously running in states that Trump won and won big Joe mansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota\nAnd these are people they don't just want to vote for judge get they probably don't want to vote for judge Kavanaugh but they need to vote for judge Kavanaugh because I'll say right now\nIf Joe Manchin votes for judge Kavanaugh he takes a big bite out of Patrick Morrisey attack on him Patrick Morsi is the west Virginia attorney general he's a magnificent man I think he's gonna win and that and that that would be fantastic that would just be a wonderful thing to Patrick Morrisey be the senator from West Virginia instead of Joe Manchin and I like Joe ...\nJoe mentions one of those Democrats who does not make your teeth sketch\nHe's a left of center you know big labor but you're socially conservative sort of kind of sometimes West Virginia guy and I know that territory very well as the first place I ever worked in radio back forty some years ago\nAnd and loved it then love it now um love it so much that I Want them to have a conservative centered [laughter] so let's so let's go Patrick Morrisey and\nPatrick Morrisey as blood joining Joe manager right now I like ... am to vote for a for Kavanaugh\nWhich mansion may do and this week of FBI foolishness may may give them cover and so if we get to the end of this week and the deck is cleared\nAnd the nonsense says that is as old as all played out and we have a successful full Senate vote on Kavanaugh is confirmed it will have all been worth it right it will have all been worth it\nBut first we got to get there first of all that but I just that has to actually happened and it may not be it really may not have you met today's left have you seen these people have you seen what they do have you heard what they do\nThey will move heaven and earth to prevent this not not just this nomination their goal is to stretch this to the election win back the house or they can impeach Trump and when the Senate\nSo that even if he they they don't impeach him which they won't uh he'll never get another nominee on the court [noise]\n'cause when you boil it all down is all about making sure that they're sacrament of abortion is untouched that's what this whole thing has always been about you know that right if not I'll help you out with that\nSo um some of the lowest things have happened over the last few days I'm gonna share them with you because my my thought is some folks overplay their hand smart Davison for Michael Mann that happy Monday\nIs Jeff Flake job and I and and by the way I'm trying to turn them in the Ted Cruz or tournament to me this is what a responsible\nJeff Flake onto done at that occasion\nMa'am I I Am so sorry for anything that happened to you and I honor your experience and I'm open to your experience and you have every prayer and every good wish for healing and ... that's all I have to say about your experience or a victimization I have exactly the the proper deference that anybody should have for that\nHowever you identify judge Kavanaugh as someone who sexually assaulted someone that is simply not been born out in the fact it may in some investigation may play up next week but it hasn't been yet my decision my vote needs to be based on what the evidence shows\nAnd what testimony reveals and not based on anything anybody tells me no matter how passionate they may be about something that might have happened unrelated in their lives\nNow please get out of the elevator I gotta go that's how it goes on but it didn't sense now we have this week of hell but wait a minute on that wait a minute on that\nWhat is this week going to do when you're together today and tomorrow I'm enormously grateful to once again the talk show God's you're smiling a Michael's back Wednesday Thursday Friday and coursing and moving on a ... from it [noise]\nBy the time we get Wednesday Thursday Friday of it was friday being just supposed a deadline for this entire FBI dog and pony show\nI I think there's a possibility here because as bleak as it may look and as a twist it off as I Am about to having to endure this week you realize we are talking about today's left right we are talking about today's Democratic Party right\nI I think the air hangs thick with possibilities that they make overplay their hand so profoundly that they may\nReveal such a deep ... guide hatred and the things they say and I do and I'm not I'm Talking about cartoonist columnist and United States senators and everybody in between\nThat the pendulum of empathy may swing toward judge Kavanaugh as millions of Americans just a good grief enough enough this man has suffered enough and there is still no evidence of the type of wrongdoing that originally created this problem for him\nI think by friday that may be the landscape I pray that it is okay nothing a year marrying let's uh let's have you on TALK back to one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy

made me a day that's not but President Trump had a big news conference a that was mostly about trade issues and this is funny ... baby we can wage this in today maybe tomorrow a\nBecause as a conservative I'm sketchy on tariffs\nAnd they're not my favorite thing but I get you there's no arguing with the results sometime is that\nThese countries are falling into line as as as President Trump tosses out all these sharp elbow tariffs next thing you know here we are signing a big old deal with Canada and Mexico as the rest of the trillions of dollars it it it seems tremendous so there there was a lot of of trust\nAudio this morning there was one of my favorite parts and it was talking about Kavanaugh and talking about past alcohol use something he knows by his own admission nothing about so play this and then I have a question afterward go\nAnd if he didn't live out his drinking does that mean you'll pull his I don't think he did\nHere's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right so one of my totally good traits I don't [noise]\nLooking for something that as I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I'd be I'd be the world's worst but\nI never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing and I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man who is drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him\nI I pray not I certainly hope with every for bone in my body that I Hope that's not the\nCase and um and maybe this is cause for some optimism because and and it sounds it sounds\nMaybe a little ... and I don't mean it too because I think they are recent events that the kind of backup what I'm about to say\nAnd that is that today's left today's Democratic Party may overplay its hand so ... ... by the time we get to friday a whole lot of Americans and maybe more than a few senators are just going to be saying enough\nIs enough there's nothing new here\nWe've had the entire week the FBI probe that everybody was raining us to do okay we did it are you happy\nNow the answer of course for many will be no of course they're not going to be happy now some people will never be happy because you know exactly what the gain is they'll lay delay delay attack attack\nAttack a lot of people who said we just want a week just take it to friday or next week are going to be the exact same people\nWho are then going to say watch not enough it it's an artificial deadline I mean why in the world where we are just trying to get to the bottom of the fire people afraid of the truth oh my gosh you will hear all of that garbage you hear all of that nonsense and so just hopefully and Lindsey Graham and the court I played last hour\nOr said look at it I think he might have heard some of what I heard a little bit of bugs it's not that the FBI might be about rapidly so they had a nice full weekend how long does it take to talk to five or six people\nHow long does it take you know I mean how many questions to ask\nSo that I don't know when the FBI is going to a set to make its findings known I I Will tell you I Am comfortable asserting that I have no expectation of additional damaging information\nVis very FBI has looked into a judge Kavanaugh six times this is time number seven\nAnd so what's the likelihood that oh my gosh is a gang rape is ... how did we miss\nThat I don't think that's going to happen [noise] real quick [noise]\nYou you host a talk show you take calls\nAnd then there's a little tape loop in your head that sometimes rolls of a previous call I Want to go back to a gentleman uh it was very uh it was it was an invigorating phone call gentleman from Columbus and that's I think for his call his main points were Republicans don't want the truth Kavanaugh's a liar a\nIt's all terrible and you know it did where we're just trying to get the bottom of this and it's a destruction game going on and or or a cover up going on blah blah blah so I asked him several times what is the evidence what is the evidence that\nDr Ford is telling the truth what is the ... and saw that pesky evidence that\nThe doctor for this properly identified judge Kavanaugh as a pet is her attacker\nGentleman replied with a sentence that began will judge Kavanaugh is lying dot dot dot I said well we'll know so that that's real estate in your premise you're not telling me the evidence that he's lying you're telling me that you think he is life I Would get gentleman over the benefit of the doubt I think the idea of where he might have been going\nAnd this is a concept that I I think it's going to be heavily played this uh this week\nI think the gentleman's the end of his sentence would have been\nThat he's lying about some things so maybe he's lying about others okay ah concept in law the juries are free if you find that ended a witness if you find that a witness has indeed factually lied about one thing you may then cast whatever amount of that you are on everything else that witnesses said oh that could be interesting huh\nSo perhaps the gentleman's point I Want to get I Want to give him full shrift ah is is that he found judge Kavanaugh not believable on some other things and that struck him as evidence that he's lying about everything\nThat that's far from a from a gracious interpretation but it if if it ... but it's something that the gentleman is is entitled to however here's the thing he has not caught judge capital in a lie about\nAnything and nobody will no one will that precept only applies if you find someone to absolutely prove ugly has lied about something that we have now is judge Kavanaugh\nTalking about some drinking episodes and there's some people from his pass to go ... you might be underplayed and the drinking episodes usually get a little harder than he let on\nAnd then there's all this year book code language of you know the ... or a love me us as they said and there's also learned your book uh\nDidn't settles triangle and booze and this and that is so stupid\nBut here's the thing are in their ... and everybody started Googling stuff is rule I don't think you do lose the truth about that rule I think you might be soft peddling that we're never going to know okay we will never not this week\nOr any week ... ever learn the judge Kavanaugh was factually misrepresenting anything about his way word moments at Georgetown Prep\nAs such there will not arise any basis for that legal precept of if we caught your eye on them out a and B you might have been lying about the Indy\nSo with that are in a moment a boy the the United States to be in the Senate gallery today because there's red hot Senate action actually there's not really actually there's red hot Senate talking [laughter]\nThere's no real action we're waiting for action we're trying to take action we thought we were going to take action but Jeff Flake sort of that he took action ... got a closet and\nAnd took action to bring the whole thing to a grinding halt thanks guys [noise] um but but Chuck Schumer refers to some of exactly what I'm Talking about there\nThat now they're moving the goalposts and it is not that there's any evidence that judge Kavanaugh\nIs is a horrible cereal sex criminal but rather they're going after going after his credibility on other stuff and you'll hear a Senator Schumer attempt that in a moment the one thing I said I wanted to share as the last hour of the evaporated\nWas this amazing quote\nFrom a woman named Elizabeth last us I think we have rich Lowry to thank over National Review it is an excerpt from a book that she wrote called witness for the defense\nOr she is an expert in psychology law human memory eyewitness testimony I saw another article tweeted somebody in the New York times and like the year two thousand or I'll find it if if I Need to ah ... it was just a very compelling a essay written by a woman\nWho was raped I guess some time prior to two thousand 'cause she wrote it in two thousand\nAnd she said I I but there was a lineup identified my attacker I was one hundred percent certain that that was my attacker\nAnd I was mistaken and her courage you're talking about courage that takes courage to admit having blown call\nBut as morally necessary to shore and uh and and you know what else is morally and intellectually necessary for us to recognize that this can happen to anybody to anybody even\nDr Ford so here is the excerpt from Elizabeth Loftis in her book witness for the defense\nFor how can we disbelieve the sworn testimony of eyewitnesses to a crime when the witnesses are absolutely convinced that they are telling the truth why after all ... they lie\nBut there's the word why that's the word that gets us off the track you see I witnesses point a finger at innocent defendants are not liars\nToday genuinely believe and the truth of their testimony faced they see before them is the face of the attacker the face of innocence has become the face of guilt that's the frightening part so truly horrifying idea that our memories can be changed\nInextricably altered and what we think we know what we believe with all our hearts is not necessarily the truth\nMan that's a paragraph that is a paragraph from Elizabeth last us in her book witness for that is that\nA woman with ... and psychology law eyewitness testimony human memory things like that I never ever ever actively believed that this entire thing was a trick so dirty that they find a woman who would under oath make up stuff and intent of why I never believed that\nAnd as I watched a doctor forge testimony on Thursday morning she you know let's let's go let's go\nTo the dictionary on another word she seemed to what's the word everybody uses\nBut what is credible mean to me it it was it made it means somebody who was beaten believable seems believable and but it means more than that and we'll examine it takes more your calls and looks more audio of this busy busy day Mark Dayton from Michael ... stick around\nOne eight hundred nine and five seven genes Seventy six though Michael mid vigil [noise]\nSilly me I I guess I mean\nI I mean this is Saturday Saturdays this week ... I'll be friday is this week this work week\nYou know [laughter] so do do do tease me Mitch don't tease me so uh it's it's when will this FBI thing ramp up I don't know so let's let's continue to take a look at your thoughts as we had to Los Angeles Robert Mark Davis in Michael how are you sir\nYourself Hi great\nYou stay room just now that there's no evidence that just kind of an ally Iraq several ... in in in that area it kept fading about one or the witnesses said it didn't happen that's not what they said they said that they will remember\nOn ... took a doctor for the allegations quote from judge Kavanaugh are not merely uncorroborated their refuted by the very people she says we're there you would have I guess what someone someone that's going to know what I understand I\nI and I understand completely and judge Kavanaugh pointed out the various people who have no memory of having been there\nAnd he suggests that the reputation on the Ames\nIll that's not what he said he said all the way the stated it they have to go back and look at it that\nSays that that I'm ... I'm looking at the quote right now and to quote from Dr from judge Kavanaugh Dr forwards allegations are not merely uncorroborated it's refuted by the very people she says we're there and we can estimate antics game all day and semantics is important it's the meaning of words are people\nI I ... I hear I had to\nHide it too so so I tell you well let's do let let's go beyond the refutation or the no memory et cetera is this a true statement not one person backs her story not one person agrees with her story OK\nCorrect It's not that they ... they don't agree\nIs not not one person not one person who supports are certainly not one person agrees with her story or corroborate her story is that correct\nNow I wouldn't I wouldn't have to start\nI'm Sorry who did I must have been something who ... who did corroborate her story again I'm Sorry I mean\nNo one confirmed or keep that but if I Want I don't I'm not real because I don't remember\nWhere you are actually disagree then you're you're you're you're you're saying that I can prove what we say I was never there are all in all any witness can really do is they I have no memory of that because I tell you what generally speaking a witness on the on the on the chair says listen I was not there than somebody some stupid Polaroid picture you'll be in trouble for the rest of your life\nThere is no cooperation that's what's important there is no cooperation let's get nesting wrapped up and vote on this man and do so soon Mark Davis in Michael Moore I packed\nMy pillows now offering a special deals buy one get one free go to my pillow dogs um\nUse the promo code ...\n... am nine twenty two yet [noise] [noise] with that\nSort of a news signed by new in Washington\nThe FBI has not yet contacted the California prosecutor who says it's very important but he Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her thirty six years ago when they were in high school the person close to Christine Blasey Ford says if the FBI as earlier today has not been in touch with their lawyers to schedule\nAnd interview President Trump told reporters today the White House he doesn't know what the FBI investigation\nMay find Republican Senator Jeff flake is stoking new speculation about a possible presidential run as she emerges as a central figure in the explosive debate over President Trump's Supreme Court selection\nThree days ago flake singlehandedly delayed Kavanaugh's confirmation proceedings by insisting on an FBI investigation breaking ranks as he did with other Republican members of the Senate Judiciary panel mixed bag on Wall street\nThe Dow was up one hundred and Ninety two points the NASDAQ down by nine more details it as sort of news dot com\nI twenty the answer I think\nThere is a rafting in traffic ...

Bush on weapons of mass destruction was all why everybody thought that that Saddam had WMDs\nA sort of in in somebody's yet that's the person who writes the that's the person who bugged me I Know what I Want to know what you just mistaken but you totally believing in your heart and in your mind you're not lying you're just mistaken now the intent to deceive why is that important\nSomething you said it's a bit you know is true and you say it with the intent to deceive okay there I don't give you to give you two two sentences that will show you exactly what I mean when you may say something that you know it was on the show but it's not what the intent to deceive you're ready [noise]\nDaddy I drew a picture of you doesn't it look exactly like you [laughter]\nAnd get it okay let me bring you a little closer to home\nHoney [laughter] does this dress make my bud look big see I see you understand me completely now you understand me completely to ally is something you said that you know is untrue with the intent to deceive\nPaso credibility what his credibility credibility means more than just presenting well\nCredit judge Kavanaugh is credible because he brought passion to his testimony he's not credible because he spoke of clarity and conviction\nOf Dr Ford is not credible because she spoke with with with conviction and she spoke with passion and she spoke with where our own identified certainty performance does not make someone credible\nYou remain or understand if that's a that's a thoroughly fair question\nI Would indeed and if you're asking me the day after or the month after I absolutely would if I sit on it for thirty some years is there a possibility that I remember the wrong person yes there is\nOkay if their parking within your family your wife made act like about a man that is something short years ago would you believe why would you act like he was some kind of political a job or something\nGotcha gotcha another another very another very fair question another very fair question the first thing I don't want to do is put them down and kill him so for being honest with each other that's so but but to your to your actual question would I Believe her I Would listen to her love her care for her but here's the thing\nIt would be my job as just as a rational human being if she says something and let's say she is saying it about a public figure and nobody else can corroborated in any way shape or form I mean I might very well just defer to her because I Love her and it's my job to support her an honor her\nBut I could not blame the world if the world remain skeptical because the world must require evidence\nThis is not about religion is not about whether Russell Ford believes Dr Ford is about whether we all can and without evidence we can not\n... that you're an avid\nThat's ... that's ... that's going to ... that's called the way life has to me that's the way life has to be we cannot believe people we cannot invest in people's stories with no evidence\nWe can't you know that right we can't that's a crazy world\nWell you have you gone by the world because you're in\nA very [laughter] that's a crazy crazy country

my point and you just made my point it would be unfair to believe something about you without evidence unfair\nI'll bet another told you might make diminish or anybody else's on some other issue might be about the unfairness of things that happen without evidence so let's all live in the best world we can where we act on facts and evidence I think that's just a just a a good idea ... thank you best

senators on top of senators ready I got John Cornyn some audio here and then\nA Bill Cassidy Republican Louisiana's got to join us live right out of the box in the next hour or so sit tight for that but meanwhile Senator Cornyn was talking about viewing all of all of this testimony through a very personal Lynn's\nWill Lisa Murkowski do what will Susan Collins do us one of the world will Jeff Flake do moment by moment and this week contains\nQuestions about how long the FBI probes going to take her there was bus I mentioned earlier they can rent this thing up tomorrow\nThat seems quake or the development for the White House today was they've essentially said look\nWe're not limiting the scope of this in any way examine what ever it is you want to examine just so long as you're done by friday and so there is any color which are reliably from the Democrats' side saying wait a minute why does this artificial uh\nA limitation on the scope and timing of the investigation ... woman into your buddy Jeff Flake who who established is\nNo longer than a week and and no further than the scope of what we've been testifying about so far but in a in an environment where the goal posts are always moving and the terms are always changing lettuce heading into\nThe United States Senate the state of Louisiana has been very very well represented of late a junior Senator John Kennedy is on the Judiciary Committee\nYou've seen a lot of him senior senator is Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana who joined us right now what a pleasure to have you sir welcome to the Michael ... that show\nThat mark thank you for having me\nEnormous pleasure thanks for being here let me ask you the thirty thousand foot question first and then we'll we'll start to dig deep uh how how did how did you spend the weekend how did last week strike you and where do you see this drama right now Monday October first\nI was so angry last week the way the Senate Democrats sacrificed doctor for its confidentiality the way they abuse the approval process where instead of allowing a confidential vetting they deliberately put up this letter afterwards I was furious\nSo I went home and enjoy my anniversary and didn't think about it at all\nIf you are a smart man you're a good senator and a very smart man and it was probably a very mentally healthy thing to do good for your health and good for the marriage so now we're all a oh how many years may I ask\nTwenty nine\nWell congratulations to both of you that's fair happy wife happy life is good for user so now we're back at it and I've been listening to from Chuck Schumer to Mitch McConnell sued John Cornyn whoever comes after him and it seems like we're all just sort of biding time waiting to see what the FBI find what do you think they're going to find\nI think they're going to find exactly what has already been found that Dr Ford made obviously Dr Ford at some terrible experience and she has made allegations but all for people who she says should know about it do not know about it she has a backup statement well they weren't really involved so maybe they didn't know about it\nBut at some point in our\nSystem of life not just government and other law but life\nIs for people say something didn't happen in one person says did you go before particularly when a man told reputation as on line or a woman's reputation or anybody's reputation is not about male female it's about fairness and for people said it didn't happen when she said should know that it did\nAh you just got to go with the four and so I think they help you out\nThere and I think there'll be a vote for Kavanaugh and I think you'll be approved\nSenator Bill Cassidy with us from the great state of Louisiana is there any inside buzz in the hallways about what the heck happened in that tight space with though with Jeff Flake and Chris Coons as they walked out of the hearing room that I\nKnow I don't know that um I in fact I Know they're on sixty minutes last night but I just saw them and I didn't look at it um you know I saw on the screen it was muted and I didn't use it uh because the reality is is that for people said it didn't happen\nAnd then there was a four people alleged to be witnesses and by the way\nBy the way it's like it's like Kavanaugh lived his life and such a sterling character I'm a bad that it doesn't fit a pattern either and and the Dems are trying to come up with things that would suggest there is a pattern of wrongdoing\nBut frankly not when Michael ... is your is your spokes person you know you got you you know you got and grew to go after somebody\nYou have the quota the day it was new did and I didn't earn muted transcend once we get another lesson in life from Senator Bill Cassidy so you have a Breitbart piece is pretty interesting and and it seems to be\nThat if if we got FBI probes on our mind and things we want the FBI look at it everybody wants to investigate everything you have an idea or two about something that might be investigated\nAnd that might be collusion that actually exists among Democrats to smear judge Kevin I'm\nTotally so Democrats are trying to make out like this is some sort of organic uprising of people coming out to say the judge Kavanaugh was not\nNot not credible even though the for people that they said were there set it didn't happen but this clearly is a tactic a strategy with tactics or would you smear him you create doubt you create down there for you\nBut they want to take back the Senate they'd be in ... Democrats at which point they would block a future Trump appointee by the way there was already a website for the woman Coney Barrett that was nominated it's stop I'm I'm\nA considered I'm Sorry I considered it stopped Coney Barrett dot com and it says Web site coming soon so if\nThe Trump comes up with another appointee and Kavanaugh for whatever reason I got appointed\nThey already are preparing now this is ... this is a strategy and its fooling them and they're trying to fool the American people that just have FBI going after people wait a second was this part of a strategy that you seek out someone to testify against\nJudge Kavanaugh did you deliberately not released a letter until after you knew you sacrifice doctor for its confidentiality that you do it as part of a target as part of a strategy to\nSmear judge Kavanaugh in public as opposed to have a ... that is find out mark you know I mean here of American people or they're trying to see the American people that should be turned up that should be you know if you will like cast appointed\nBy all means if if we got questions everybody wants to be asking all these questions we got a couple of questions we like to have\nAsked ourselves hey I've got a couple of remaining couple of minutes let me get greedy when you look is unreal cast and he's also in the Finance Committee big day of the White House I don't know about you as a conservative DNA and mean means that terrorists are not usually my favorite thing but doggone advantage\nThere there's maybe on the list of stuff the trumps made me a believer I mean here's Kennedy here's Mexico saying okay we're ready to play nice now how did they strike you\nKnow I think the president said Iran's said he wanted to redo NAFTA me read it and after that one more promised that he made that he is subsequently kept I think NAFTA has worked well for American workers in my state we have a positive balance of trade with Mexico\nAnd with Canada um ah you told me here from Texas you go along the border with Mexico there's so much prosperity where there once was not it's created a lot of jobs for a lot of folks in my state and across the country but that didn't need to be done and the president has already done it and he's going to take care of the American worker\nAs well as how a trade with Mexico and Canada I think it's a good thing\nHow's your what your I'm crystal ball in the midterms\n[noise] you know if the if the people are focusing upon the economy and a part of the fact that President the president made promises kept promises that I think Republicans will do okay\nWe're focused on things that are peripheral or which of course Democrats are trying to keep all focused on things that are not in a pocket book not in the kitchen table\nThen then wherever tougher time so I'm hoping the American people are focusing on my gosh my life a lot better now than it was three years ago when I go with the team that brought me the the better life\nAnd finally back into the halls of the U.S and I don't know if you have a chance to run into a man Joe Manchin Joe Donnelly Heidi Heitkamp strike you as the kind of people they voted for Gorsuch all three of them who might ultimately there's looking for a reason to get some cover to vote for Kavanaugh said that they don't get killed in their own home states\nI think you just I think if you're just being fair if you're just being fair you're going to say everybody Dr Ford says should be a witness said either don't remember or that it didn't happen\nI think the FBI will find the same thing so I'm hoping Donnelly hike camp others will say they're going to vote on the behalf of fairness shouldn't be about electoral politics it should be about what is fair to a fellow American\nAnd this will be fair to a fellow American um after both Ford and Kevin ... so unfairly by Senate Democrats so I'm hoping they vote for fairness\nSenator and Dr Bill Cassidy of Louisiana thank you sir appreciate you being on the program a much appreciate your time have a wonderful day\nMark\nYou bet senator bone density a robot senior U.S under from a kinda funny Louisiana up some
