first time in my life the extreme left is out of control joy villa\n... writes this column in USA Today she is a well known to many of course the ... the singer and songwriter\nIn fact she was at my talk at valley best shallow\nShe's a she's a black woman she is beautiful she's talented she's alive she's great she's bright she's everything\nAnd I didn't even know if she's a Republican or not a Republican and here she is the less the left is out of control I'm a public figure a new Republican I'm going to take my energy where it counts the polls you should to whether your share my views are not\nBut because he has been blessed with such wonderful opponents really I mean nobody could ask for better opponents than President Trump has received Elizabeth Warren\nReally uh we are going to now have the great one drop of Native American blood debate\nOf this entire thing is incredible and Elizabeth Warren is trying to collect at least some of the people operating her name want her to collect the million dollars President Trump has promised if she can prove she's an Indian and how does she proves she's Indian\nOr we will get to that it's deeply embarrassing and it really does show that there are some not many but some points of commonality between contemporary liberals and Nazis\nReally yes really will get to that on the Michael Medvedev show will also get to the great debate about the civil war and and again\nA President Trump ... did not showing himself when he was talking about general grant and generally to be a particularly sophisticated historian he wasn't hired for that but\nHe absolutely did not inappropriately praise a Confederate general and he shouldn't be condemned for it and the press that helped them they've shown and in fact they were forced to retreat\nExactly why it is so many Americans and it's left right and center this trust mainstream media\nAnd rightly distrust mainstream media and most of all President Trump has been blessed this week at the beginning of the week\nWith the\nUtterly inexplicable desire of Hillary Clinton to inject herself into this democratic campaign\nWhy\nThis is a mystery is she some kind of secret agent for the Republican Party is that possible\nI mean she blew the campaign kind of everybody knows that she blew the campaign against Donald Trump President Trump acknowledges it and and now she is doing her very level best\nTo uh to to basically um\nHelp President Trump and help Republicans in the forthcoming campaign this November OK Hillary Clinton was on CBS on Sunday Morning and it it's one of those things will posted up\nAt our website at Michael med dot com you really have to see it to get a a full force of how uncomfortable she looks wives submit yourself to this I I don't understand I don't understand what is possibly be gained here except to strengthen Republicans\nAnd why is that she is not a political newcomer she's been around the block a thousand times she was a problem for the first campaign to Bill Clinton lost and and people forget this this is part of ancient history\nBut Hillary and bill gotten married bill got elected to be the governor of Arkansas very young man\nAnd then when he ran for reelection the first time he lost and he lost because Hillary was the issue because she hadn't changed her name yet she was still Hillary Rodham she's still have those coke bottled glasses that I remember her wearing from law school\nAnd ah she she was a much more of an quote outspoken feminist well then she changed and she campaigned alongside bill but given the fact that she has this long long experience in the political world\nHow could you be so honestly unprepared for questions that are very obvious and this this comes especially after we spoke to Ken Starr who's an outstanding American and has just written a terrific book and again I recommend the book hardly to everybody\nThe um\nThe book by Ken Starr which has posted up at our website at Michael met a dot com tells the story of the impeachment of Bill Clinton\nAnd it tells much more tells the whole story of Ken Starr as life but it does not portray Hillary at a very positive way and when you read that book you can understand why she would be so utterly unprepared for questions like those she received on CBS listen\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill of sexual misconduct\nNone no no no well I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern today have said you should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think [noise] bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky is absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at\nThe incidents of the nineties and they say a president of United States cannot have a consensual relationship with an internal power imbalance ...\nAn adult but let me ask you this\nWhere the investigation of the current incumbent against him numerous allegations have been made and which he dismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation and it as I Believe came out in the right place\nOkay it came out in the right place for Monica did it uh it came out in the right place for those people by the way including very much Lindsey Graham who was one of the leading Republicans in the house of representatives at that time a working on impeachment\nThis is so astonishing this is eight eight utterly shameful display of what about is um\nLet let me play it for you again because you'll notice immediately that rather than talking about what was obviously an abuse of power involving a president of the United states and then in turn an intern in his office\nAs she uh doesn't come from that and she says oh well but what about Trump which you know what year is the key point and and listen to how\nHow glib elite Hillary Clinton just he lives that she just moved away from it and doesn't even touch it\nPresident Clinton was accused of miss\nBehavior the kind of behavior that would have gotten any CEO fired and so quickly so quickly you can't work for any corporation I mean anywhere today you can't even work in Hollywood\nAnd be involved and doing stuff like this and and come out the other side the accusations about Trump\nHas to do a with a period in his life long before he was directly involved in politics and certainly before he was in the White House by the way or just listen one more time and I want to come back to this because it's very very important\nAnd it's it's so crucial to make distinctions okay here's Hillary Clinton again being questioned about her record defending bill\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct\nNone no no no no I take responsibility right where my writing and my actions\nShe also stood by his side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern from today had said you should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky is absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at\nThe incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance of water\nIn adult but let me ask you this she wasn't aware twenty or nation of the current incumbent against whom numerous allegations have been made\nOf stumped stuffed up right there I think anyone including the most devoted supporters of President Trump a\nWould acknowledge that if it came out that he was having an affair with a White House intern if you were doing the things that Bill Clinton we now know did that yes President Trump should step down a bit of there is no evidence of that and I am virtually certain especially given the amount of media scrutiny of President Trump\nAnd Secret Service scrutiny and and FBI school and everything else there's nothing irregular about his sexual behavior since he has been president\nAnd see the the point over here is the failure to make distinctions in other words Hillary Clinton and liberals want us to believe that what Brett Kavanaugh did as a Seventeen year old allegedly at a party\nA is a is incredibly serious in ruins in forever and what Bill did as president of the United states and when you talk about abuse of power there's also such a thing about abuse of power involving\nThe Congress and the government and federal investigators or we will get to that and much more coming up on the ... that show\nBump Michael mad vigil last summer it's been antics than have it well I mean it\nA fanatic believes\nThat it is significant if you're able to find that if people have taken these DNA tested always turns out own you know two percent African American and one percent are from from uh Australia aboriginal I I don't think that turns up very often\nBut the the entire thing is not the only Democrats do this it's completely ridiculous why are we so obsessed with DNA there's the question here would be was was there any sense\nIn which you grew up with a meaningful identity as an Indian and she didn't\nShe was a fraud about it she ought to apologize and just move on I I Do find it embarrassing when the president used the term Pocahontas cause Pocahontas by the way was somebody of real Native American heritage who became a Christian she changed her name's Rebecca and she converted Christianity\nUm looked at President Trump was asked about these latest revelations about a\nSenator Elizabeth Warren who is getting ready to run for president that's why she released this video the timing is horrible for her because it will only heard Democrats and the forthcoming elections here's what President Trump had to say\n[noise] why\nWhy they're really\nYou're better read it again I\nIs I think it'd be very easy I also I Do not do that\nAll the various Venezuela that being said I don't want to say bad things about her because I feel that what we're going to be alone Russ ever\nIt is going to be a long process for the Democrats um that there are people who are saying uh well President Trump said he would pay a million dollars if a she could prove that she was an Indian\nNow and there are people saying well he has to pay or a million dollars now because she proved a that she may have had and one the\nIndian ancestor six to ten generations ago sorry here's exactly what President Trump said he said at a rally if I'm debating Warren I'd make our take a DNA test and pay or a million dollars if she can prove she's an Indian\nNow she can't prove that but I'll tell you one thing you can prove it Elizabeth Warren is one of those Democrats who is threatening to bankrupt and destroy our Medicare system how we'll get to that I'm an right up on the ...\nBob

control of the house of representatives the Senate should be fine that that also could be close but it should be fine and things for the house side are turning around and one of the reasons is stupid mistakes by people like Senator Elizabeth Warren and a\nFormer presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\nAnd then mainstream media in general but one of the other reasons has to do with the fact that a little bit more and as one of those people out there beating the drums for Medicare for all so for those of us who actually support Medicare and I do I\nI Know how important it is too many many many Americans are who happened\nTo be over the age of sixty five\nOr why is it that the Democrats have always claimed credit for Medicare or now posing such a grave threat to it and nobody better to talk

appealing slogan a Medicare for all really means Medicare for nobody\nWell exactly and it really is expanding up for Medicare which is a kind of an insurance when they go on to converted to his socialism plan and here's what I'm Talking about there's twenty two million Americans have Medicare Advantage plans\nThose plants this year actually having a decrease in premium because they're operated through independent insurance companies having a decrease in premium however the Bernie Sanders Medicare for all\nWhat lemonade Medicare Advantage plans and replace it with the socialism plan

thin layer Shirley Franklin and I'm In ah twenty months after serving her I was appointed to the United states are stretched it\nOnto the ministry of president Barack Obama and I was there for just under a year when I was recruited back to the city of Atlanta about the honorable America say Murray and two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay this whole story your story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success\nHow how is it you ended up whether you are say or terminate you were fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your firing\nWell a a year prior to my termination out had published a book that I had written on my own time and self publish for Christian men the book was called who told you that you were neck and just the question that got ask Adam\nIn the garden to eat and ... and I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question with Dennis this check the great birth eleven so ah so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it overcoming the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before I was suspended\nAh but the reason why I was terminated as as a cause I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purposes for sex\nAnd marriage and that God created a sex for procreation and then and and for the pleasure between a husband and I and holy matrimony and that in his sex outside of that a is a thin and ultimately that's what cost me my childhood dream come true fairy tale career\nOK Now let's get this straight you have these opinions which her opinions that literally hundreds of millions of Americans share and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men and the fire department where you\nKnow are not at all\nSo it it was the fact is you self published the book you hadn't use public funds what business is it of the city of Atlanta\nOr the mayor of the city council or anybody\nOr what the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful\nWhat was the argument for using a passage in your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city's views\nAre and that I can have those you as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city or I had an obligation to check those beliefs that the door is what one council members fit and the mayor clearly supported that position\nOkay at this point uh this I think most people are

not by firing the chief because they didn't agree with you if I didn't I didn't quite understand that but\nWe filed a lawsuit on behalf of the chief the good news is a is that we argue that the policy they actually required prior permission so they told the chief\nAfterward that oh no you can't write a book on your own time for a Bible study unless you get prior permission from the city in the city allows you to do so we chose that as being unconstitutional his only prior permission needed is the first amendment and the judge ruled with us\nThis is extraordinarily good news not for politicians

to determine\nDo you have a great deal of trust and politicians trust and confidence politicians\nDo you have a fair amount of trust and confidence in men and women in political lights life or or do you have a low amount of trust in politicians trust has been soaring here's the amazing part\nThe increase it's not only a ten year high it's seven points from a year ago\nAnd Thirteen points from the record low of forty two percent in September two thousand sixteen okay now what happened right after September two thousand sixteen\nThe election of Donald Trump is president the United states is it appropriate to feel more trust in politicians right now actually I think it is I Do\nWith all of the problems that we have in American politics and all of the conflicts we have if you're one of those people who trust politicians not at all or less than ever or you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six um\nMeanwhile I Want to get back to that\nAnd but there was a fairly remarkable interview with President Trump on sixty minutes\nI Know it's not Fox News is on Fox and friends it's not the friendly confines a president's from those at when he's going to be interviewed by Lesley Stahl who's interviewed him before and then when he was going on sixty minutes he's running CBS network is not going to get easy questions fast\nBalls or pardon me slow hanging curve balls right over the plate\nHe's going to get some fairly tough questioning and he did so how did the president do\nAre you getting the help judge for yourself up for those who did not see the sixty minutes interview which was big news last night here was a what I think was a fairly interesting inappropriate question from Lesley Stahl with the president's answer right at the beginning\nYou are the first president to the United states who never had a political post or for\nWorse never served in the military you come up here and you've been here for almost two years what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president okay so I always used to say the toughest people in Manhattan real estate guys and bubba now I say that they be\nIncluded in the political people this is the most deceptive vicious world\nIt is a vicious is full of lies deceit and deception you'd make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm not looking at in the meantime nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do\nWhen you look at taxes you look at regulations you look at um making deals with other countries [noise] nobody's been able to do anything like this actually most people don't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it but\nIt's a very deceptive world\nOkay a\nVery deceptive world um but how does that correlate with the idea that\nTrust in politicians is it a ten year high I I think it has to do with the fact that most people regardless of which side you're on can feel that it at least some of your concerns\nAre being addressed because there's so many voices in this political debate son learn a dramatic\nAnd even though we don't officially have divided government ... the Democrats haven't been shy in letting their points of view be known and by the way the poll from Gallup the show the trust in\nPoliticians at a ten year high that was taken before the accusations by Christine Blasey Ford and before the second round of the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd there's no question that those accusations took a toll particularly on confidence people hadn't in Brett Kavanaugh though I still believe that uh that entire confrontation is going to work very strongly Republicans\nAs does this general sense that believe it or not with all of the deal making the viciousness of the President Trump is talking about\nA there's a sense that the political system\nIs working a President Trump was a\nThen asked about uh the aspect of the political world that he is most routinely condemned and that of course would be as good friends and mainstream media the other thing\nReally learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was I I really made it I'm not saying that as a soundbite by now I I never knew how to just try to get to know what even the way you asked me a question like about separation that when I say Obama did it you don't want to talk of\nIt was recognized them answer but you did it four times I'm just telling you that you feed into me much differently on the subject I just I don't want to have that fight with you okay All right not if I were there at the time I'm president and you are not\nUh okay uh\nAnd and then they change continues to or a question that I think a lot of people ask about an editor mocking was used regularly that President mocked Christine Blasey Ford well Lesley Stahl picked up on that and just took it\nA little bit to the side\nProfessor of philosophy forging mimicked her\nMade a speech we would not have one that I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything you know and you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary why did you have to make fun of her\nI didn't really make fun of it as the person that we're talking about\nYou know the air and the time the place perhaps a bar they forgot before the Senate and and was asked what the worst moment and she said when the two boys who laughed at me at my ... and then I watch him and my car and\nThousands of people were laughing at her they can do what they\nWill tell you the way now justice Kevin always treated it has become a big factor\nIn the ... have you seen what's going on with the ... did you have to\nWell I think she was treated with greater respect I Know they just like what do you think there is no you shouldn't have been you'd think you treated her with great ... I just seem to be saying that she relied\n... you know what I'm not going to get into it because we won it doesn't matter\nWe won okay a look at the one\nThing that I think he was on the right track with he did not make her mimic during the her as if you try to imitate her accent or tone of voice\nHe didn't do that and that would've been horrible what she did was he talked about the ... if he didn't changes tone of voice\nHe said he said uh when that happened I don't remember where did you go I don't remember if we can have that to play that soundbite for you but this entire media narrative which I don't think is working for the left if you disagree of may and give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nThat President Trump was mocking Christine Blasey Ford that he was mimicking her mimicking is even worse\nBecause people do make people I mean I I have been known to mimic people are in perfectly sometimes but I Do a better alone it but this was not that\nAnd then uh\nThen he was asked a question that has a profound concern to Democrats here's Lesley Stahl\nAt what why not they shouldn't do it this is a terrible thing to do it you have to believe that the Russians interfered in the two thousand sixteen campaign or election I they they metal but I think China metal too and I don't I don't want to know something I said why\nYou tell me ... metal because I think China metals also and I think frankly I\nThink are probably the hurting the whole Russian ally Russia but I'm also saying\nOkay here's an Amish many\nTimes what is undoubtedly the case which has Russia interfered in the election and I think what President Trump is saying is a there is no evidence that Russia swayed\nThe election and by the way I think that's true or if you disagree you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise] any shocking\nThe way that a viscerally solve questioned the fresh\nAnd you're going to understand why he's somewhat reluctant to do these interviews we'll be right back with more what it means for the campaign and why the rise in confidence from politicians one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nYeah so I mean in other words the United states is a a world power that has wide ranging global interests and we certainly have played a role in toppling of some very evil foreign governments including a foreign government uh in in Chile or\nUnder a Salvador Allende which actually I think we were justified in and taking some role and I know that very controversial but what does that have to do this in other words if the United states is looking after our own interests uh we we oppose\nRussia's meddling in our election not because it is profoundly wrong in some kind of cosmic sense but because it hurts the United states has a hostile act and we want to stop\nIt [noise] so what's what's wrong with that\nI don't think there's I don't think there's anything really entirely wrong with us trying to question or a morality in uh in our current role in the world today but just to just to think that there are not governments that are trying to influence our our because we are one of the most powerful countries and\nThen of course there are governments that are trying to do it but uh and we are we are right to call them out on it and to try to oppose it and then again I think people are right when when a country acts abroad as apparently Saudi Arabia dead\nWhich is why do think that what people are talking about about this being some kind of rogue operation that went wrong that they were actually they're not to kill his show gay and chop them up into little pieces in Istanbul which they did\nA but to actually just apprehend them and take him back to Saudi I\nI think that is relevant as well and yes there's a difference appreciate\nYour call I'm President Trump inevitably was asked about the border by Leslie stall there was this interchange\nWhat about the for separation of children from their migrant children from the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same thing it was on the books but he didn't impress at you and for that launched that pop the zero tolerance policy\nTo deter families with children and everybody decided and courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you allow\nTo stay together\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into our country are you gonna go back\nThat well we'll see that a lot of things really what we want to do is change immigration laws because they were they were laughing stock all over the world are you willing though I think you're saying you're it's under consideration I Want all the laws change\nBecause I was just Leslie

I didn't get to our caller in Grand Rapids Michigan I Would have loved to\nBut he was making the point that President Trump did so a mock Christine Blasey Ford\nI don't think he mocked her but I Know he didn't mimic her and that was the word that Lesley Stahl use you mimic Christine Blasey Ford here's what President Trump actually sounded like a this is before the final vote obviously on judge Kavanaugh and it was a a a comment that he made during a rally in Mississippi listen\nI Wonder [noise] well do you think it was it was what I'll do it\nHow did you get home I Do remember how'd you get

narrative\nAbout what a hero when how selfless and how some noble Christine Blasey Ford\nIs I'll tell you when it's appropriate to challenge it\nCan somebody tell me what but it did for the country with Anita Hill on Clarence Thomas even though I don't believe she was telling the truth I don't\nAt least you could say she raised awareness of problems of workplace um harassment\nAnd uh and Nazis and this is not to say the Proud Boys are Nazis they're not\nBut really what are you trying to accomplish but says here let me read you one of the descriptions\nI'm\nIn Portland which has long seeing clashes between the far left in the far right\nFor two weeks they've been consumed with Brad black lives matter protests over a fatal police shooting in September those protests in turn provoked right wing groups when video emerged last weekend of demonstrators blocking traffic and beating on a passing drivers car and those videos were horrible and\nIt it's completely what was so amazing as a police didn't break it up these people were attacking motorists and\n... and by the way most of the more we're white most of the demonstrators are white and they were as a tank and motorists were being white people\nHate crime okay ah\nPortland police apparently had been expecting trouble and managed to prevent it for half an hour or so by lining up and tactical gear along the street I'm sure they love this\nBut after sundown things kicked off the anti fascist may provoke violence\nAccording to a freelance reporter who documented in swimming Malay on Twitter one of them burned an American flag as a Proud Boys and company we're leaving causing the Proud Boys to return another quote anti fascist than Dallas the entire group with pepper spray\nOkay and then it went down from there\nI might my question to folks is what you accomplished with this on either side\n\nDo you really want to make the American people hate you is there somebody out there who sees the Proud Boys rolling with the ...\nPeople and you think wow those ... people are really braver go let's hear it for the Proud Boys they've done such a great job ... honestly\nThis this is\nThis is the worst of what's going on in America right now is this idea that somehow you express your political point of view or you advance your political point of view by beating on other people\nReally\nLet's go to a your calls to Christie in Plymouth, Minnesota Christie you're on the Michael ...\nI'm ... Hi I was I guess is what I have to say I was I've been listening to your show and my hackles went up a little bit when you when you said that\nIt was just an attempt to to to block him that's all it was by her her going up there and saying what she said because\nI Know as the timing the timing why why do you think given the fact given the fact that this happens thirty six years ago and that ... has been a very public person for at least Twenty years why now\nAnd that thing that is exactly what I was going to when I was going to say because\nI don't want this man on the Supreme Court deciding things that have to do with rape cases per se and and ... that that will that will very possibly look at rural rural hurts it you know all the way that that in law is a is a I\nI was away from you how often you know I don't well hold on I don't hold on just helped me logically want just something that he allegedly did when he was Seventeen but he denies and nobody else says he did it it's just her\nWhat does her charge against him when he was Seventeen has to do with real v Wade\nNo it doesn't have anything to do it throw me wait what I'm saying is he he's going to be on the Supreme Court which could decide lies bike for all the way that would be influential and two women that is what I was getting at but\nWhen you said too when I Know why we move on I don't know I don't hold on roe v Wade is first of all it's not a law roe v Wade is a court case and I understand it can lead he has repeatedly answered questions about roe v way than he has said he considers to be settled law\nAnd I I don't I don't understand in other words do you think that the fact that if it was somebody else's name wasn't cabin on somebody else who is accused of misbehavior when he's Seventeen years old that should disqualify him from ever serving on the Supreme Court\nAt absolute it's something that if it's something that like for example she he talked about this in her therapy sessions seven years ago\nYeah but usually early years after it was it's it's still Thirty years after it happened and Kavanaugh was already famous seven years ago and talking about a year therapy Sessions is very

there's almost nobody better\nThan Bill Maher when it comes to calling out his fellow liberals\nFor their inane absurd and disgusting political correctness\nWhich is one of the reasons that I Believe Republicans will prevail in these upcoming collections Americans are sick of it we covered\nThis study that had been featured a by a Harvard professor in Atlantic magazine a study that shows that Americans across the spectrum including liberals and\nConservatives and moderates and blacks and whites and young and old and the highly educated in the not so highly educated\nEverybody believes that political correctness is a problem in this country eighty percent\nAnd it's a even higher percentages of Latino people in Asian people people who normally skew quote liberal on the political spectrum\nAnd Bill Maher I think understands some of the dangers he said on his show over the weekend this\nPolitical correctness I Believe that would destroy them of I Believe that now\nAnd I think people vote not so much on policy anymore I don't think they followed closely I think they vote on who's wrong they know Trump's ... but he looks strong\nAnd political correctness week eighty percent to this new Atlantic story that for Bush this whole eighty percent of Americans the political correctness as a problem\nAnd I think it's our problem and I don't know why more mainstream liberals don't denounced the political correct is that they must know in private conversations isn't saying\nOK eight he's\nEntirely correct and there are so many examples about it uh and and some of the examples or alluded to I think effectively by Bill Maher\nBut it's like ten stories a week let me just go to Scott ... what are you familiar the Austria okay he tweeted one of the greatest leaders of modern time
