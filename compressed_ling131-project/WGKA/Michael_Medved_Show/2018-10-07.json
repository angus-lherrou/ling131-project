[laughter]\nI Will probably not even try to to find what ... means right ah we've really lowered ourself or in a new way when the members of the Senate Judiciary committee\nOr try to interpret a sixteen year old musing a in a high school yearbook it's beyond anything I've ever seen\nBy the way there are a a serious as a serious letter to the Judiciary Committee by ... and his association of alumni of Georgetown Prep\nAs to the real honest to goodness meaning of devil's triangle we will get to that I don't want to take your time for it but let me ask you this governor I eat you were of course earlier in life a very successful Baptist pastor\nOr are you richly encouraged by the new found democratic uh eagerness to make war on alcohol abuse\nOr you know listening to some of the Democrats last week I thought I was listening to the reincarnation of carry nations and uh I was expecting them to all bring out an ax and go and and tear down the saloons of DC I I've never seen structure piracy in my life\nAnd it was it was embarrassing to watch and and to realize that the same party that are covered over people like Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd who wants took a waitress at a restaurant in DC and literally through her onto a table while they were in a drunken state\nNever got charged for it humiliated the poor young lady uh that the party of those kind of ethics uh would dare try to ah to tell a Brett Kavanaugh that what he did in high school and then his college days made him unfit to be on the Supreme Court\nYou I I Know in both your races for the presidency one one of the themes that that you stressed was trying to bring America together\nAnd to heal some of the bitterness and a renewal of the spirit the spirit of Brotherhood and amity and right now they're just I'm a part of the news coverage is the literally thousands of anti Kavanaugh demonstrators in protests were swarming over Capitol Hill\nWhat would you say to people like that assuming that we when victory or on this confirmation this weekend\n[noise] well I Would quote to them to have their favorite a political figures I Would quote Iraq Obama who reminded us a rather bluntly that elections have consequences and he's right\nAnd then I Would remind them of the words of Hillary Clinton in October twenty six dangerous before the election\nWhen she said that it would be a real threat to our constitution and to our democratic system if someone lost the presidency and refused to accept the results of the voters are these are two very important things that I Would love for\nUh people on the left to think about it and don't take my word for it\nOr take the word of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama\nBecause Michael I Believe that the fundamental underlying issue that we've seen over the last few weeks with this Kavanaugh issue and frankly over the entirety of Donald Trump's presidency is this the other side has refused to accept\nThe results of the election and there are a lot of things our country this great Republican bars confer survive we can survive pendulum swings from the right and the left we can survive bad court decisions we can survive\nBad policy decisions and and even a spiraling debt that at times will threaten our economy but there's one thing that we can't survive and that is that if\nA group of citizens significant group numbering almost a half the country refuses to accept the consequences and the results of a duly held election then now we're on the dangerous a thin ice\nOf destroying what makes us or nation and we can't have it that way we're living the time or a lot of kids grow up thinking everybody gets a trophy nobody loses we better shake ourselves out of that yes we do lose I've run for the presidency twice I didn't lose I mean I didn't when I lost but can you imagine what it would have been like if ... ... ...\nAh the remaining years of our life going around and saying I really one I'm going to go into the White House any way I should be the president of the one who's there is not legitimate\nOr they would put me away for life in should\nUh-huh well ... ... again right now you're not in the White House but your daughter Sarah is she is the president's press secretary and the other day she was defending the president I think very appropriately and I I've been very critical about President Trump on a number of things\nBut I don't believe that he was mocking uh Christine last before when\nHe he pointed out the truth which is that she has had very contradictory and evasive things to say when it comes to corroborating her story\nAnd uh your your daughter Sarah told the press that hey you had President Trump was just reporting the facts and then a Jim Acosta challenged her and that sounded like this and their final interchange\nThose savings I Know he probably do\nA need to think that was in a moment that made you a pound papa\nA there are lots of moments that do and that was certainly one of them anytime that she uh puts Jim Acosta in his place I kinda think that it's it's like watching her discipline or her three children who are six five and three\nAnd I I think dealing with the Costa is a really easy for her 'cause she she's basically dealing with someone who acts like he's five or six or three years old\nOkay I one of the things that I wanted to get a quick response and this is not to get you in trouble Governor Huckabee but Lindsey Graham has inspired so many new admirers are so many new supporters because at his very very strong\nOr support I'm not just for a judge Kavanaugh but for the Trump agenda generally\nAnd part of the talk right now is I'm a vet Lindsey taking a more of a role not just as chairman of the Judiciary Committee which I think is very likely a but perhaps\nAs the next attorney general of the United states a given the fact that he does have a great deal of legal experiences the prosecutor and of course experience with the Senate he could also get confirmed as a new attorney general what do you think\nWell I think it would be a great idea I I Love Jeff Sessions when he was named to happen to be in Trump Tower when he was there and meeting with the president then the president elect we had a great conversation I told him how ecstatic I was and thought it was a wonderful decision\nUh but I've been very disappointed I I Will be honest and say I just don't know what happened to the Jeff Sessions that I\nHave known and a few like that or maybe he went native he got over there and the agency and they capture them and he has experienced the Stockholm syndrome which happens to a lot of people who get into these agencies I don't know that's what happened\nBut I Know that he has not been the guy that I thought he was going to be and taking the Hoover vacuum cleaner to uh the de OJ and the FBI\nYou don't mean the J Edgar Hoover vacuum cleaner [laughter]\nGood one [noise] um no but I I just feel like that he's he hears loud the agency to run him rather than him run the agency and that's been very unfortunate ... grand has become a rock star now I've always like Lindsey but one thing I liked about him is that he's a very straightforward honest\nGuy if he's ... he's with even if he's not he's honest about it\n[noise] you know all Trump had their moments but you know what a once he's one of the greatest assets the president has\nI I certainly agree with you about\nA Mike Huckabee his ah TBN show wildly successful we'll be right back with your reaction to this moment uh we've had the Kavanaugh crisis whereabouts have the calving off line max\nIf you want to speak for the demonstrators if you share some of their anguish and their occupation of the heart a dream Senate office building I clearly if they're going to try to disrupt the business the United States Senate\nThey will have to be cleared away and arrested and what is it they are demonstrating for here\nOne exactly one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and Lindsey Graham spoke out clearly as he has been doing basically his whole career\nBut he had this to say about the FBI investigation that was just completed listen\nI'm confident the FBI did a good job\nThey were not or hindered in anyway [noise]\nAh the focus of the background check was all credible allegations before the committee [noise]\nUh I was looking for certain things to be answered by witnesses [noise]\nThat what the committee found is held off and then some [noise] the main thing for me\nIs that you need to go to the FBI\nAnd you need to ask them [noise]\nDid they feel like they were able to do their job without it for us and I think the answer is yes [noise]\nThey interviewed over a hundred and fifty facelift interview throughout the course of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nDecision for our interviews [noise] no evidence of that so manufacturers [noise]\nSenators who requested the supplemental\nFBI background check out what they read [noise]\nOkay are they are ready to vote they are going to be voting tomorrow on a procedural question which is going to be to advance the nomination to the Senate floor and apparently the final vote on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to be adjusted to the Supreme Court\nWill occur on Saturday Susan Collins and Jeff Flake of both said they're very satisfied with the with the FBI investigation and that's an indication that they are probably going to be be necessary margin\nBecause that would have um [noise] even without Senator Murkowski even now senator mentioned that would give Brett\nKavanaugh the fifty votes he needs but wouldn't it be better if the one with fifty to a ... it will get to your calls a and your reactions to the demonstrators and the president from a

by the way he's doing fine and has a re election bid I Hope he does not get reelected I Hope that Patrick Morrisey who's the attorney general west Virginian will be a find US Senator ... these Joe mansion but the polls show that he's running while I had\nA I think he would secure his re election if he voted yes on cabinet because Kavanaugh's nomination is popular in West Virginia Trump carried West Virginia by forty point but um my guess is this\nIs somehow two of the three Republicans vote in the wrong direction that Susan Collins and Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski of two of the three of those vote no\nUm then ah\nThen mansion would be the deciding vote\nBut if two of the three Republicans vote yes then mentioned mention is just the gravy he's just I'm a frosting on the cake\nAnd I think she will vote yes because it will help him politically and it will cost the Democrats anything and they won't be angry at him the one thing that I think is enormously likely is on the anti cabin on protestors\nSpelling stop him with their bodies in front of the court house\nWhich courthouse others in Portland, Oregon I see\nOkay great I the ... wonderful stop him how why do you think that they could give a good argument on a constitutional basis day let's go to ... in Los Angeles Eli you're on the Michael ...\nHigh high will be there I mean they are protesting left that or why I\nIs that someone says look I I get to decide a lot of things as a justice of the Supreme Court but I don't get to make new legislation or creed or discover new rights that no one ever suspected existed before\nThat's refreshing and it's worth supporting and I think it's um it's very much\nA force in unifying the Republican Party the Republican Party hasn't been so unified on any issue\nNot even the tax cuts though they did go through\nThis issue I think is unified conservative sentiments across the board number one because Brett Kavanaugh isn't good man and an outstanding judge who by the way who's judgment and been affirmed by the Supreme Court in the past\nThe record number of them\nIs a been a very successful judge so far he's a good man the other reason is unified the Republican Party is because the Democratic assault\nHas been so despicable and it has been despicable and childish and demeaning\nI Do think there's going to motivate Republicans to turn out to care about this election and it should\nAnd with any hope it all it after all the hysteria will discouraged Democrats\nThe um [noise] this is breaking from ... on the mid term elections\nJust breaking just released

don't I only make viewpoints\nBut I Would say Benjamin ... column really expressed as my opinion a lot of conservatives out there who would agree with me at the political capital being spent on Kavanaugh isn't worth it and it's not changing my number but Michael I'm not voting for the Democrats are not voting Republican you buy them\nAnd it pains me it pains me to say this is a lifelong

senator from Delaware who's been he he actually is a good friend of Jeff Flake of Arizona and it was they together who added this extra weight to the process so the FBI could complete his investigation which they did\nLast night the Republicans are pointing out that there is nothing new in the investigation which is a vindication of uh\nAnd having all the Democrats are claiming as was entirely predictable that the investigation is incomplete and it's insufficient the whole point of the investigation was not to find new information it was to make Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski the three wavering Republicans feel\nComfortable enough with uh having\nGiven the process some time and some information and getting reports from witnesses particularly mark judge who was interviewed by the FBI extensively to get enough information from these people so they can feel comfortable voting to sustain\nThe Republican Senate majority which means voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd uh I Believe and and certainly hope an ardent leap pray that all three of the wavering Republicans perhaps joined by Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nWill vote for confirmation giving him a a victory or by probably a vote of fifty two forty eight maybe fifty one to forty nine\nIf you disagree with me that this is a\nA positive development and will help our politics he'll and I think it

investigation from the get go\nOkay uh uh investigate investigate investigate I've I think one of the things that his clarifying about this whole process\nIs that it is giving people a little bit of a taste of what America would be like if the Democrats do take control of the house of representatives if you like this\nIf you like hearing from a various aggrieved Democrats making wild accusations trying to\nA practice the politics of personal destruction trying for a massive and comprehensive investigations of what the terms blue thing in devil's triangle really meant to high school students in Nineteen eighty two if you believe this is the kind of endeavor\nIn which our representatives in Congress should be engaged Daniel votes the Democrats\nAnd cause you'll be getting lots lots lots more of this and they win this thing the one of the reasons that I think that Republicans have been so unified and so energized by this whole process\nIs because there's an understanding people right now they're not attacking Donald Trump Donald Trump I mean he attacks back and he says things sometimes that are stupid says things sometimes\nThat are not true but that is not Brett Kavanaugh for goodness sake\nBrett Kavanaugh's entire record is one of mainstream conservatism of judicial excellence of support from people who don't agree with them building coalitions and that's exactly why they're afraid of him on the Supreme Court\nJudge Kavanaugh has a good relationship with Elena Kagan an Obama appointee associate justice of the Supreme\nCourt how do we know because she says so she was the one when she was dean of Harvard law school who appointed Brett Kavanaugh to change their\nAnd if they are going to go after Brett Kavanaugh who does build coalitions who works with other people who has a life long record of impressing people positively men and women and black and white and liberal and conservative if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh and make him into some kind of cartoon villain\nMake him into some kind of serial rapist stumbling drunk I mean none of this is true\nAnd it's the worst kind of politics it's despicable politics and people talk about is that the democracy this kind of politics is more of a threat to democracy than all of President Trump's stupid tweets combine then there are plenty of stupid tweets\nAnd the idea that a President Trump is going to permanently alienate female voters it's it's\nNot true President Trump in the last election won a majority of white female voters truly didn't win his big majorities Romney did\nBuddy won a majority and the the idea that\nThat the Democrats are trying polarization to separate eight women out and say ... women have to vote like well then see how that worked for Hillary Clinton\n... and the answer is it didn't and I believe that this democratic strategy is divisive\nAnd awful\nAnd ah that the American people are waking up to its dangers and to um to to try to to stop at ... here's a disagreeing email that came in from Brian in Compton, California\nOr his message to me is judge ... guilty where there is smoke there's fire you Republicans whitewash everything\nIt's clear as a twenty year investigator for the state which includes sexual assault cases rape that's after I interviewed over thirty plus pick another candidate Andrew BS comment about his demeanor court versus private that's ridiculous my comment was this\nHe was at the committee as a witness not as a presiding judge\nThere is no evidence at all that as the presiding judge or as it's someone functioning in a courtroom capacity he has never shown any problems with his temperament\nHere's a functioning alcoholic pick somebody else\nHe set himself he is\nBiased really and you are going to make him a judge long as the bias is for your side it's fine these a fax cover up and deceit\nNo hearing from Merrick Garland there we go that show your biased and lack of fairness nothing can beat that\nUm [noise] I again a Merrick Garland good man by the way\nIt you know that there is one of the things that is appalling in this country and that we need to continue to make progress on we've made some progress\nIs the high rate of crime against black people but nearly all of that crime nearly all of it or the overwhelming majority and it's over Ninety percent is perpetrated by other black people and that was the reason that I was speaking about that now when they go to your point about judge Kavanaugh\nDo I know that he is telling the truth or in in terms of his denials about what happened allegedly to Dr Ford I don't know for certain diseases telling the truth but I think the absence of any confirming evidence\nAt all is overwhelming\nAnd the whole way that her accusations against him came out or very suspect\nAnd ... and\nBy the way it is impossible to remove this from a political context\nAnd the reason I feel so outraged about judge Kavanaugh is he really did appear to be the ideal nominee I don't know and I've never met him but I Do know people who have worked with him closely and they have the highest regard for him including people who are only a left\nUm appeal Reed Amar who's against on the show recently is a professor of law at Yale who has had interaction with the judge capital in the classroom and otherwise\nAnd he's a liberal he was very active in the Hillary Clinton campaign he strongly supports judge Kavanaugh's nomination and\nThe notion that he should be blocked from the Supreme Court based on on early unsupported\nUnprecedented accusations against him seems to me a profound wrong because one of the things that you know about people who are sexual predators real sexual predators and people who commit sexual assault and rape and and uh at end\nViolence against women most of those people do it as a pattern it's not a one off and the idea that the other accusations against\nA judge Kavanaugh other than a doctor for it are completely non credible and I've been clearly denied or that I think is worth taking into consideration of coming up [noise]\nVery prominent Republican speaks to\nA group of protesters them to be

public service and success how how is it you ended up whether you are say your attorney you were fired\nWas it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your firing\nWell a a year prior to my termination I had published a book that I had written on my own time and self publish full Christian me in the book was called\nWho told you that you were neck

titled who tells you that your neck it\nOvercoming the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before I was suspended ah but the reason why I was terminated this was a cause I spent

published the book he hadn't use public funds what business is that of the city of Atlanta\nOr the mayor of the city council or anybody or what the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument for using a passage in your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city's views\nAre and that I can have those views as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city or I had an obligation to check those beliefs that the door is what one council members get and the mayor clearly

R. I. is calling attention to its American history book project which highlights biased an inaccurate rendering of American history for students the boat causing the most concern right now is entitled the American pageant it's a book used by millions of high school and college students for decades\nSo why does this textbook raised particular concerns is this an isolated incident or one of many and what can actually be done about something like this will discuss all those questions and Dan thanks very much for being with us there\n... beer\nFirst let's start with a brief explanation of why you launched the American history book project or how big of a problem as\nWell it's a major problem um there are dozens of American history textbooks use throughout the country\nThe way a took a look at them and decided that the American pageant was probably one of the four most widely used textbooks [laughter] it's a little hard to get the number so you can't really pin that kind of stuff down but it is widely used and is widely used in a piece of history courses which means that\nUh so the best of the brightest of students to read this textbook or a lot of the raid this Dutch voters so some of our best to get a very warped view of American history and so we thought this was a good book to tackle first we okay go on and ... but you have to begin somewhere so we began with this one\n[laughter] how do you determine what's biased and and what's just maybe not quite right\nThat's a fair question because there's a lot of [noise] says a lot of history and there are a lot of facts\nUm and and so inevitably you wind up making a ... but ... and some of the stuff is very exciting and so it's not but ... says things like transcontinental railroad building was so costly and risque\nAs to require government subsidies but of course that's that's simply not correct um because uh although some of the railroad billed as bad as it is I'm Jay and Jay Hill who ... who built the great northern railroaded to receive no federal subs is at all\nAnd it was so successful at it was only transcontinental railroad not alone in the panic of it it can Ninety three so I'm simply factually wrong but also if you read the rest of the job but you understand that the officers have a bias\nAgainst private industry in favor of government at all is really a textbook in favor of government regulations\nSo they talk about how wonderful government regulation was at the end of it and how how ... was able to tame the barons of American industry for the better really consume as well that's just that's just as a true but it but it's also it's really not true\nIs also a biased in favor of a lot of money and the guest private industry\nWe should point out that on the website you go chapter by chapter in this book highlighting different pieces of the text and explaining why it's biased in many cases why it's also inaccurate\nIs there any particular passage in the American pageant that stands out to you\nKnow my favorite is not just biases inaccuracy is they want an algae his\nUm they say algae his was uh being chased by an ambitious red hunter who is Richard Nixon and then they say that algae his uh went to trial and it was caught in a barrel sing falls towards well she was going to embarrass voltage indeed denied that he was a communist supply\nThey ah they proved otherwise a statute of limitations had run\nA convict him as a spy so the ...\nCharge the government could get on it was perjury [laughter] the government of perjury and sent to jail for\nFor five or ten years but he was denying that it was a Soviet Asian passing documents to the Soviet Union so you know the book we critique was published in two thousand two I think it is not fair to say\nThat even in two thousand two serious people thought\nThat out to his was recording embarrassing all sorts but since that time they issued a number revisions the most recent one\nBeing the sixteenth edition published in two thousand Fifteen and the passage on out to his has not been changed so they'll still stay still sang in two thousand Fifteen they did go to the charge thirty two hundred dollars for that algae his was caught an embarrassing for all sorts when in fact he was a common is why we\nSee surveys from time to time about what the American public in general doesn't know about our founding in about American history we see it from the ride I think the inter bleach and Studies Institute has a survey that they do we just had one this past week from the Woodrow Wilson national fellowship foundation which reported that only Thirteen percent of those surveys\nKnew when the U.S constitution was ratified more than half didn't know which countries the United states fought in World War two sixty percent and fifty seven percent you know how many justices serve on the nation's\nHighest court so uh two two questions here what's the impact on our young people and how do you think it's impacting how young people are engaging in our actual political debates\nThose students do go on to become a American history buffs and my guess is they forget most of what they learn very quickly but they have a sense I think\nUm after reading textbooks like this that business is bad and it is good but it will protect you against greedy biz as bad as they grow up with a with a bias against business and against the economic power\nOf the United states is a which you know even if you're not reading the text books we just go to our website true American history not us\nAnd read the commentary and get a sense of the issue and the problems dealing with text books I read a book about a useless education is by somebody and I forgot the name of the book was but he said they've survey college turtles and some like fourteen percent of them I was a graduate of\nThe nation's colleges didn't know whether the sun revolves around revolved around the sun\nSo we have a problem with education but it's not limited to American history Leslie\nWhat do you hope this project accomplishes what can people actually do to make sure that students are getting an accurate view of American history\nI think two things one is a a lawsuit who said the resources available\nAs they can read it and even if that reading\nA different history book not the American patch which is one we have ... dad\nTrue American history taught us but even if they're reading it different\nAmerican history textbook they could sign on to our website and type in the ... the name of whatever the person who is being criticized as and go to a sexually and get the scoop so it's useful even for people who [noise]\nWho are reading a different textbooks and then it's also interesting for people who\nBought or do something about American history and about bias in textbooks that could read through critique instead of reading the textbooks and we're hoping that it is sort of a warning shot fired across the bow of people who write American history textbooks that put them on notice that\nAnd we hope to put that textbook on the Web to for tickets away refer to the American pageant\nWill have to leave it there thank you very much for your time today we appreciate it\nThank you Daniel Oliver is chairman of the education and research Institute I'm going to run this reporting on radio America\nLiberty nation

[noise]\n\nI think that our male clinic ... minutes I knew the million\nThe U.S department of health and Human Services they lean that everyone age fifty year old or were screened regularly sixty percent of death from color rectal cancer can be prevented\nColorectal cancer has often been called the most preventable but least prevented the cancer\nBy Dr John chemicals that is because only fifty to sixty five percent of people take part in screening programs and the time to do that is before you have symptoms because\nOnce symptoms develop any they can be non specific and B it's usually going to be an advanced age and harder to treat a or even not curable and that's why we really emphasize that people come in for preventative screening exam when they're feeling well\nThere transfer or conversion to the dark side is complete with this sort of aggressive advertising that's just basically sort of a Democrat a party advertising really is what it reads to me as a\nMeans of the ACLU is

of the [noise] the great work that they've done in this country a security freedom of speech for all of us and it's a really a a it's a debt that we should all more\nReal quick just about a minute left dinner in our conversation here Scott I'm let's talk about the police the police officer who caused a fatal accident by driving it reckless speeds to catch a driver for a routine traffic stop and later pleaded guilty to to their homicide\nCannot be sued by the surviving victim under a state created danger theory but the outcome will be different in similar cases going forward a federal appeals court has ruled\nIn this decision and one of the judges on this panel Ken Jordan also\nSaid that as a result of the ruling police officers would now be on notice that they can be held liable for constitutional claims if they're involved in high speed chase is quote police officers\nNow have fair warning that their conduct when engaged in the high speed pursuit will be subject to the full body of our state created danger case law that law clearly establishes that the level of culpability required to shock the conscience exist\nOn the spectrum tied to the amount of time a government official has to act\nIn the police pursuit contacts that it's also necessary to take into consideration the officers justification for engaging in the ... so what's the significance here\nUntil this ruling if a cop did whatever he did in in a high speed chase he couldn't be sued for it this ruling says no he has to exercise do care and recklessness and he can't go on a hundred mile an hour chase in a busy road on winding turns against somebody\nWho uh exceeded the speed limit by a tick or two without increasing liability himself I think it's a great change and will lead to less dangerous actions on the part of the police against the public\nHow do we decide which infractions do not warrant a high speed perhaps a reckless chases and which ones do\nIt's a sliding scale and it's up to the court will examine all the factors involved if you have a shooting in hot pursuit that's one thing in this case somebody was alleged to have improperly past\nAnd the police officer went on a wild chase and killed a woman and it's a shame that that that family won't be able to recover but future families in the face of this kind of police recklessness and abused will be able to recover\nGreat to be with

for my only disrupting a scheduled speaking event so what was your reaction to that\nWell a board and frankly I mean it's absolutely typical I was certainly not surprised because\nUh the idea that a student to get to check off multiple boxes of victimhood on a college campus catch a break every rule of civility and respect\nIs by now absolutely standard uh the Sacco here enabling this outbreak of forest of violence in the ... the administrators enable at uh the only thing about the Claremont experience was\nThat fact as you say Greg that there were a handful of students who suffered a temporary suspension\nFrom classes everywhere else uh in cases of similar a outrageous behavior presidents of actually saying the students are making them feel proud of their student body at Yale after one of the most egregious incidence of\nA just a fascist behavior conferred a racial reconciliation prize on two of the participants so we are we are breathing students or who have\nNo understanding of civil discourse but even worse than that\nGreg they are being taught to think of themselves as victims of ubiquitous racism and sexism [laughter] that's\nA lie a but they're bringing that perspective with them into the world and transforming virtually all of our mainstream institutions are accordingly\nGather the liberal campus or the university campus for the most part has been a hallmark of liberalism for pretty much fifty years now if not longer in some cases\nAnd wants to the protest generation and the flower children got to be teachers and administrators and so forth uh it's it's understandable that it's become a a liberal place than in most places around the country and perhaps increasingly liberal", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city":
