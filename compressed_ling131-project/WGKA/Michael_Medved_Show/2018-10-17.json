funeral and use only hooligans would would would respect the often the vice presidency and they would resist\nThe goofy net for a couple of hours we couldn't do it we couldn't do it because when you're in the room I get goofy you get goofy we have a lot of fun but honestly the vice president he really did enjoy the set of the number of times\nIs that we've got to make this an annual thing or because he he actually enjoyed the the goofy ... you know I I was worried about ...\n[laughter] I think he was taking care of the time why am I here you know what's good for your book Donald drain the swamp by Eric ... is the illustrator\nHe not only is he the illustrator but I wrote it with him Tim ragweed I or creative partners we've done a number of books together people look it up online some of the most beautiful illustrations you've ever seen or his books but when I\nReally was thinking about who do I vote he's the guy that convinced me to take Trump's seriously he said this guy is a folk hero he's an American folk hero\nAnd that's what gave me the idea to write the book Donald drained the swamp I said he's a larger than life figure I Need to write a kids' book or a or I mean this is the kids but but it's also humor book for adults in other words adults are going to find humor in this children's book\nThat kids aren't going to find I mean obviously there's a there's a little blue bird that tweets a there is a there's somebody you know the first swamp creature is the lobbyists or is I mean kids are not going to get that and uh and then there's another swamp creature that looks a heck of a lot\nLike a cry and Chuck I don't know if you've heard of crying Chuck but he's a senator for yeah sure yeah are there to them to George and then there's the the the biggest bad a swamp creature of them all the Georgia saw us\nAnd you know adults will get that but kids I think I'm\nPart of his book really is that I think we who have supported this president we need to have some fun we need to celebrate\nAnd we need to have something a narrative that's a positive narrative about what's going on we don't need to be in the weeds every day with all the details and everything we need to just say something good is happening in America and by the way most people understand that we're being reconnected to our government were never supposed to have a big bloated\nBureaucracy we're supposed to be a free people who govern ourselves\nThat's what this big his book is all about and I really think it's important that we remind ourselves with that and that we teach our kids what that is and so this is a fable about American style self government\nFeaturing a caveman name Donald and the swamp creatures and all that kind of stuff I mean I have to say it's sweet it's innocent it's not mean spirited so I Hope people will will will use it to teach their kids but also just for adults to have fun I think a lot of adults are going to give this to other adults I Hope\nConservative adults will give it to a to they're never Trump or friends you know just as a joke or something because it is not mean spirited meant for us all to to laugh\nNow it's it's total for them it's called Donald drink drain the swamp it's probably the only book or at least be only one line or certainly a for a plug positive you president\nAnd it's just a in a very fun way it's ... it's a Donald the caveman Bull Run as if there's a series of bottled became ... years\nGoing on I think the next one is going to be Donald build the wall or whether Congress gives them funding or not\nOr you know that kind of thing but I'm I think there will be other books he lives in Michael in del up my pillow we're creating pillows based on this book that's not a joke that's actually true we're creating a plush now it's going to go it's getting crazy done is it's getting crazy but people once you buy your make America great hat\nYou know ... that's about it right and so I thought we need to have something just a fun thing or you know so we can celebrate what is happening and it's not it's not a bitter thing it's it's meant that the bipartisan swamp if you're a careful reader of the illustrations I Can't get too specific but\nIt's a bipartisan swamp and you know it's it's meant to be happy and fun while it is\nAbsolutely aren't going to be regarded McDonald's ... what what caused you to even come up with this idea well\nHonestly I\nI was mentioning Tim rag when he's he's my friend of Thirty years and he's the one that that really made me see that I that I was missing something with Trump he said this guy's a folk hero and Tim and I've written all these children's books together and after the election I thought you know what I Wonder holy cow I should write a book with him\nLike a kids' book for ... with Donald as a folk hero I didn't know what the idea was but it just kind of jumped into my head like ideas sometimes do and I knew immediately it was a good idea and I had to do it but I didn't know what it was going to be and I kept talking to him about it and he wasn't getting it and I saw\nThis doesn't make sense he's the guy that that made me understand

about fulfilling something that I had been pushing for for a while on this show and I'm very glad to see it it's a cold and across the board budget cuts spending cuts\nFor every federal departments that President Trump is apparently planning to demand and as president he can demand that are starting tomorrow and that is appropriate meanwhile continued ramifications about this horrible murder\nIn Turkey and it appears pretty obvious that it was a murder is Trump responsible that's what a lot of people on the left and in the media ... sometimes means the same thing\nAre saying uh plus uh we we really do need to go to\nSome of the other media stories\nAbout media malfunctions including an attempt to us lime a great American just moments after he died or we will get to all of that on the ... show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nFirst off this very positive story or and and again it's a story not based upon\nA conservative source it's based upon the world Economic Forum\nWhich every year does rating in terms of the most competitive countries in the world\nAnd the U.S had not been doing badly compared to most other countries in the world we've been fairly competitive but we moved up very dramatically and we are now number one of the story is it's covered in ah on line of the wall Street Journal\nOr is US's world's most competitive economy for the first time in a decade the last time we were the world's most competitive economy was two thousand eight\nWhat us two thousand and they'd have in common with a two thousand sixteen Republican presidents and yes that does make a difference when you have a pro business guy in charge\nThe U.S is back on top of the most competitive economy in the world regaining the number one spot for the first time since two thousand eight an index produced by the world Economic Forum which said the country could still do better on social issues okay\nAmerican climbed one place in the rankings of a hundred and forty countries with a top five rounded out by Singapore number to Germany number three Switzerland number four and Japan number five oh five countries scores rose from two thousand Seventeen with us not seeing the second\nBiggest gain after Japan's\nNow all of this is good news is good news for us that Germany is more competitive that Switzerland is more competitive particularly that Japan is more competitive these are American allies and I know Swiss\nSwitzerland supposed to be not aligned neutral it's effectively because of trade and economic matters it's an American ally it's tied into the west the top spot hasn't gone to the U.S since the financial crisis of two thousand and they sold out put and triggered a global economic slowdown\nEconomic recovery is well underway with the global economy projected to grow almost four percent in two thousand Eighteen in two thousand Nineteen said the report\nThat uh was published a last night\nBy the organization that produces the dominos conference on global politics and economics okay you might say well what does this have to do with my life everything because a more competitive economy means more jobs that means higher wages and means more prosperity it means more freedom\nBecause frankly if you'll have more options in terms of the jobs you look for in the way that you are in your living and the way that you can invest what ever\nDollars you can save if if you have more choices that is the equivalent to more freedom\nAnd then there's this uh President Trump actually just talked about this at a a White House meeting and a ... this is uh what what President Trump he gives me it was just held an ounce in advance\nThat he was going to make a demand from his cabinet secretaries\nAnd here is what that demand sounded like just moments ago I'm\nEach of you to come back with a five percent budget cuts [noise] from fuel various departments whether it's a secretary of administrative whatever\nI Would ask everybody to come back with a five percent cuts or are they actually they I think it will be able to do with their baby a special exemption perhaps\nWho that exemption would be if you can do more than five some of you will say hey I can do much for the uh\nI've heard about the penny for\nFifteen Years one penny\nEvery year for a dollar one very every year after four or five years the countries in good shape\nOf a say with the petty ... five but it but\nI think you can do it so I'd like to have everyone who said he went on the table\nFor your incredible domains you've presided over so bravely in some cases some cases very well some cases ... [noise]\nI Would like you to come back with a a\nFive percent cut [noise] get rid of the fat that heard of the way\nThat I'm sure you can do it I'm sure everybody has to say look at those\nOkay this is terrific and this is one of the best moments for the president so far in my opinion\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the only thing that I Would add and and I feel kind of an bowling to do this because this is something that we've talked about on the show was of that recently we've talked about a month ago it was necessary it was great the president is right on target\nThere's one thing you could add which is I'm going to set the example\nAnd I'm going to ... my White House budget I'm going to kind of right now and we're going to come back to you at the same time on all of you to come back and show them not cutting just five percent I'm cutting ten percent and by the way it is easy to cut the White House budget by ten percent\nThere too many darn people who work in the White House near stumbling over one another by the way one of the good things about Trump is he has an appointed people to fill all of those useless jobs at the White House Wednesday useless jobs you have a whole offices with a director\nAnd then an associate director and then various secretaries for things like the office of White House liaison to this disabled community now this is not that this the disabled community\nBut there's no reason there are other government departments the deal with that health and Human Services has a huge commitment of that\nYou don't need a special White House office there is a special White House office was established by President Clinton to deal with the algae Beatty community why it's not necessary\nThat doesn't mean that act that should be divide the denied the algae Beatty people look there's this special White House office to deal with the Jewish community\nAnd I benefited from it because I'm during the Bush administration they would have a Hanukkah party and it was a lovely thing\nKeep up the Hanukkah party but you don't need a special White House liaison you don't need a special White House of Ponte you don't need somebody drawing a government salary they can talk this back we have a deficit right now seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars it went up Seventeen percent since last year it's not because of the Republican tax cuts\nIf you actually look at this and you read some of the hysterical democratic articles\nThey make it clear revenues have not gone down sharply if anything they may have gone up very slightly they basically been stable was gone up has been spending\nAnd yes it's true as Mitch McConnell made the point yesterday that much of that spending about half of it is three big federal programs Mitch McConnell made a little bit of missed it but he said that the Seventy percent of the federal budget is Medicare Medicaid and Social Security not Seventy percent it's about fifty percent if you add\nOn an interest on the national debt and a bunch of other social programs then it gets up to Seventy percent but still the the point is that there is room for cutting the federal deficit we have the highlighted some of the programs some of the stupid spending that has really crippled our country\nNow that does not include however spending to get a new ambassador to Saudi Arabia this is something that President Trump could look into a do I believe that President Trump is to blame for the killing of ... of course not\nAnd this is a ridiculous ... liberal\nBasically incantation and if they say it or not they said enough it might be true and now it's not true do I think President Trump is doing a great job on Saudi Arabia not so much but it's going to be okay it's going to be OK if he keeps in mind certain facts and priorities about our relationship\nWith this desert kingdom out by the way that desert kingdom for those in light and played tonic wonderful blend no this is a brutal and corrupt autocracies so how do you deal with it will get to that and your calls coming up on the ... that show [noise]\nNobody ever and nor should people talk about cutting back what's already pledged in Social Security\nBut it's considered a cut if you cut the rate of increase but you're entirely correct I think what President Trump has in mind here is each of the federal departments is a lot of a set amount of money and not say you have a a government bureau department\nIs is a has a budget of a hundred billion dollars well that budget cut would mean you find five billion dollars to save but you're you're right to bring this up to and thanks for the call\nLet's go to I'm Mark in Columbus ohio mark you're on the Michael ...\nThank you sir I really appreciate your ah your by pirates in a region across the aisle you or your ah your regular view of America really appreciate that thank you [noise]\nUm yeah when you say a President Trump should lead by example he really are [noise] ah I mean what you said yourself [noise] ah he he's already left opposition was open on the field as a\nAs a from people would say and and ... them alone I think she she uh I mean the numbers are incredible it's something like um uh the previous administration had a hundred and twenty five and blow away they want if I\nWas going to bring a point up the your ear entirely on the right track\nI'm Michelle Obama had a staff of sixteen to twenty four people depending on when in her eight years as first lady Lonnie has a staff of nine but you don't want ... Milan you could make do with a staff of seven [laughter] don't you think\nAnd ... and and seriously because this whole thing about getting first ladies big staff\nIs is relatively new and uh and the point is you're right Trump has left a bunch of White House positions unfilled and good for him\nBut I'm ... the whole idea when people talk about turmoil in the White House\nThere would be less turmoil if there were less people working there fewer people working there and I I think that's very very clear I Am I wrote a book about this a long time ago it was at the time that it came out which was a very long time I was forty years ago\nThe time it came out as thirty nine that time that shadow presidents came out it was the first comprehensive history of the White House staff up to that time and it's shocking a President Lincoln won the civil war\nWith the White House staff of two [noise] that's right too it was him and to assistance because he had a cabinet as well not not saying that presidents should try to deal with the White House staff is too but he could probably make do with the White House staff of two hundred and we'll be right back [noise]\nMichael ...

President Trump is blamed for lots of things and [noise]\nThe the media or for instance I Can't believe I made the front page of the New York times with everything else we have going on\nAnd budget deficits and foreign policy crises and the midterm election coming up or do they focus on the fact that the President Trump used the term or space to refer to Stormy Daniels do I think he shouldn't have done that and I shouldn't have done you shouldn't have tweeted about Stormy Daniels she's not worth it why bother\nBut the idea that this is somehow associated with Trump is ridiculous what President Trump has done since he's been president has been to encourage exactly the kind of change in Saudi Arabia that we have known that we've needed for a long time and you know who have knowledge is is\nIt's a Tom Friedman doubled Pulitzer Prize winner in the New York times big liberal but she at least as honest enough\nTo recognize that all of a sudden saying oh we have to blow up our relationship with Saudi Arabia and who cares about their oil he's right the biggest thing is in their oil the biggest thing is Saudi Arabia's role in reforming\nIslam because one harvest Islam\nWhich used to emanates from Saudi Arabia was precisely the kind of danger that led to the worst thing that's happened in most of our memories which has nine eleven and right now say what you want about him\nMohammed bin Salman NBS has been working to rein that in and to change it let me read you some of what a Friedman rights today in the New York times he says I had to find\nOur most important national interest in Saudi Arabia since nine eleven and it's not an oil is not arms sales is not standing up to Iran Islamic religious reform which when come only from Saudi Arabia the home of Islam holy cities making Medina\nI Believe nine eleven was the worst thing to happen to American my lifetime writes Tom Friedman we've spent thousands of lives and some two trillion trying to defuse the threat of Muslim extremists from ... to ISIS dollars that could have gone to many other needs in our society\nAnd I believe the roots of nine eleven came from too terrible bargains one was that bargain between the Saudi ruling family\nAnd the kingdom's religious establishment where each bless the other the other was America's cynical bargain with the Saudis which went like this guy's just keep your oil pumps open your\nPrices low and don't bother the Israelis too much and you can do whatever you want out back preach whatever hate you want in your mosque print whatever conspiracy theories you want in your papers and treat your women however you want\nAnd he said so what\nCaught my eye most about Mohammed bin Salman and made me most hopeful was this tentative willingness to engage in a war of ideas with his religious hardliners declaring publicly do not right that we are re interpreting Islam we're restoring Islam to its origins\nMohammed bin Salman was the guy who saw to it that women can suddenly are allowed to drive\nIn Saudi Arabia that's a a big ... big deal he um\nHe also has argued publicly that Islam and its origins was tolerant of others face and are empowering of women and open the new ideas\nAnd the whole idea that somehow whatever follows Mohammed bin Salman is going to be better\nI think it's foolish and yes there has to be a strong response and this has to be condemned and they're going to have to be people who are punished for this this was a gross crime but the idea that somehow you're going to create instability in Saudi Arabia the cost would\nBe terrible not only in terms of our foreign policy and our confrontation with Iran but in terms of this entire need that Friedman is right to point to which is the need to reform\nIslam's most destructive tendencies oh let's go quickly to Jason in Honolulu you're on the Michael Mann that show hey Jason\nHi thanks for taking the call I'm\nGoing to forget about the economics and and

that\nOr let us go to your calls to Andy uh in Philadelphia Andy you're on the Michael ... show with your fellow Philadelphian Camille polio\nMichael great show as always an absolutely fantastic but I don't agree with much but I really enjoy the conversation which we are in a darker beer from Canada\n... was a real poly or a or being on your obviously and\nOr or any conservative or Libertarian Party leaders that you admire today or follow and secondly do you feel in the Democratic party that you are somewhat alienated nowhere to go on like boy do they serve a libertarian Republican party\nWell let me just say that my my problems with the was it was Democrats um political correctness uh I I I Would express those of warnings about the direction of the party in my column on salon for for many many years and I've included\nThat material in the new book and provocations to show how how it had yeah how many warning signals to work\nOut how the Democratic party wasn't running running off the road long ago ... ... ... people only people who have been ignoring the problems within the party could have been surprised\nBy Trump's when I I certainly was not surprised I I knew in these problems are building and then um your your other question is about a libertarian thought leaders well you mentioned but\nA a a film that's a pretty interesting documentary is from the next to Susan [noise]\nWe'll ask the national why it is that his new film which is now available for streaming which you can find out about by the way if you want to answer this riddle for yourself\nOr you can uh go directly to a death of a nation movie dot com\nBut why is it that film was selected by met a critic and a an article in business insider they listed the Seventy five worst films of all time my brother Harry and I did a book called the fifty words films of all time that was when Harry was a teenager and I was almost a teenager but anyway\nUh his movie destination worst film of all time\nWhy will ask ... coming up on the Michael ... show there's also a great focus right now on the issue of civility a President Trump\nActually was asked in one of the many interviews he's been doing recently and usually was answers are very controversial this I don't think is particularly controversial\nHe was asked about restoring civility in our politics of this is what the president said\nI really think the economy is going to bring people together because people are doing better now African American unemployment the best ever\nAsian American Hispanic American women everything every category I mean whether you look at median income whether you look at employment or unemployment no matter what you're looking at it's either ever for fifty or sixty years the best the best numbers probably the best economy we've ever had\nOkay I'm not sure that's true but I I Do share his hope that with more opportunity and with Americans being able to to concentrate on the great stuff of life and I think politics is pretty grading pretty diverting is very important\nBut really the the main things in life\nAre are things outside of politics and yes they include having a job and getting ahead and making progress for yourself and your family\nAnd uh that was also a subject in the debate last night big debate between a Beto O'Rourke the Democratic challenger and Ted Cruz\nI think the overall and clear winner of the debate and I certainly hope the winner of the Senate election down in Texas now given the fact that Ted Cruz in most polls is nine ten or more points a head\nAnd he really does look like he's got this one locked up why why isn't\nThat mainstream media\nAre are focusing so much attention on this particular challenge there is a secret we will get to that coming up on the ... show I mentioned earlier in the show\nThe comment by ... want commenting on the the untimely death of Paul Allen who is a great and wonderful philanthropist\nAnd uh yes he he and by the way he was not a political conservative though he was against confess get tore taxes and they believe in the free enterprise system and as the wall Street Journal pointed out his great entrepreneur restarted lots of companies and he was a great sports zone or two and a great\nUm creator of museums some of which are pretty darn interesting and wonderful in any event after some one member of the Seattle's city council I'm Joel\nConley at the Seattle PI as a good colony says she uses her seat of city hall is a platform and Seattle's city council member shallow waters lately used it to disparage the lives of the newly deceased the first target was former first lady Barbara Bush\nThe second target was Arizona Senator John McCain\nWonderful the third is micro soft cofounder and Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen\nOn our Facebook page today someone wrote quote Paul Allen was known as a philanthropist that is true she goes on he spend two hundred and fifty million dollars on one of the biggest yacht in the world she says yacht singular\nIn two thousand and three you also on to more you off at a fleet of private jets several sports teams he paid to put\nTo west now century length field on the ballot so that working people picked up most of the four hundred twenty five million dollar tab he spent half a million dollars to defeat I ten Ninety eight tax the rich statewide initiative in two thousand ten\nOkay\nIs one the left us I I mean attacking people after they die and especially not acknowledging the two billion dollars he gave away to fight things like Bolan age\nIt's like the same kind of spirit you heard when Ted Cruz was at an airport yesterday and uh somebody recognized him he's very recognizable and or\nListen to what the senators sounds like versus the people who are going after him\nFor women\n[laughter] I I Believe in due process\nFor a\nMan\nThank you for expressing your First Amendment\nGot like [noise]\nOkay this is hateful and pathetic you want to defend that\nGive me a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six this is why so many people are turning away from the Democratic party this is why there I I now believe the

the aftermath of separate attacks against Republican candidate\nShe said she has been subjected to numerous death threats during her tenure as state party leader and the death threats are no laughing matter\n... overt hatred and violence that has become prevalent for many Democrats or Republicans in recent times is unlawful is unacceptable and it's downright scary okay here's what happened\nMinnesota state representative Sarah Anderson young woman was punched in the arm\nAfter she saw a man who was destroying Republican yard signs she said the attack left her scared and her attacker only existed when she fled to her car and threw it in reverse quota was just insane he was charging at me saying why don't you go kill yourself\nAt us and told the Washington Free beacon have

Vietnam seen Democrats condemned the attack against them but was floored to see the party take such a light approach to Dave's those comments he's the one who wants to take Republicans the guillotine\nHe's a political staffer so you think if anybody should no boundaries I think that it'd be it does exactly what insights people that are kind of violence he said it's while you ask somebody goes actually on Sunday\nJust because we have different political beliefs [noise] I I think there is an illness here and yes it's more common with less than than with the right at the moment a meanwhile why all this attention on cruise versus base hope will play you some highlights and ... they're\nReally interesting to hear you talk about a particle circus after six years and in the U.S

loving\nThe praying wars that his entered this country into is hurting no state war then it's hurting Texas or farmers or ranchers are producers are manufacturers that are exporters right here in San Antonio at the Toyota plant or a million I bought our tundra and met the folks who made it\nYes we have problems with other countries around the world China dumping aluminum and steel manipulating their currency don't want to make sure that we found up to China\nBut whenever we ever gone to war including a trade war without any ... and that's exactly what the president was er cruises help would have us do we've alienated the European Union we've alienated Canada and Mexico we're alienated all other potential partners and we're going it alone against China and it is not working\nJust listen to the farmers and I know you haven't had the chance to to visit every county but I have\nAnd I've listened to them and they are hoarding and the anxiety and the uncertainty of not knowing when these

to Texas to bar ... we grow what we raise what we export and when we what we manufacture\nOkay it all sounds good except it's a complete lie and we're not doing this alone one of the biggest achievements that President Trump already obtained was he did replace NAFTA he said he would he did we're not going it alone we have a trade deal and it's a better trade deal with Canada with Mexico thank you President Trump\nWe also have a better trade deal with South Korea remember at one point there was talk about that\nI'm Ted Cruz a [noise] it it this is actually very sad\nThe uh Ted Cruz
