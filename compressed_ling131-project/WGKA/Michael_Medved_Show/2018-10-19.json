of communicating and if the president United States does it through Twitter every day\nI Will be talking a little bit about the new TV series God friended me are coming up with one of the producers we will also be speaking\nAbout I'm a potential presidential matchup that a lot of people are excited about would be a Nikki Haley on the Republican side versus Beto\nO'Rourke on the Democratic side more Beto O'Rourke I mean the the media love affair\nWith this guy is something to behold\nDoes he deserve all the hype and then we're going to be speaking to Stephen Moore the author of a new book called Trump's ... about some of the lives about the economy\nAnd what happens next after the November elections to help Trump fulfill his America First vision of economic reform one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number but first up\nLast night the president gave a a a rally speech and he was an\nExtraordinarily good spirits you seemed extremely jolly\nThe one aspect of his speech that has gotten all the attention I don't need to play for you because it's in in a CNN and CBS and NBC or all over it and let me just acknowledge\nI think it was unfortunate I don't think it was a good thing that the president said that it was a praise worthy or a vet that basically congressman Gianforte Greg Gianforte of Montana he was in Montana he was in Missoula\nAnd congressman Gianforte and at the time I thought that Gianforte handle it very well he lost his temper he body slammed reporter he knocked off his glasses there were charges brought against him he pleaded guilty he apologized lavishly he made a legal settlement with the reporter heat assaulted\nAnd I've spoken to Congressman John forte this was one of the most embarrassing moments with his wife\nAnd I don't think it's a a good idea for President Trump to make light of it I don't mean cars when John forte would think that however what struck me about this is this is that that was a tiny segment of a very long and very substantive speech actually with Trump was doing and I think in a fairly effective way\nWas laying out\nThe way he's going to be campaigning and very close Senate races in very close governor's races as a Republican trying to help other Republicans and Trump last night was in Montana where the Senate races become unexpectedly close\nBetween our candidate Rosendale and the incumbent Democrat Jon Tester who pretends because he wants lost a finger in a farming accident\nNo there's no solidarity there was to show that you were talking about it because he was lost a finger at a farming accident he's really a moderate Democrat he's a a good old boy that he's not he's a big liberal\nAnd a Trump was speaking on behalf of Matt Rosendale another Montana Republican and he had this to say and defining what this election should be about\n[noise] I Know a lot [noise]\nLaw and order\nAnd common sense that's what it's going to be\nOf those those\nOkay and he's talking about the cabin on the caravan\nAnd common sense and I think he threw in off off script the idea of law and order but that have to find a look in terms of Kavanaugh obviously because of the treatment of a justice Kavanaugh\nThat has mobilized lots of Republicans and there are lots of congressional races they are now the official people who do the polling and the banning and things like that see there is a one out of three chance that Republicans hold the house\nIt used to be down to one out of six\nSo right now Republican prospects there surging\nEven in the house of representatives and that's a good thing and part of it is because yes with their response to justice Kavanaugh the Democrats show that they're not the party of jobs they're the party of well we'll let the president delivers on line\nBut the choice would not be more clear Democrats ... Republicans ... there's jobs [noise]\n\nMan see for\nDemocrats they want to raise your taxes they want to impose socialism on our incredible nation they get Venezuela because that's what's going to have [noise]\nTo take away your health care because you won't be able to have in our country will be able to afford it [noise] destroy your second\nAnd throw open your book\nDeadly drugs and vicious gangs because plenty of them are coming across a lot of drugs\nOkay and this is a problem for President Trump because guess what he's president United States Republicans control the Senate and the house they rolled apartment homeland security they control lights and he is right that there are a lot of people coming across the border I just looked at the numbers and their set\nOf the number of people entering the country illegally has not gone down and went down the first year of Trump's presidency or the first part of the first year of Trump's presidency\nSound like tripled where it was when Trump became president of the rates in September ... angry and that's why I think President Trump is absolutely right to make an issue of this caravan and by the way the evidence appears to be as of a half hour ago\nThat there was some progress getting Mexican authorities to move troops to try to block the advance of of what looks to be over four thousand people waving Honduran flags by the way\nWho were marching their way through Guatemala and then through Mexico and they say they're headed to the United states what Democrats say we know where Trump's stance from stands on a common sense principle which I honestly who who couldn't disagree you cannot let\nThis caravan in you can feel sorry for these people\nBut if we go ahead and say oh well you march told his way will come and we'll process your your applications for asylum this there will be no end to it\nIt will encourage more and more and more and more and\nLook it's it's a question here not of whether we rearrange our immigration system to make it more sensible maybe even more compassionate\nBut right now the question was this caravan is whether we have an immigration system at all\nOr whether we simply raise the borders any kind of meaningful distinction and uh I think\nFrankly President Trump is looking at this thing going on how is this going to work out either as she is going to win victory and turn the caravan back\nWhere there's going to be some kind of awful disaster and I think the incoming president of Mexico Andres Lopez Manuel Obrador um has a ... actually shown some willingness to work with the Trump Administration on stopping\nThis caravan which is crucial I've been a from a\nSaid this about the economy and related it of course of the fact that there are more and more people coming across the border\nBecause such an incredible autonomy I have so many [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay uh probably the rhetoric I created so much I've done this I was and\nYou know and that's not ideal rhetoric but look the fact is the economy has done better that's what we're going to be talking about was even more coming up and in just a moment\nThe point over here and I think it's very striking is everybody knows what Trump says everybody knows where Trump stands everybody knows what Trump has to say about this has anyone heard a any kind of meaningful democratic response on this issue of the caravan\n'cause I've heard nothing all they do is they attacked Trump and that's not a policy being anti Trump is not a policy and last night\nThey don't work the new democratic superstar the great hope for Democrats not just for two thousand Eighteen but for two thousand and twenty and beyond ... who's a talented politician but he blew up his his own campaign and frankly I think his own future\nWith a one answer that was just a polling we'll get to that and us to your calls coming up we'll also be speaking with Stephen Moore\nThe author of a new book Trump ... of course one of the leading economic thinkers at the Heritage Foundation behind the America First economic reform we'll be right back [noise]\nOne eight hundred nine five five\nAbsolutely right yeah yeah and we we are absolutely agree on that let me let me go back to to one thing that the Democrats have been lying about and they literally lie about this every day and the media never call them on it\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design that those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues and it's just a flat on line is that\nYeah that revenues are actually up this year so we passed the biggest tax cut and three years and we actually have a slight increase rep is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nUh continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues headed for people to work at ... businesses profitable businesses back to the United states which has happening\nUh but yeah the problem is spending and you know people say oh you're just a robbery Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans and Democrats this bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for this\nAnd you like a President Trump's a idea\nVast amount every department to cut five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's what businesses do\nYou know that that's the thing if you're running a business\nAnd you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agents and this is what businesses did during the recession they talked in their stomach\nThey tighten their belts they got rid of an efficient workers and an efficient services and things they didn't need and they save money they became profitable getting we never do that in government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nOf your show Paul endear show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it will exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ... the one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked out in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement\nA where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories and\nAnd warehouses and and apartments and\nThat that is a structure we need pipelines we need a lot of Alan gee terminals we need oil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our ports\nA lot of that Michael I think can be good to be done with private money it doesn't why what where does it say that the government has to pay for all of this stuff\nAnd I think that's a great ... points for President Trump to borrow from the book from ... from my friend and guess Stephen Moore he is a a chief economist at the Heritage Foundation of the book is posted up at our website\nAt Michael ... dot com [noise] uh when we come back or I Want to talk a little bit about the uh bay do blow up and it is a blow up that major major major stumble by the golden boy

something she clearly has emerged from the Trump Administration with a greatly enhanced reputation and resume\nAnd uh she is the one Republican that pretty much everybody seems to admire in like she spoke last night of the Al Smith dinner that's in New York City it's a time when this time of year\nA presidential candidates often speak there you can show your humor a President Trump has spoken their Hillary has spoken there a John McCain did a killer routine the Al Smith dinner\nNikki Haley speaking there looking beautiful by the way she was very bland out and and she can do am I allowed to say that did I say something terrible is going to get me in\n... I don't I don't think it's probably too late to dump it but no I'm Sorry Nikki Haley look as a sensational and very glamorous said was I'm\nOf a bare shoulders as great anyway she sounded like this\nEveryone in Washington called\nMe with advice about this age they all said the same thing I Do not under any circumstances make any jokes about the president [noise]\nSo good night everybody [laughter] actually the president called me this morning and gave me some really good advice\nOr ... who's a member of the house of representatives forty six years old he he could just dodge the whole thing even if he loses and the Senate he's not giving away he's collected so much money over sixty million total just thirty eight million in the last quarter\nHe's broken all kinds of records were fundraising because people are very very inspired by his rhetoric last night he had a tough night very good at answering questions but there was one question he was asked where the answer's gonna come back and bite him here's the question\nMy question would be a what would you say to Republicans and independents who are watching tonight and are contemplating about voting for you but are worried that should you when your main objective as senator would be to try and impeach President Trump\nOK tough question right because well\nLet's listen to the way that uh the young Mr O'Rourke a dodges and waves and refuses to face it here's this direct answer\nOn until everyone in this state regardless of your party affiliation or any other small difference that does not have to define us at this moment that we can come together I Want to represent all of you it's why I'm here in the Rio Grande valley one last reliably democratic places in the state if not the country\nUm we can bank on your boat take for granted but I keep coming back to communities like ... on because I Want to hear your story one incorporated\nInto our campaign it's the same reason that I go\nTo this question amount in ... by the way he ramble on and on like this for literally about five minutes which out even touching the subject of impeachment\nAnd Dana Bash is moderating for CNN which loves bet though says wait a minute listen\nKind of thing [noise] fly fishing was out and use\nThat in July that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach heavy changed your mind\nBy having 'em\nLet let me let me put it this way I'm there may be an open question as to whether the president than the candidate sought to ... with the Russian government in two thousand and fixing to quote George Will very conservative columnist when we saw him on that stage in Helsinki\nDefending ... in the head of the country that attacked our democracy and twenty sixteen instead of this country and its citizens and it's amazing democracy was collusion inaction\nThere may have wondered when he fired James Comey the principal investigator and what happened in that election whether that was an attempt to obstruct justice but win by broad daylight on Twitter\nHe asked his attorney general Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation I Would say that's obstruction inaction\nOkay goes on and basically what he's saying is yes he would go back to the house of representatives if he if he does go back to the house of representatives a I'd be not planning on and he's planning to be elected Senate that won't happen or anything he favors impeachment\nAnd I think that's political poison I I think it it means that any moderates who was thinking of voting for Beto O'Rourke because Ted Cruz is very conservative\nOr forget it I ... honestly it at people out there are things that a veteran workers answering this question of actively look people who love the idea of impeachment they're going to vote for him anyway\nBut why what is wrong congressman O'Rourke from giving an honest answer and saying look\nWe just want to find out the facts let the investigation work right now there is no evidence and there is none that should lead to charges of high crimes and misdemeanors and impeachment but let the investigation work next question\nInstead he goes out and lays out a case for impeachment now it's foolish let's go quickly to Ned ... just a Georgia you're on the Michael ...\nMichael Trump's praise of Greg Gianforte body slam was far more than unfortunate it was outrageous

political differences here at home\nThey're just our opponents [noise] we're blessed with a political system that allows us to resolve our differences peacefully in the end we must recognize that we are all Americans and we are stronger and healthier when we are United\nOkay I think it's tough to disagree with that and particularly in the context of what I began by talking about which is the case of a Christian Woman whose name as a C a bb she's illiterate but then a lot of people in Pakistan are particularly women\nAnd by the way that's not an anti woman comment that's a pro woman comment I mean one of the things that is deeply dysfunctional about a lot of the Islamic countries in the world is that ah they don't provide any education for the women\nIn any event she's Christian and uh\nShe has been on death row in two thousand ten what is there a crime well here's the other way it's described in the wall Street Journal\nUm it it it turns out that are troubles began and again this is eight years ago with a squabble over a couple of water on a sweltering summer day in Punjab\nTo Muslim women accused ms baby a farm worker and a a mother\nA mother of five in fact they accused her of polluting the cop that they were all drinking from on this hot day bigger she drank from it and she's not a Muslim So in the midst of this argument\nAllegedly ms baby told them Jesus died on the cross for the sins of mankind what did your prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind\nNow it's not even clear she actually said that because under Pakistani law\nTo talk about blasphemy is blanche than me so all you're allowed to do is say she committed blasphemy you're not allowed to cross examine the witnesses she's been condemned to death since two thousand ten she lives in a windowless cell\nThere have been international efforts to free her\nAnd um [noise]\nIt's it's just unbelievable they're already people who have died in her case a shortly after the span villagers accused ms Bebe of blasphemy and they had or imprison\nThe following year record censored to death she lives in a windowless cells where she cooks for herself for fear of poisoning by prison staff or a fellow inmates against this backdrop of standing up for his baby requires courage in Pakistan and two thousand Eleven's a year after she was condemned\nThe governor of Punjab governor Solomon tests here I've visited her in prison to try to show some sympathy for her\nAnd right after that visit and his expression\nOf support for us see a bb his bodyguard killed him\nTwo months later a gunman killed Shabaab bought see that's another a Christian politician who also opposed Pakistan's blasphemy law\nIt's an unbelievable thing this is a nuclear power now why am I talking about this right now not only because there is attention to her case and there's a new president of Pakistan Imran Khan who says he's a reformer he's a former cricket star\nAnd maybe just maybe he will so some mercy on this poor woman the problem is the president con\nUh supports the blasphemy law the idea that someone should be executed for saying something that disagrees with the religious beliefs of Ninety seven percent of Pakistanis\nOr the entire thing is mad and it's difficult and it brings us to this um this is your mom to show the incident I uh I had been troubled by some voices on the right who want to say that to show the at one time\nAnd his wife had been sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly moved away from that if you read his last column that he wrote before he died that was just published earlier this week in the Washington Post he was no Islamist he he was calling on Islamic countries to allow more press freedom ironically\nThe the idea that anyone would try to justify or minimize the hideous nature of what apparently was done to Mr show he has said I actually think President Trump and secretary palm pay on particular have been getting it about right\nYou can't go off and say well we support other reforms that Mohammed bin Salman is doing therefore this is okay we have to look past it\nBut you also can say we're going to blow up our entire relationship with Saudi Arabia which is a regional power and as a very important ally the United states over this one episode\nAnd it's it's a remarkably important that we move forward we will form of some unity and not make this into a political issue one of the things that the Democrats do wrong as they want to make every last thing about Trump and or\nDo I think that from made a mistake or comparing well saying that they he should be innocent until proven guilty it's like Brett Kavanaugh comparing\nThe potential murder to the uh legit at I Believe imagined a song by a Seventeen year old high school guy who ... and and the ... and it was all that the Coleman aided in groping\nUp to compare that to a brutal murder and dismembered meant and torturing a guy in cutting off his fingers and and then slicing of his body to transport out of the country [noise] this is not comparable\nAnd it's also not comparable because this was done in the name of government I'll tell you what scares me most about the show the story\nIs that stupidity if sometimes more frightening than arrogance or pure evil and how stupid do have to be if you're planning to murder some journalists to try to do it in the consulate in a foreign power\nWhat do you think is going to happen\nHow can you imagine you're not going to get caught maybe they wanted to get off they wanted to send a message but that's evil to send a message through murder and torture is hideous and it's evil and that's wrong\nThese stories the one from ... which is hideous the one from Saudi Arabia and or the murder if it occurred and I think it did is actually from turkey they're very alarming but they have one\nLesson is profoundly important the lesson is\nProtect religious liberty get is absolutely crucial or we will get to that and some of the fight for

man's eyes guy and a\nAnd you know no man's sized Kleenex or for OK well known men's eyes clinics anymore for anybody I'm Kimberley Clark the parent company Kleenex said it received a consistent increase of complains about the branding for manned size clinics\nKleenex men's eyes to shows have been on shelves for the past six years at a statement the company over that time the brand has always been characterized by a much larger tissue size which is both sauce and strong the companies and their statement\nKimberly Clark and no way suggested being both soft and strong isn't exclusively

large\nDo I believe that this is a tragedy know do I think that this is a raid on our cultural patrimony no\nBut it's a silly and stupid and pathetic and strange to think of a company wasting serious

column anymore\nThe original dear Abby now on the call has been taken over by genes Philips who is the daughter of the original dear Abby but she was asked a question about a very complicated elaborate foreign sounding name\nThat someone was considering giving a child and dear Abby said this\nNot only can foreign names be difficult to pronounce and spell but they can also call a trial calls a child to be teased on mercifully\nSometimes the name can be a problematic word in the English language and one that sounds beautiful and a foreign language can be grading English by the way when I read that I immediately thought\nOf of a problem that some Israeli Americans have\nA very common popular a Hebrew name Israeli name is Laura and uh or moron I mean but seriously you don't want to name your daughter or your son moron and not not in in this country and not in this culture they\nProbably better named to choose now the point about this year everything is all hell has broken lose for dear Abby\nPeople have claimed that she is affirming white privilege that there is a racial thing and there's no racial and what she said but of course the New York times is ready to make\nIt racial they have a column that says I'm the heated reaction to the column which has been a staple in American households for decades\nAnd was started by Mr Philips mother use a pen name Abigail Van Buren the seed reaction has inspired a fresh debate about identity acceptance and racism\nAbby's column was deeply infuriating and also revel at Torrey said a a a woman named uh Valerie cower\nAbby is clean to an old America were white is considered the norm and everything else deviant and inferior\nMusk our added that she and her partner believed it was more important to honor a child's heritage and connect them to then heritage then for a name to be easy to pronounce\nOkay fine Abby was not suggesting that anyone is just giving advice do I think it's reasonable advice sure do we have very very dear friends who have given other children very difficult names we do absolutely and you get used to it\nUh and now I'm not talking about you Greg a though Gregg is laughing here can I mention the names of your children okay they named their kids after inanimate objects penny a river\nAnd Jonas but none of those names or that hard to spell or though I don't know may be probably people there are probably people's bell penny wrong\nBut not many uh okay the point about the point about this it just seems to me is why is everything about race well because people make it about race they a quote someone named a non\n... he's a writer who writes about socialism and about the evils of capitalism he says is the reality that a lot of this has to do with names\nBut more with white and is there a lot of complicated names from polish and Russian and Italian and German background that have become second nature to Americans\nThe unusual names referred to in the dear Abby column aren't unique in their complexity he said they're unique in their complex and they tend to come from places where people aren't\nWhite that is nonsense I I mean I I think it's very difficult if uh if somebody they're all kinds of names which could understand would be would be difficult and challenging and by the way my last name\nIs difficult and challenging my father's older brother\nMy uncle ... uh uh his his name was motion method and he changed his name to\nMore stuff and that was the way he did business 'cause it was easier for business a dove Hebrew or the Hebrew word for bear is dog and the Russian word for bears ms it yet so okay\nThis seems to me inane but then we have we have this and this is a piece in the Washington Post\nAs sexual assault survivors continue to share their

don't think that would happen that little girl now that that comes from politicians that politicians are\nCurrently eagle gods now you don't have the gods now\nYou know God's Nell as evil but does now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look at him the the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things have politicians do sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision\nWhere the Washington state Supreme Court\nAh basically said that uh they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who have committed murder before the age of Eighteen knows the life imprisonment that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults but for people convicted of murder\nAs adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen you can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this then I think it's profoundly wrong but see we we lose the battle to him if we lose the language and evil loses all of its meaning\nIf you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters\nAnd equating her with a these people in Pakistan who were\nLiterally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that the Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nI'm OK you could argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and are threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians what a defender\nThat it seems to me is a very different matter\nAnd this is also one of the problems that the people had an and there were people\nOf this nature a stolen was evil Hitler was evil so why is it that we sent millions of dollars billions of
