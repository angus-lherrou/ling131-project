first order of business will\nBe a full investigation and impeachment of\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh good idea you look forward to that of course they also want to investigate President Trump or on the grounds of impeachment has been going on for a while look if you voted democratic in these upcoming elections\nYou're voting for this insanity to continue\nWhy is it good for the country what do you hope to accomplish when I'm Brett Kavanaugh on Saturday was officially confirmed by a vote in the U.S Senate of fifty to forty eight\nIt actually would have been fifty one to forty nine except senator Steve Danes of a North Dakota\nWanted to participate in his daughter's wedding and look as somebody who last may participated in my own daughter's wedding our own daughter's wedding I understand how the senator felt and Senator Murkowski who voted wrong on Kavanaugh in my opinion\nI was very gracious and saying look she will keep it so that it will be shown that I'm Brett Kavanaugh actually passed with a to vote margin\nThe final vote would have been fifty one forty nine as it was it was fifty to forty eight because she just voted present alright fine I'm this is what it sounded like

will restore order and the gallery [noise]\nOkay um\nWhat what is it that the folks are screaming about and what are they aiming to achieve what's fascinating to me about this is remember that dramatic Thursday it seems like another era where you had testimony from a doctor Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd then you hadn't testimony from Brett Kavanaugh\nVery very high profile everyone was watching on TV a lot of interruptions from demonstrators\nNo I don't think there were any there weren't whether Germany nobody nobody know that now somehow they were able for that\nTo control these idiots and I'm Sorry I think people who are screaming about murder and things like that or are idiots indeed\nHonestly if they can control it in a high profile situation they shooting ... every day\nThis is like a banana republic it is not appropriate for the world's greatest constitutional republic that people should be able to come on and into the galleries and screaming shout and by the way one of the things that has to happen is really prosecuting these people\nAnd I'm making them feel that disrupting congressman doing its job and by the way\nI Would include all of the conservative demonstrators who do that kind of thing as well why do I say that because there are not I mean this is not some conservatives do what can you think of the last time\nThat some right winger interrupted a the proceedings of a Senate committee or the Senate in session making an important decision like confirming a Supreme Court justice of the Huffington Post\nPut together a collage of some of the

of that that footage just wonderful to watch and I I Need to describe it to\nA group of demonstrators came up to the doors of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court building in the United states in Washington DC it's a wonderful building and that Greek temples style all based upon the parcel out on an Athens and classics because again the founders of our country\nIdentified with the creators of Greek and Roman law they did I Know more white males though again there are people and African studies departments who claim the ancient Greeks were really not white but leave that aside um\nMeanwhile these folks came up to the doors of the Supreme Court building and the doors are those heavy metal doors that with carvings on them and big handles\nAnd so a group of demonstrators came up to the doors Supreme Court building banging on them literally budding their heads against them screaming shouting and sounding like this\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nWhat is the [noise] what is the the clear message here that we're supposed to be getting I Will tell you I think there's a clear message is overwhelming with clear\nIf you think this stuff is good for our country and then of course you want to vote democratic coming up a month from now you you do\nBecause the Democrats will guarantee much much much much more of this with impeachment investigations and lots of investigations and lots of hysteria and the end of the republic as we know it uh and basically some of the Democrats on the Senate floor wait to hear Cory Booker Spartacus\nOr who really has jumped the shark I mean it's it's just if this is your hysteria\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh you think he's talking about ... you think he's talking about a a heaving analogize the ah the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nWith people getting their heads bashed in we're has there been some cruelty or some assault on the individuals who are expressing their opposition to Brett Kavanaugh I I mean what are we talking about here\nWhy is this appropriate they they of course had a song or what would be a liberal occasion unless I actually go to the one of the protest from Saturday immediately after the vote it sounded like this [noise]\n[noise]\nThat's right [noise] do not take the de la [noise]\nJust expressed outrage and\nThis may I think it's a sad day for our country\nOkay it is a sad day\nFor our country [noise] when you don't have both parties I'm hauling enough on that [noise] I mean honestly why would anyone vote democratic [noise]\nUnless you want this stuff to continue and if you do tell me why one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nThere's another piece about the courts legitimacy crisis analyzing the votes behind the senators who voted to confirm justice Kavanaugh will get

sexual assault ... gotten it wasn't the use of anything\nSo I Know and that's exactly the point ... wait wait and that's exactly the point that there was he wasn't accused of anything\nHe wasn't called the radical he wasn't he wasn't cold heartless Merrick Garland a basically they postponed I'm considering his appointment because of when it was announced and but there was no attempt to smear him in any way and nor do I know of any basis to smear him but go ahead\nAnd nothing about the fact of the matter is actually the woman who actually a few sexual a felt\nNo no there were not it was only I'm Sorry and this is very important that um\nThere was nothing injustice Kavanaugh's record nothing involving sexual harassment sexual assault sexual charges misbehavior there were no ex wives there wasn't enough thing\nA clean record until literally after his hearing had concluded\nAnd then they threw a Hail Mary pass and thought they'd make some hay with this one which is totally uncorroborated\nExcuse me you are not there so you can\nI say it is totally on robbery did you write I wasn't there but what what is it that you think should this be the new standard now\nI'll tell you exactly what we should've done okay we should have done it so investigation fairly it's not a reason for us run the rushing a lifetime appointment with all due respect we should have just white ... and do an investigation investigation and then if I actually done this or not\nOkay again again if there was any available evidence to confirm any aspect of Christine Blasey Ford story even the existence of this party the witnesses that she named\nSaid they have no recollection of central party they don't remember it she didn't tell anybody until Thirty years later\nThe the entire thing the whole idea that that well there were charges by within those charges clearly were manufactured in by the way\nThere was an important piece ends of peace not by someone who's on the rights of someone who's on the left [noise] or a writer for the wall Street Journal named after work you know money who identifies herself as somebody who is on the left who was unhappy with the Kavanaugh appointment

Medicare for all spending the United states government literally into oblivion\nAnd it's come on the dishes craziness right now and this is talk about a civil war there were issues and that civil what is the issue here\nWhat is it that that Charles Blow thinks is the key issue and his column that he writes liberals this is war and by the way the next day or actually it was the prior day the liberals this war that this morning\nOn Saturday the time that a big article ... courts legitimacy crisis is by Michael ... and he makes an interesting point\nWhich is that for justice Gorsuch injustice Kavanaugh\nThey're the only two justices in the entire history of the Supreme Court who have been nominated by president who didn't win the popular vote and confirmed by a majority of center senators\nWho when you take all the votes of the people who voted for Gore such an all the votes of the people who voted for\nJustice Kavanaugh and you put them against\nAll of the voters gathered by the people who voted against them well there were more votes for the people who voted against\nOkay but this is craziness because that's not how the way we choose US Senators it's true that Wyoming gets two U.S senators there too fine conservative Republicans so to California\nAnd Wyoming has a population of about six hundred thousand in California has a population of thirty eight million they have the same representation in the U.S Senate that's how you find more votes on the other side\nBut this deliberately is the way they set up a constitution to protect smaller states so that you don't have a situation\nWhere everything in the whole country is irrelevant except for California and Texas and Florida\nAnd New York everything else doesn't count I I mean this is very obvious and yes people\nWho vote in California you have to be counted in the popular vote and they certainly have a big say in the electoral votes\nBecause you've got fifty five electoral votes and but here's here's the basic point his complained is not against the legitimacy of the court his complaint is against the constitutional system that does work\nPretty well for two hundred and forty years\nReally what's wrong with these people were going to challenge the legitimacy of the court not based upon the qualifications of justice Gorsuch or justice Kavanaugh\nBut based on the fact that the senators who voted for the most of whom are Republicans represented states with smaller population than the people who voted against them one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six ... really it's foolishness\nA deep deep foolish enough it seems to me and speaking of the foolishness one of the um\nMost outspoken opponents\nOf the confirmation of justice capital which Spartacus or the one and only Cory Booker\nAnd he was out campaigning in Iowa why was he campaigning in Iowa is it because he is just enormously popular in Iowa does he have a family in Iowa I don't think so I don't know maybe this but why was Cory Booker and I always in Iowa because that's where the Democratic nomination process begins\nAnd his plan to win the presidency is he is going to be the most hysterical\nOr the most over the top the most ridiculous of all of the Democrats speaking no a lot of people that he's trying to follow the path blazed by Brock Obama won the Iowa caucuses that was the beginning of his path to the presidency beat Hillary Clinton the Iowa caucuses\nIs very different bronco Obama went to Iowa trying to show he was more reasonable more unified\nAnd or Cory Booker well Cory Booker\nGoes to Iowa and sounds like this\nLong until November\nKnow\nMore than ... than\nPublic education how\n\nHave with our universe\nAs\nGoes sport I guess\nI I'm Sorry\nCan we listen to that again this is this is one of the most embarrassing political beaches of our time um I I was in it it's an Iowa the Iowa wasn't close this time Trump carried Iowa by nearly ten points it was it was a white an out\nAnd and Cory Booker\nThinks he's going to appeal to Iowa was is can we lose our\nThan\nPlanned Parenthood than public education how\n\nHave with our universe okay\nCorey yeah you should you should meet another year like a ... named Howard Dean I Know I don't know for a went to Oxford Stanford too and uh\nBut seriously at this didn't work out so well for Howard Dean but\nHow long\nOkay and and again he I Korea I Know\nHas a strong Christian background he does he could have ... how long oh lord how long I Would prefer you echo the eyes of a a passage that says come let us reason\nTo Casper against Cory ... you can do better this and then wait same guy Spartacus\nIs on the Senate floor and delivering is final ... and the judge\nKavanaugh on the Senate floor and more inspiring rhetoric from the gentleman from New Jersey\nFor a lot of folk our asking me what\nNow oh\nI Want to conclude by reading some word from another painful period\nPeople didn't know what this body would do [noise] there was injustice in this land people didn't know what this body with two\nHundred\nThousand a hundred thousand thing for tomorrow and to protest to fit in and they didn't know what your body will do through anyway and they fought any way sometimes they were\nBeaten in fact in one case on a bridge with Alabama they were beaten and bloody one of my colleagues and the other chamber John Lewis hadn't had split open but they eventually got\nBridge and Dr Montgomery and a man named king gave his speech to those people who are tempted to surrender to cynicism in that time the fish for those people who wanted to do up to do that I suppose people were hurting this is what he said\nAnd I quote he goes I Know you're asking today how long will it take somebody's asking how long will prejudice blind the visions of men\nDark in their understanding and Dr bright eyed wisdom from her secret flown\nSomebody asking when will wound that justice wind prostrate on the streets lifted okay\nI I if I understand Dr King was right wounded justice was\nProstate or on the streets in Alabama in Nineteen sixty three sixty four sixty five years right [noise] but how is the justice lying bleeding and prostrate on the streets today one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and a surprise from the new justice capital summing up [noise]\nClerks end up having an

west and you're on the Michael ...\nOr you hey\n... what I Want to start with a question okay sure are yes or do you agree that it would be despicable to make a false accusation against the person that would destroy his like of course\nOkay All right for them that were agreed\nThat it's not Cory Booker is not acting crazy he's a despicable person all of these Democrats are despicable people Christine Blasey Ford accusation\nHas been totally proven to be false or or if not in any way demonstrably true she has\nBeen okay is it that's that's a different thing she is ... ... how is she been shy about how she'd been shown to be a liar\nOkay she said she was afraid to fly obviously that's not the case\nWill wait wait wait that was a statement by one of her lawyer she did not say all that she would question her lawyers gave an isolating or how\nThe second door on her house was built because she she felt confined\nAgain this is this is this is a lot I you're right and\nAnd that's not something that she said apparently something she led the put out there and her name I think we make a mistake if we wanted to attack a Dr Ford as some kind of despicable person I think she's\nI think I Do I Do question our credibility I don't think she has been tried and credible and any of this but I I think she may in one level believe it there was actually an argument about this involving a

are talking about the ongoing fallout about\nOne of the a truly great confirmation battles and all of the history of the U.S Senate and in fact I Can't think of anything that has produced a this this level of of negativity and craziness and hatred the board battle was close\nThe Clarence Thomas battle was close\nBut what's interesting about that is there were a bunch of Democrats who voted to confirm Clarence Thomas\nThey weren't\nThere were unfortunately a bunch of Republicans who turned against\nJudge Bork\nAnd ah here it was such a strict party line thing but Susan Collins I think spoke so well for people who may be in there are a bunch of Americans who are genuinely undecided anybody who's still undecided and you don't know well how do they handle it or what is really count on that she lives in Susan's calling speech\nShe made this clear\nI'm OK we will get to that in a moment and she made clear that she believes that Christine Blasey Ford was assaulted\nBut she believes not by I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd this is what Mazie Hirono the gentle lady of Hawaii I actually the most pathetic of of all of the Democrats and the Judiciary Committee this is what senator Hirono had to say about Susan Collins\nMe think that senator Collins is insulting to professor for what to say that the things that back and forth I think that he left us out there what is that in the ... of\nThe herself that that's his or her many survivors are from her state and elsewhere all of us have been very sorry have an across from survivors going back many many years where they kept all these ...\nA a cost to themselves and the says what happens with ... virus that they did not come forward I also know that in your interview that she kept saying that there was no cooperation\nRight um so what what is the point how do they just how much money for sex ed for the ...\n[noise] well it's probably a pilot study 'cause it was only one point four million dollar only now overall every year ha Jeff doled out about four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of grants to put that in perspective\nThe U.S military every year at the department of defense their total budget is six hundred billion dollars wow wow\n... ... it in terms of what you were talking about was open the books dot com you have\nA a basic approach which is the transparency is the only way to solve this is letting people know what's going on and President Trump doesn't have to get this through Congress he could do it on his own right\n[noise] well that's that's the plan of the strategy that we outline first that the wall Street Journal then at USA Today and it's a three pronged attack and as the commander in chief at this moment that our nation's history when we feel that spending is a crisis\nThe president can take this three pronged approach and he should lead by example you should post all White House expenditures and then step to\nCut the federal agency waste and step three and this is my favorite part Michel he should report to the American people\nShow us how he's defending the American taxpayer by cutting waste fraud and taxpayer abuse and we believe that he should do Twitter to do the reporting\nI think it's a great idea and by the way you also suggest year that there should be an across the board cut in every federal department beginning with the White House and this is something I wrote a book about the White House staff years ago\nAnd man is there a lot of waste and ridiculous enough in terms of the Fifteen hundred people who work in the White House staff\nA President Roosevelt one world war two with a hundred and six White House aides total and ... what is it that we need Fifteen times that number for today\nI don't I don't get that at all what what about can you give us some background on the um the two hundred thousand six hundred one dollars that our government spends on a new condom design with a additional lubrication why why does the federal government spend on that\nYou know the condom industry it's a very competitive industry but I'm\nA two hundred thousand dollars floated well Boston, Massachusetts is a private company for a new condom design this is just one of the grants now they're obviously a small company\nWe did identify Michael that the fortune one hundred these are our most successful companies in the entire world\nCertainly in this country but over a three year period they received three point three billion dollars worth of our money American taxpayer subsidies and they cannot argue that they need our money\nUh there's another one here which is a cigar taste test in Virginia for a hundred and fourteen thousand three hundred and Seventy five dollars how could they hold the spending to just a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars for the cigar taste test\n[laughter] and there's a lot of studies like that one point one million dollars of our taxpayer money went to prepare America's religions for the discovery of extraterrestrial life one million dollars went for a study on where it hurts the most to be stunned by be\nOkay ... I guess the theory is that if the government doesn't prepare you for the arrival of Esther extraterrestrials who will then we also spend money looking for extraterrestrial only government my\nWell I think that was an inside deal that was twenty million dollars that the one that went to one of Harry Reid's friends and they went out looking for extraterrestrial life\nOkay people should should get involved with this and what I Love is the three pronged approach which is number one President Trump begin by showing how every penny is spent in the White House and a number two he cuts the White House staff\nBy ten percent and then orders every other federal departments cut by five percent and then number three he starts giving us updates every month on this war on waste because this is a war we can actually win if you want to find out more about this uh go to our website to Michael midday dot com\nWill link you write to open the books dot com that's open the books dot com or\n... is the founder and the c._e._o. and I think you're doing the Lord's work my friend and I hope you continue to have great success with it we will be right back on the Michael ...

we're broadcasting from Seattle where officially this is indigenous people's day and uh I I'm sure we will get complains because we didn't do anything today to honor\nIndigenous peoples actually we did we played we played that protest song which I think is based on the chance of indigenous peoples by some of the crazed demonstrators\nAnd they are crazed who continue to celebrate indigenous

United states of Hollywood of courses offered to particularly\nGracious response to the defeat of the left on on this issue um remember Kathy Griffin\nWho had that whole ... example of carrying a

[laughter] that's so weird Murphy [noise] I don't know how you got in\nHere but it's inappropriate\nReally wanted to talk about what's inappropriate how about the way you do your job\nCame on the role of the White House press secretary\nIs to create transparency and the government and tell the American people the truth but that's not what happens in this room whether it's about a meeting with Russians in Trump Tower or a made up mandate that require separation between parents and their shoulder at the border it all comes down to the same thing so here's my question\nWhy do you live\nI think that's absolutely ridiculous [laughter]\nShe's you know and how do moral lies and use it for us to be called the enemy of the people\nI mean how do we go back to our newspapers and magazines and our networks knowing that the most basic principle of journalistic integrity to report the fact is totally out of reach if we can get to the truth\nWhy are we even here [noise] I say we get up and walk out right now\nLive show administration we're not gonna take it any more or less so [noise]\nI Know the last\n... has this look I\nKnow a lot of what I said you're asked to resonate with you I Know a lot of you\nPersonally [noise]\nSome better than others that's her son's you saw them maybe I don't know you as well as I thought I did [noise] ah\nOkay this is so pathetic I mean even by the standards\nOf a failed sitcom in life with Murphy Brown eyes visible ratings it got one third of the ratings of NBC's re booted will and grace\nIt's got less than one fifth of the re booted Roseanne ratings less than one fifth as as a share of the audience\nBut can you listen to those line readings it's like she doesn't even understand what she's reciting here which I she may be reading from a teleprompter I don't know it's it's pathetic\nAnd it makes me nostalgic my brother Harry and I wrote a book a long time ago way back in Nineteen eighty ah\nAnd my brother and I had a book called the golden turkey wars and we gave out a life achievement award for the worst actress of all time Candice Bergen was a nominee [laughter] she was she didn't win she didn't win but she was nominated and\nFor goodness sake this is supposed to be funny\nWhat would I don't understand is people are saying and actually Meghan McCain was back on the view today and she was actually moving she had taken six weeks off because of her father's death and funeral and in mourning and she talked about\nUh the country coming together and at least being able to talk to each other\nCouldn't Hollywood help with this process well yes but not if you're going to respond to people like Senator Collins\nWith basically the F you not if you're going to go after a former astronaut because he dares to quote Churchill because Churchill is now unacceptable or\nIs this entire thing the\nThe insanity about a civil war\nWhat does that civil war about if you're on the left and you think you need to keep protesting and you need to challenge the service of judge Kavanaugh tell me how you're going to do that one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd he's sitting on the Supreme Court and he's going to sit on that Supreme Court for the next forty years at least so go ahead\nAnd brought her back to the Democrats ... ... what was that if they accept that the girls and the ... the Supreme Court we're at war with her and they said they're going to hurt the grip on power and that's ... ...\nWell no it is it is not war war is saying things like we have to mount armies and stock supplies and live off the land and drive them out\nWhat the Democrats are saying right now is vote vote vote vote vote and fine and good luck I don't think they are very effectively appealing to voters and the reason that this whole idea of a war doesn't hold a Jeff is look John Adams said something very famous\nIn the American revolution he said\nA third of people living in colonies at the time wanted independence a third want to draw a main loyal to Britain than a third one and simply to be left alone\nIf you have a full third who are willing to fight and another full third who are willing to fight on the other side yes you could have a very bloody war and they were twenty five thousand people Americans who died in that war\nBut uh we don't have that the percentage of people on the left who want to go ahead and how people out of restaurants or want to make this a war\nI I think it's it's not anywhere near a third frankly I don't think it's near ten percent it's extreme crazies and they certainly don't deserve to be voted into office let's go to Tom in Glen Dora California Tommy clear on\nYet I very much you bet I'd\nLove to give you a preliminary thirty second shameless flirt\nNano ... thank you
