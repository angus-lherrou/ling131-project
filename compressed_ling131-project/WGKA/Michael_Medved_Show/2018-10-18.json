impact I win one of the things that you're hearing from the left right now is uh oh my goodness the tax cuts and created this soaring federal deficit we do have a deficit is going up too much and going up dangerously\nAnd President Trump addressed that yesterday's asked every federal department to do a five\nPercent cut which should go a long way to at least slowing the growth and the deficit but one of the things you hear is a line which is that because the tax cuts the government is taking in less money than the tax cuts of a lead to less revenue actually revenue went up\nRevenue went up not much but it was already high but revenue went out of the most recent since the tax cuts of of coming\nBy zero point four percent\nIncrease it's not a reduction how do I notice it's in the New York times okay it's in the New York times and their official government numbers check it out tax cuts do work go to tax cuts work dot com right now send a message to your members of Congress\nIs in trouble [noise] uh it now turns out that uh if you look at the number of birds that have an outside marriage [noise]\nIn the United states we are beyond forty percent\nAnd were perhaps approaching a day or\nThe statistician say not so long from now where the majority of children will be born into unleaded families now there are a couple of reasons why this situation is dire\nAnd they're in a couple of other reasons why it may not be quite as dire as we would suppose\nBut let me first I give you some of the background of that is put together through a new report from yup you got to the United nations the United nothing and it also puts America's problems in the context of the rest of the world if you believe it's no problem at all\nThen we have almost half of the children born in the United states born into a non married couple or you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number\n... Bloomberg an increasing number of birds happen outside of marriage signaling culture signaling cultural and economic shifts that are here to stay\nAccording to a major new report from the United nations\nForty percent of all births in the U.S now occur outside of wedlock\nThat is up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy was that means to put it in context as that\nIn less than fifty years the rate of out of wedlock birth has gone up four hundred percent\nWhy would that be\nA vis a report was issued by un FDA that as the United nations population fund it's the largest international provider of sexual and reproductive health services says\nThe numbers even higher in the European Union and the European Union already sixty percent of birds occur outside of marriage\nThey eat you report says likely sees more birds out of wedlock because many member countries have welfare systems that support gender balanced childcare\nSo that the senior advisor in economics for the un FBI his name is Michael heroin\nAnd in an interview\nHe said a public health care systems paid paternal leave early education programs in tax incentives\nGiven where parents support beyond what a partner can provide\nAnd is he saying from the un this is a good thing in Europe that you have sixty percent of kids born out of wedlock\nThat a good thing you think developmentally the government can do a better job than parents or even the government can do a better job than some parents by providing\nThese services one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\n[noise] look the problems with a single parent families are fairly obvious but\nOne of the things worth noting here with these numbers the reason that that I'm indicating to you that that forty percent number born out of wedlock\nAnd maybe a bit overstated at least in terms of meaningful consequences is because that includes couples who are actually living together but have decided for whatever reason not to get married\nAnd it is unclear what percentage of people who have a baby outside of marriage then follow that up by getting married\nIt's not a small numbers at least twenty five percent\nAt least one out of four people were a baby is born to a couple of outside of marriage ended up getting married and particularly if they do that while the child is very young and has no recollection of and it it can provide some of the same benefits of marriage by we what are the benefits of marriage\nWas one of those things if you spent any time at all in your life around the baby you understand immediately it's an extra pair of\nHands and extra pair of eyes it's a extra love that can be provided to the child and if\nYou have one person who was also going to be responsible for trying to provide an income\nWell what happens to the child or two children and this is not to\nBlame a single mothers it's not to say that single mothers are terrible people or that because obviously there are wonderful wonderful results that do occur sometimes was single mothers but it's very\nVery difficult and single fathers same thing it can happen that that things will work out beautifully but the idea that there should be putting up as an ideal or isn't acceptable ideal\nI think it's very destructive and if you take a look at the vastly greater likelihood of being involved in poverty\nCriminality self destructive activities like opioid abuse every risk for bad outcomes with a child is increased by a child who was raised in a single parent household\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd somebody can say well what about gay marriage why uh what's what's been the impact there the fact is that gay marriage his remains so rare in the United states such a small percentage of the population one of the studying things in this sort of the Census Bureau\nOf the marriages that have taken place in this country since ... since the decision that basically\nAuthorize gay marriage for every state in the union less than one percent have been the same sex couples yeah it's a shockingly low number\nAnd that's shockingly low because a lot of people it assumed though there will be pent up demand there will be all these couples that have been waiting to get married still less than one percent the the highest rate for gay marriage in the country was\nGoing to be shot San Francisco Seattle was second but even in San Francisco there's been about one point for nine percent of all the marriages actually were marriages between a same sex couple\nThe data shows such births in the U.S and in the EU are predominantly to unmarried couples who are living together rather than to single mothers the report says the data suggests that\nSocietal and religious norms about marriage childbearing and women in the workforce of changed\nSaid Kelly Jones the director for the center on the economics of reproductive health at the Institute for women's policy research is it a good thing is they've changed\nI I I don't believe that it is in other words it was it fairly common in American lives and what were called shots done weddings\nWhere\nA couple actually concedes the baby before they're married not recommend it but they do but then there's social pressure for them to get married for the baby is welcomed into a married home of course that's more desirable\nAnd and by getting married you were making a commitment to that child into each other\n\nJust someone down the idea that in most cases and of course I understand there are exceptions there are some times spouses who are abusive and self destructive and terrible and that can be a terrible situation for a child but in most\nCases\nIt's better for a child to deal with both a loving mother and a loving father\n\nLet's go to your calls to Andrea in Columbus ohio Andrea you're on the map that show\n[laughter] thanks for taking my call you back um so um for me um I have a wonderful husband and um\nI I think that parents have to be mentally credits and they have to be physically present they have to be mentally president and whether you're a single parent or whether you're fortunate enough to have as well um you have\nTo be there for them and and unfortunately when it's just one person that has you carry the burden of thing they're physically and emotionally and spiritually um you can't do it all\nI mean you you can't specially if you're earning a living and deliberately and look it it's it's very difficult and this was not to say the preschool is an important and doesn't represent an important alternative\nIt's just that you see if we have in this country such a a a an inclination to not make value judgments event leads us to\nBe blind to the fact that it is more desirable for each child to come into the world in a married household\nIf we can establish that and agree on that\nThen we've lost the whole idea of constructive social norms one of the constructive social norms that is worth\nMaintaining it seems to me is not applauding open racism or open anti Semitism or open racial or religious hatred of any kind so why are Democrats still applauding an open hater we will get to that question to coming up on them and that show [noise]\nThat often a parent would die in the trial would or maybe you have to live with her grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show I think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded in in the day after these tranche\nBut what does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends are it sounds very open minded and terrific\nWhat does it mean I Would say that we need government programs horse\nThat would help that would uh specifically be tailored to kids living in a single parent situation\nOkay what kind of programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters the auto established government day care centers\nI think over ... ... would be one way I think manners where you dip your people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nOkay let me just mentioned something to you Bob\nI I understand that sounds very generous and very nice but you know what they're sometimes families were married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children and their financially press is it fair that people like that and we're having a tough time financially\nWith their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income\nTo provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nI I Know you're going to have a ... but uh I I I'm going to say this we should cut defense spending because it's just it's just not not necessary and we should also raised taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when you say I'm going to hate this on my shelves you down but the idea that hunting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the and opinion in most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs in the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and has been shown by a wealth of books and information\nAh there is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that the blue the lid off the welfare system in the way the welfare system has it been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson's great society\nActually encouraged out of wedlock birth\nAnd there are Democrats who were written about that Daniel Patrick Moynihan\nWho was a moderate Democrats [noise]\nRose about the problems with family structure in the United states and he predicted exactly where we are [noise] but if governments will wars out of wedlock birth of course they're going to get more of that we'll be right back uh with the wind has a a public figure go over\nAnd expressing hates for [noise] we'll get

she had on CNN I guess they met Louis because he used the term mom to refer to some of the\nOf true creeps on the Democratic side where mom being\nThe offices of Congress people who were attacking cars and motorists in Portland who were rolling in the streets in New York City says mom that fits\nBut sometimes there are people who get great respect in fact there's someone who has been a very close and an inspiration to a prominent candidate on the ballot\nAfter three weeks from now Nineteen days from now I'm a\nToilet Keith Ellison the nominee for attorney general in Minnesota who's not only been accused very credibly of sexual assault by his former girlfriend and who has supporting evidence et cetera et cetera it's not a break cameras are much worse but jeeze Alison has also\nBeen affiliated and refused to repudiate Louis Farrakhan and uh tell me if if this sounds like somebody who is very much concerned about building bridges and are helping\nEncourage understanding across racial and religious lines here's minister Farrakhan\nWhy people don't like phones [noise]\nSome of them respect me\nBut those have been out the vote\nA she she still to to allow him to be associated in any way with someone respectable\nIs a very real problem and this brings us to Farrakhan because if you look at ... history of just a cop Khamenei anti American hatred of his own country\nThe idea that he should be on stage as he was that Aretha Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from a former president the United states Bill Clinton\nAnd uh I Do not believe that Bill Clinton is anti Semitic in any way I don't believe he is a racist\nBut you you simply can't all of a sudden sale because Louis Farrakhan his old at this point\nAnd because he associates himself with um\nWith with black people and as a representative of black people than anything that he says that is filled with racial hatred and its racial hatred by way against white people in general and it's still toxic instill deserves some kind of sanctioned go ahead last year I\nI I understand that Michael connected one more point go\nOkay so my point is that where this is coming from where the misled or in my opinion a a black people who are very hatred of the mayor have full of of whites were coming from ... is a kind of a revolution are fighting back\nAbout what happened to them as a people over time\nWhereas the other direction when it was the Nazis or whomever they would've packing people not because they did anything to them they made up conspiracy theories and made off that these people were doing stuff against them ... it really\nOkay I look I I understand but if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of Turks against Armenians and the Turkish genocide against Armenians one of the justifications for that genocide which was real and it happened and and also big knowledge of Iraq and so the Armenian\nPeople work rules of the Turks and they were undermining it doesn't matter\nIf you were going to express irresponsible hatred toward any group based upon ethnicity or religious faith or there ought to be sanctioned and that doesn't mean that you want to be shut down by the government but it means that respectable people should John you\nLet's go to Calvin in Columbus ohio Calvin you're on the map that show\nAnd Michael thanks for taking my call you that

thousand six to eight\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number this came in from Jake in Seattle Jake writes in pretty sad day here you get on the mob train\nI was saying that I think it's post totally legitimate to say that one of the tactics the Democrats have used in this campaign and its unique to this campaign\nIs basically dispatching mobs some of which we understand are affiliated with organizations that are well funded\nTo disrupt Republican events to get into people's faces too I'm basically misbehave and contributed to this atmosphere of violence and confrontation\nJake says pretty sad to hear you get on the mob trained I've never had\nMuch or any respect for you well thank you are but I thought you were above that\nWas anyone calling the Tea Party protestors in two thousand Thirteen a mom it's a talking point Michael and you can't be above that nonsense if you partake in it\nOkay\nThe challenge to you out there and I'll take calls on it can you give me an example where\nThe Tea Party sessions acted like a mom\nWhere they tried to show someone down\nWhere they tried to disrupt something I mean when you're talking about mom they think about those code paying more ons\nWho continually continually continual it was literally several times in our disrupted the Kavanaugh hearings who flooded congressional offices one of his hallmarks of the Tea Party and I saw it with my own eyes\nThese are people who clean up after themselves they wouldn't have giant rallies and a giant march on Washington one that was run by Glenn Beck I think they have two hundred thousand people there that a lot of people\nAnd they made a very big point of asking people to pick up their litter and you can compare that to the inauguration crown\nOr any inauguration crowd it you cannot compare and the same way\nThat very very regularly or there would be people dispatched to conservative political rallies and he asked this includes Trump rallies to try to disrupt into shall be carried away\nAt it I won't say it never happens but it's very rarely happens with liberal candidates do you remember a time when when Hillary was forced to confront angry people chanting had her\nOr President Obama\nI I Do remember there were a couple of cases where President Obama had a heckler\nAnd he handled it very well and very classy and fine but it's so rare\nAnd uh again right now in this campaign\nYou have major political figures like the if the Democrats take over the house of representatives Maxine Waters Los Angeles will be the chair of the house committee on financial services committee has to do with regulating banks\nMaxine Waters is openly said that it is appropriate to act like a mom and to get into people's faces Mitch McConnell and his wife Elaine show I'm\nTed Cruz and Heidi have been basically assaulted at dinner we play the other day or a segment of Ted Cruz being assaulted at the airport\nJust the lack of decorum the mobster tactics that that's what\nWe're talking about and it is not equally distributed you cannot find current examples about that that are prominent\nOn the conservative side of things\nLet's go to your calls to Jake in Philadelphia Jake you're on the map that shows disagreement day\nThey're like oh I disagree with your use of a term anti Semitism it should be in the ... and that sort of Jews and their religion\nWell no uh because of Hitler made a a very big point of killing people including of people who were Jews would converted to Catholicism or there there's a saint of the Catholic Church who was a former Jewish communist intellectual ...\nHello what Hitler's friend or the semi the mafia of Jerusalem\nOkay right I ... I understand but the term anti Semitism was originally coined in Europe in central direct by a hold on hold on and it was coined by people to describe a hatred of Jews and you're right the Jews have been Europeans for a long time\nBut this argument about a ... whether it is a real anti Judaism is it is a religious\nArgument that goes down to religion\nIt does not go down to religion I I'm ... I'm Sorry sir they are\nFrom the church it started from the church fathers\nOkay it did not start from the church fathers had started long before that if you read about the book investor which dramatizes events in the fifth century bc\nOf there was a very classic anti Semitism by Hayman who wanted to wipe out all the Jews and the notion that this is all about religion would not explained the fact that very secular Jews\nI've also been targeted by anti Semitism had been leaving the Jewish religion and\nTaking the Jewish religion very un seriously or did not protect people at all from the Holocaust or from the ravages of plastic anti Semitism or to say it's anti Judaism uh also would ignore the fact that\nI um I people who have converted to Judaism by the way of sometimes been punished by death what's happened in Poland to ... a lot of them are are not blood ... ski [noise]\nBut that's another story in the uh [noise] Eighteen century\nWe will be white fashion disagreement disagreements about the ... have [noise] his last column was just published we'll get to that coming up [noise]\nAnd saying what should we do our children are are talking to my wife and myself children are nine and seven and I say hey mommy and daddy you drink too much\nAnd he said one of our kids set of uh the other day when my wife was having a second bloody Mary a month at lunch\nOkay and of course in the answer to them they never said you know maybe you do drink too much I mean it's and it turns out that they have a family history of alcoholism they got to be careful\nBut the ideas look life life has all kinds of challenges and sometimes it does make sense whether it's with marijuana or with booze certainly with opioids or any other kind of prescription drugs anything\nDon't make things more difficult for yourself then is absolutely necessary let's go to a Lauren in Houston you're on the Michael ... shows disagreement day\nHi Michael I'm my disagreement today is that we all are as Saudi Arabia\nWhy um because it's carrying on hundreds of thousands of Yemeni people it's bad and it's not a good influence for the United states towards other countries um and because you already jeopardizing rise in bomb okay what what what is the thing what if we\nWere really just taking our influence in our leadership position in from other countries\nOkay Lauren and Lauren what do you think would happen if a President Trump all of a sudden announce okay okay uh we're canceling this arms deal with Saudi Arabia where they're buying a hundred billion dollars worth of our arms that we make here what what would happen do you think they would get their arms from somewhere else\nThat's for sure ...\nAbsolutely they would they would for probably get them from China or Russia\nAnd a ... again what have we accomplished that I Do I Believe that Saudi Arabia's a problematic country I think is a corrupt and brutal autocracy it's a very problematic country\nBut do I believe that it would help the United states to completely alienate ourselves an end a working relationship with Saudi Arabia Thomas Friedman is a big liberal wrote a find peace in the New York times yesterday\nAnd that he's made the case that look we need reform and the whole Islamic world we need reform and the religion because the essence of what happened in September eleventh was not paying enough attention to the real threat of\nMurderous a neo fascist Islam O.
