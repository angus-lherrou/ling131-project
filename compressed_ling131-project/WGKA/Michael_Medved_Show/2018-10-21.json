presidential speculation when he's still only a state senator in Illinois before he's even been elected the U.S Senate\nOr ... who's a member of the house of representatives forty six years old he he could just dodge the whole thing even if he loses and the Senate he's not giving away he's collected so much money over sixty million total just thirty eight million in the last quarter\nHe's broken all kinds of records for fundraising because people are very very inspired by his rhetoric last night he had a tough night very good at answering questions but there was one question he was asked where the answer's gonna come back and bite him here's the question\nMy question would be a what would you say to Republicans and independents who are watching tonight and are contemplating about voting for you but are worried that should you when your main objective as senator would be to try to impeach President Trump\nOK tough question right because well let's listen to the way that uh the

to obstruct justice\nBut win by broad daylight on Twitter he asked his attorney general Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation I Would say that's obstruction inaction\nOkay goes on and basically what he's saying is yes he would go back to the house of representatives if he if he does go back to the house of representatives a I'd be not planning on it he's planning to be elected Senate that won't happen\nOr anything he favors impeachment\nAnd I think that's political poison I I think it it means that any moderates who was thinking of voting for better or because Ted Cruz is very conservative\nOr forget it I ... honestly it and people out there are things that are better workers answering this question of actively look people who love the idea of impeachment they're going to vote for him anyway\nBut why what is wrong congressman O'Rourke from getting an honest answer and saying look\nWe just want to find out the facts let the investigation work right now there is no

best US Senators he is is solid and and all of a sudden Dean Heller is winning his race in Nevada now there is no way that the Democrats take the U.S Senate\nIf Dean Heller wins in Nevada if if you

dinner and her humor has gotten a lot of attention but she also sent a serious message and the message was that\nOne of the things that has to happen in American politics is stopping the idea that if you disagree with somebody over a political issue that person with whom you disagree is necessarily evil\nThat is not true I Do not believe that the Democrats are in general evil\nAnd maybe some but I Can't even think of any off hand who who's an evil Democrat don't call me on your nominations for evil that we have a lot of undeserved eludes\nActually I Hope that all of them lose this time they will lose because we have a two party system in this country but the point about this is it there's a difference between evil and foolishness or even corruption\nAnd here's what a Nikki Haley had to say about this at the Al Smith dinner and she said it so well that well let's just have her say it herself\nWe've had some last night poking fun at ourselves and our\nThat really do want to share something I Believe is important as a and a lot when I speak to high school students\nAnd the college students and our toxic political environment I'd heard some people in both parties described their opponents as enemies or evil and America\nAnd South Sudan where rape is routinely used as a weapon\nThat is evil\nIn Syria where the dictator uses chemical weapons to murder innocent children that is evil\nAnd North Korea where American student Otto Warmbier was tortured to death\n... in the last two years I've seen ...\nWe have some serious political differences here at home\n[noise] we're blessed with a political system that allows us to resolve our differences peacefully in the end we must recognize that we are all Americans and we are stronger and healthier when we are United\nOkay I think it's tough to disagree with that and particularly in the context of what I began by talking about which is the case of a Christian Woman whose name as a C a bb she's illiterate but then a lot of people in Pakistan are particularly women\nAnd by the way that's not an anti woman comment that's a pro woman comment I mean one of the things that is deeply dysfunctional about a lot of the Islamic countries in the world is that uh they don't provide any education for the women\nIn any event she's Christian and uh\nShe has been on death row in two thousand ten what is her crime well here is the

in\nPunjab to Muslim women accused ms baby a farm worker and a a mother\nA mother of five in fact they accused her of polluting the cop that they were all drinking from on this hot day bigger she drank from it and she's not a Muslim\nSo in the midst of this argument allegedly ms baby told them Jesus died on the cross for the sins of mankind what did your prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind\nNow it's not even clear she actually said that because under Pakistani law to\nTalk about blasphemy is blessed than me so all you're allowed to do is say she committed blasphemy you're not allowed to cross examine the witnesses she's been condemned to death since two thousand ten she lives in a windowless cell there have been international efforts to free her\nAnd um [noise]\nIf it's just unbelievable they're already people who have died in her case a shortly after the span villagers accused ms Bebe of blasphemy and they had or imprison\nThe following year record censored to death

it's an unbelievable thing\nThis is a nuclear power now why am I talking about this right now not only because there was attention to her case and there's a new president of Pakistan among ... who says he's a reformer he's a former cricket star\nAnd maybe just maybe he will show some mercy on this poor woman the problem is the president con\nUh supports the blasphemy law the idea that someone should be executed for saying something that disagrees with the religious beliefs of Ninety seven percent of Pakistanis\nOr the entire thing is mad and it's difficult and it brings us to this um the ... incident I uh I have been troubled by some voices on the right\nWho want to say that to show the at one time and his wife had been sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly moved away from that if you read his last column that he wrote before he died that was just published earlier this week in the Washington Post\nA she was no Islamist he he was calling on Islamic countries to allow more press freedom ironically\nThe the idea that anyone would try to justify or minimize the hideous nature of what apparently was done to Mr show he said I actually think President Trump and secretary palm pay on particular have been getting it about right\nYou can't go off and say well we support other reforms that Mohammed bin Salman is doing therefore this is okay we have to look past it\nBut you also can say we're going to blow up our entire relationship with Saudi Arabia which is a regional power and as a very important ally the United states over this one episode\nAnd\nIt's it's a remarkably important that we move forward we will form of some unity and not make this into a political issue one of the things that the Democrats do wrong as they want to make every last thing about Trump\nAnd or\nDo I think that Trump made a mistake or comparing well saying that they he should be innocent until proven guilty of like Brett Kavanaugh comparing\nThe potential murder to the uh legit and I believe imagined a song by a Seventeen year old high school guy who ... and and the ... was halted the culminating roping\nI've to compare that to a brutal murder and dismembered men and torturing a guy in cutting off his fingers and and then slicing of his body to transport out of the country [noise] this is not comparable\nAnd it's also not comparable because this was done in the name of government I'll tell you what scares me most about the show the story\nIs that\nStupidity if sometimes more frightening than arrogance or pure evil and how do we do have to be if you're planning to murder some journalists to try to do it in the consulate in a foreign power what do you think is going to happen\nHow can you imagine you're not going to get caught maybe they wanted to get what they wanted to send a message but that's equal to send a message through murder and torture is hideous and it's evil and that's wrong\nMe stories the one from Pakistan which is hideous the

dear Abby now on the call has been taken over by genes Philips who was the daughter of the original dear Abby but\nShe was asked a question about a very complicated elaborate foreign sounding name that someone was considering\nGiving a child and dear Abby said this not only can foreign names be difficult to pronounce and spell but they can also call a child calls a child to be teased on mercifully\nSometimes the name can be a problematic word in the English language and one that sounds beautiful and a foreign language can be grading English\nBy the way when I read that I immediately thought of of a problem that some Israeli Americans have\nA very common popular a Hebrew name Israeli name is ...\nAnd a are more on I mean but seriously you don't want to name your daughter\nOr your son moron and not not in in this country and not in this culture that probably better name to choose now the point about this dear Abby thing is all hell has broken lose for dear Abby\nPeople have claimed that she is affirming white privilege that there is a racial thing and there's no racial in what she said but of course the New York times is ready to make\nIt racial they have a column that says I'm the heated reaction to the column which has been a staple in American households for decades\nAnd was started by miss Philips mother who use the pen name Abigail Van Buren this seed reaction has inspired a fresh debate about identity acceptance and racism\nAbby's column was deeply infuriating and also revel at Torrey said a a a woman named uh Valerie cower\nAbby is clean to an old America were white is considered the norm and everything else deviant an inferior\nMusk our added that she and her partner believed it was more important to honor a child's heritage and connect them then heritage then for a name to be easy to pronounce\nOkay fine Abby was not suggesting that anyone is just giving advice do I think it's reasonable advice sure do we have very very dear friends who have given or their children very difficult names we do absolutely\nAnd you get used to it uh and now I'm not talking about you Greg a though Gregg is laughing here can I mention the names of your children okay they named their kids after inanimate objects penny a river\nAnd Jonas but none of those names or that hard to spell or they'll I don't know maybe it would be probably people there are probably people who spelled penny wrong but not many uh okay that's the point about the point about this it just seems to me\nIs why is everything about race well because people make it about race they a quote someone named a non zero right is he's a writer who writes about socialism and about the evils of capitalism\nHe says is the reality that a lot of this has to do with names\nBut more with white and is there a lot of complicated names from polish in Russian and Italian and German backgrounds that have become second nature to Americans\nThe unusual names referred to in the dear Abby column aren't unique in their complexity he said they're unique in their complex and they tend to come from places where people aren't white\nThat is nonsense I mean I I think it's very difficult if ah if somebody and they are\nAll kinds of names which could understand would be would be difficult and challenging and by the way my last name is difficult and challenging my father's older brother\nMy uncle ... uh uh his his name was Moshe method and he changed his name to\n... more stuff and that was the way he did business because it was easier for business a dove Hebrew or the Hebrew word for bear is does and the Russian word for bears method yeah yet so okay\nThis seems to me inane but then we have we have this and this is a piece in the Washington Post\nAs sexual assault survivors continue to share their stories barking worldwide have to ask me to reckoning actress Kristen Bell\nWho was one of the voices and frozen of course is publicly expressing concern about Snow White and the prince who kiss so white without consent\n[noise] Abdel who provide voice of Princess Diana and Disney's animated film frozen told parents magazine that when she read Snow White toward two young daughters she poses the question [noise] don't you think that is weird that the press prince kisses Snow White\nWithout her permission [noise] because you cannot just someone if they're sleeping well she's not just leaving mostly banned in that movie right she's been buried they've had a funerals he's in a coffin and the prince rings or back to life okay then you'll have Sleeping Beauty is also kiss without her permission but also brings her back to life [noise]\nIt you know don't cut me off on this I have a lot to say that little girl in the bathroom you don't think that would happen that little government that that comes from politicians politicians are going to be able to do that because now you don't have the gods now\nYou know knows no evil the guns now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look at him the the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things have politicians do sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision\nWhere the Washington state's Supreme Court\nAh basically said that uh they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's the life imprisonment that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults but for people convicted of murder\nAs adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen you can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this then I think is profoundly wrong but see we we lose the battle to him if we lose the language and evil loses all of its meaning\nIf you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters\nAnd equating her with a these people in Pakistan who were literally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that the Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nUm okay you get to argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians what a defender\nThat it seems to me is a very different matter\nAnd this is also one of the problems that the people had an and there were people of this nature\nOr stolen was evil Hitler was evil so why is it that we sent millions of dollars billions of dollars worth of equipment and support and supplies to stolen so that he could be ... answer because it was necessary for\nSaving the world and uh there was one danger that was more immediate at the time that that happened I mean well uh there is a a new TV show

happened to be here thanks for having me\nOn the uh\nI I we don't want to spoil or a as certainly not the ultimate spoiler but the the interesting premise year is that um that God has friended the

you um\nDo you pay off what is really going on here uh or is it left something of a mystery\n[noise] well I think it's it's definitely to be left something as mystery for the for the future but it's something we attacked directly in terms of the mythology of the show which is the search for who is behind the guy to count as a God or is it something else but I think as as the mystery of life that is the mystery of the of the show\nScraped and returned Haddonfield home\nI Need to protect my family is a real problem with that is not safe to be on the street tonight\nIs a killer he will be killed tonight happy Halloween Michael\nOkay happy Halloween to everybody by the way there's no ... or ... there is an implication in this film that Michael could be the Boogie Man but basically he uh he has a psycho with a back story the back stories alluded to here also which is that he murdered his sister and the first film\nWhen he was six years old so it was a troubled guy\nUm look if you like this kind of movie at all\nThis is a terrifically well done what's interesting is John ... is one of the producers but the real guiding force is younger director named David Gordon Green has directed a bunch of independent films need pineapple express with Seth Rogen\nBut nothing preparing you for the expertise of this one one of the things that is really astonishing about the film when you think about it\nIs it's incredibly creepy is very disturbing is the kind of fill my wife would hate every minute of\nBut it does what the best horror films do is get you to forget about your own troubles whatever they may be I mean if you're thinking about politics from Albany are annoyed about uh the Senate race or the governor's race in California plenty of be annoyed about there\nAre all of a sudden now you're thinking about wait a minute what's lurking behind that door that's been left a jar\nBut the brilliance of the film is it is minimalist filmmaking this is not a body count movie there aren't that many people who get murdered and you don't see blood gushing forth with to big spouts of blood\nIt's subtle one of the most disturbing images in the film\nAt one point you don't know what's happened to a character and then you see someone dropping a bunch of removed bloody teeth on the floor and you can hear them rattling on the floor\nIt's scary it's disturbing it's rated R A N Jamie Lee Curtis is outstanding she plays a grandmother ... oh yeah Kyle Smith over at National Review sees this as a right wing movie because it's about certainly is about gun rights I mean this part of what the film is about\nAs about defending yourself and about how foolish it is to believe that the world is all full of sweetness and light and everyone is well intentioned there's also by the way of very surprising twist at the end involving one of the main characters\nAnd I won't even hint at it because the surprise when it comes to shocking to give away three stars for Halloween or by the way it it basically clears away all those other inferior sequels in the middle because it says in the film what Michael Meyers has been in this\nInsane asylum for forty years said yup yup yes so all those other adventures in the other sequels forget about this was the one\nThree stars for the R rated Halloween I'll let us go to Elmer in Seattle Elmo you're on the Michael Mann that show\nMy garden

evil\nYet yeah and I don't think Maxine is evil I've I've met her eye and by the way I Know I don't agree with her about anything but she is one of those members of Congress that people say very nice things about apparently she's a very nice kindly person they color anti Maxine\nYeah we have our differences given but it led some even let someone talk about it like that you know Donald Trump\nThe

politicians really me and making it all for your freedom and liberty\nOver two weeks until America votes and the Democrats are stunned by the self immolation of a prominent fake Indian senator we'll

coast on the radio America network\nWill the blue wave hit land or will they crash out at sea as it crashed in or waning\nAnd what about the fallout from Senator Elizabeth Warren ill fated attempt to

the latest wave of judicial nominees for President Trump including one which will find quite surprising [noise]\nSo it's been quite a series of self inflicted October surprises for Democrats hoping to take control of the house and possibly even the Senate\nThey tried to destroy judge Brett Kavanaugh but failed porn star Stormy Daniels sued President Trump and Xi failed and winds up having to pay Trump's legal fees\nThis week a major contender for the twenty twenty democratic presidential nomination Elizabeth Warren shoots herself into foot with a bow and arrow\nThe Democratic candidate for governor of Illinois has sued by his own campaign staff\nFor his insufficient commitment to racial diversity the Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia says blue wave voters will consist of both the documented and undocumented\nOr the Democrats blowing what seemed to be a sure thing just a few weeks ago a mid term tie that would lift all their boats and grant them control of the U.S house of representatives and possibly even the Senate\nIf the Democrats only needed to pick up say a dozen seats to take over the house they might still be in good position\nBut they need a net gain of twenty three seats a more daunting task to be sure but still very achievable for the party out of control of the White House in midterms\nLet's take a look back in Nineteen Ninety four when Bill Clinton was president Republicans picked up fifty four seats in the house and ate in the Senate in a true wave election that came to be known as the Newt Gingrich revolution\nBut that was based around a specific set of reforms proposed by the geo pay that came to be known as the contract with America we see no evidence that Democrats have assembled any sort of coherent platform outside of resistance to Trump this year [noise]\nFast forward to the two thousand Chen midterms when Republicans picked up an astounding sixty three seats in the house and six in the Senate affective Lee new during President Obama's legislative agenda for the remaining six years of his presidency\nThat one was based last on a Republican agenda then widespread opposition to Obamacare\nNow facts are facts the hardy of the incumbent president has lost ground during mid term elections Ninety percent of the time over the last century with an average loss of thirty seats in the house and for in the Senate\nAnd only two midterms in the last century has the president's party actually gained seats in both houses\nSo Republicans will be fighting history but it's certainly possible they might lose say a half dozen or a dozen seats or even twenty and still control the house\nSo boy ding impeachment hearings and all manner of investigation certain region up by committees headed by\nMajority Democrats over in the Senate where Democrats are forced to defend two thirds of the seats up for election this year Republican prospects are brighter there should be able to at least hold and perhaps add to their razor thin\nThe one forty nine majority\nBut another overarching issue going back to the founding of the republic is that the American people light divided government or put another way the voters are very wary of one party controlling the presidency the Senate and the house no matter which party it is\nSo Well Donald Trump shattered many a political tradition and changed the way politics has done a couple of years ago he and the Republicans are fighting a very powerful under Joe of resistance not just to him but to the very notion of one party dominance\nBut in revealing the bidding for this particular mid term election one side can boast and in ... but she men's and mold breaking the other pledges to resist at all costs were in\nThe most polarized political environment in decades the two thousand Eighteen Democrats are positioned as a party openly proclaiming their intention to resist all things Trump\nAnd little else they've offered no coherent platform other than to fine Trump at every turn\nNow Democrats can talk all day one about the impeachment of Trump or Brett Kavanaugh if they gained control of the house\nBut they know full well that the chances of fulfilling their real ambition of removing either of them are almost zero that two thirds vote in the Senate required to remove either one will never happen\nApps and dramatic intervening events\nNow Democrats have hardly been alone and obstructing a president of the opposing party Republican similarly tried to block almost every move by President Obama Senator Mitch McConnell\nPledged to make Obama a one term president but there is a crucial distinction here GOP opposition that year was based strictly on policy rather than Obama's widely appealing persona\nThis time it's deeply personal\nThe laughs searing hatred for Trump is in the words of Hillary Clinton era deemed mobile\nThey will never ever believe that the American people could possibly a lack of vulgarity and unless things were not on the level and it must have been Russia or the FBI or whatever\nYou call it irrational ... believes it down to the marrow of their loans\nExpect the president and his GOP allies to in turn Spanta ample time in the run up to election day\nPounding home the specter of congressional power turned over to the terrifying trio of Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and of course Maxine Mad Max waters\nNow compared to the Democrats immovable object of hatred for Trump to the irresistible force of the president's documented results\nIn less than Twenty one month she has pushed through massive deregulation at a game changing tax reform bill providing a shot of adrenalin to an economy that has out paste even the most optimistic expectations more than four percent growth and the latest quarter\nThe stock market is up forty percent since Trump's election four million new jobs have been created including more than four hundred thousand and manufacturing sector's written off as hopeless unemployment has reached historically low levels in fact\nAt three point seven percent we're near what economists consider full employment and most notably jobless rates have hit new lows among the Democrats most important constituencies blacks and Hispanics and women\nTrump has used the full leverage of American economic and military strength the cuts superior international deals such as the latest with Canada and Mexico\nAnd to pull out of others foremost among them the nuclear deal with Iran and the Paris climate accord have dramatically changed the course of relations with the nation many consider to be the greatest threat to America North Korea\nAnd the long ago she ate it release of American pastor Andrew Brunson by turkey this last week now brings the number of Americans liberated from far in captivity since Trump took office up to Eighteen\nTrump has broken the mold of how businesses to be done he served notice\nThat unlike previous presidents he is not owned by anyone\nAnd will not be bound by tradition considered Trump's latest venture into the land of this is not how you're supposed to do it have publicly criticized the Federal Reserve\nAnd did something few Democrats have done in a debate with cruise this week you use the words of President Trump against his Republican opponent\nSenator Cruz and not going to be honest with you and he's going to make up positions and votes that I've never held them or have ever taken on for the president called them wind to why the nickname so because as before\nIt's clear congressman O'Rourke pollsters have told him to come out on the attack so if they want to insult man calling me a liar that's fine but you know John Adams famously said facts are stubborn\nThings were all talk and no action\nNow Cruz is still well ahead and may be pulling away in that race and many have said that they do work pushing a full bore progressive agenda in Texas\nIs not actually running for the Senate but staging a demo for a presidential campaign in two years when his name might be added to the dozens of Democrats all ready fantasizing about a knockout to Donald Trump in twenty twenty\nOne of the things Republicans are trying to do is we approach election day November six is invoke the name of Hillary Clinton whenever and wherever possible\nAnd the tone deaf loser of the two thousand sixteen presidential election gave them more fodder this week when she was questioned on CBS about her husband stressed when the Monica Lewinsky which led to his impeachment\nIn retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at the incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to what in adult but\nLet me ask you this where the investigation of the current incumbent against to numerous allegations have been made that does it\nChange the subject so people might forget that you just just divide your husband's sex with an intern in the White House Democrats by the way are practically begging this woman to leave the stage but she won't\nFinally an interesting perspective on how Donald Trump has evolved from candidate to president it comes from Leslie stall up CBS after she interviewed Trump as a candidate then as president elect and then as president on sixty minutes last Sunday\nIn terms of the three interviews he was completely different\nFrom one that really stood out was the one three days after he won the
