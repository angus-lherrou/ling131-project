influence on the boat coming up in November So it's hard to say that there's not an more important story I mean this was it um which one you want to check first\nWell let's let's first or take a look at what you think the impact is likely to be on the vote November\nWell I think it's going to be a tremendous backlash against people um who espouse no presumption of innocence which is the Democratic party\nThe only one Democrat voting for capital on that show managing the senator from West Virginia one\nSo now you know the other what forty seven uh basically saying look we're with a mock\nWhere what the people who accused Kavanaugh without any corroborating evidence with the FBI all ready now said there isn't any\nAnd we're still with the ... we we want to get the pitchforks and the and the fire porches and march up the hill okay so Americans\nAre getting that they're getting it and they say well what if this happened to my father or brother or husband would I Want to know presumption of innocence but I Want the man to be destroyed by allegation and of course the answer is going to be no so the Republicans are smart and that's a big\nTell you that they run on two things the economy and the Democratic party rejecting the presumption of innocence and I think that both of those things will be helpful to geo care November\nI'm One of the other things we now have officially the lowest unemployment rate in a forty nine years with three point seven percent\n... you have to go back to Nineteen sixty nine\nTo find and unemployment rate this low that's that's no worthy to I ... I ... you talked about the presumption of innocence now again you're in a unique position talking about anything having to do with hash tag me to or accusations about\nMistreatment of women because that's had a very big impact on your life in your career\nOr do you think we may be reaching a turning point in this whole narrative that says that anyone who makes any accusations at all\nShould be a ... instinctively support it do you think that is likely to begin to change\nYeah I'm constrained oh what I can say because uh I have to leave the legal action in play to restore my reputation and of course it takes a lot of money and a lot of time to do that so I Can't really get into my situation I can tell you the same people\nWho are now paying demonstrators to disrupt the capital or will behind um my accusations and they paid people to stand out front on Fox News would saut same exact people I've seen groups\nIt's outrageous it's an outrage\nThe problem with the accusation industry and that's what it is now Michael it's an industry\nAll right and it's run by two forks ... lawyers who are shakedown auditors who know they can uh get money from individuals and corporations just by the obligation because the corporations and individuals don't want a public that's a shakedown industry has been in place now for decades\nNow you have the allegation industry used by political people All right so if we don't why cabinet or we can't the feed him on the merits it was going to be confirmed so we're going to put out a a a letter from a woman who says well he he uh molested me when I was Fifteen Years old okay so that's what\nThat's what happened that's what they did\nAnd of course the wild card in this was to press the trash is the driver primary driver of the political allegation industry because depressed doesn't care what's true\nThey didn't know searching in my case at all none zero and we provided fresh salads with the scope Pretoria evidence that in print it\nThey wouldn't even use it I mean CNN and use the word rape in conjunction with a cabin all more than a hundred times\nMore than a hundred times CNN are associated cabinet with weight\nAnd it ... none of these accusers uh\n... ever even alleged that he raped anyone did they\nKnow what one dead one did a ... that that\n... went and they said as as sweat and they said she thought he participated in a drug gang spiking punch and paying jobs that\nGirls could be raped by a a line of boys\nRight and which are there any line but that in the beginning the cabin always in the line\nAnd then she hold back on that\nOne out what I'm trying to get across is and this is very important for people understand is that the corrupt American media and it is as corrupted has ever been in our republic doesn't care what happened they want the salacious headline alright they want to tag powerful people with this\nOkay let me just interrupt you for a moment and a rather momentous announcement Joe mansion just Santa vote yes\nHe will vote yes on Kavanaugh which means that he has a sure now of fifty one votes he will be confirmed he needs fifty go ahead\n[noise] what mansion and you know if it wants Collins came across mansion then had nothing to lose so I'm not either I'd like Collins was sincere\nAnd somewhat brave but mansion I liked mansion I like to I Know um but he just waited back and say oh well now it's the issue with things well say yes\nBecause as you know if it's a pie in the Senate the vice president breaks the tie and a Kevin was fair right measure that putting any currency on the line now because Schumer the Senate minority leader threatened all the Democratic senators by saying if you support Kavanaugh will cut off all your money\nSo when you run for reelection not getting any money from the national committee\nThat don't you Schumer did\nDon't you think this is going to Heidi Heitkamp who's already running I think nine or ten points behind a in her\nRace in North Dakota I held and come back and and she'll lose in North Dakota\nYeah but but again it's hard to understand\nWhy you see this this was a point when you listen to senator Collins\nShe brought out the point that that look up a Brett Kavanaugh is not some extreme legal theorist he's a respected judge he's writing the Republican mainstream\nHe's about as a moderate an appointee as they could possibly hope for from Donald Trump so what's what is behind this the hysterical this\nIs what democracy looks like no no ... got to go\nThe demonstrators and the craziness that they're not all rented demonstrators Amy Schumer got herself arrested ... what does she have in this fight\nAbortion what it is the progressive left knows that the states many of the Mississippi is the latest and Missouri and there as well are trying to limit\nA timeframe on abortion abortion clinic access things like that many of those cases will go to the Supreme Court and a Kavanaugh will most likely come down on the side that the states have a right to regulate commerce which is what abortion has come down to now Planned Parenthood\nA they have a constitutional right to regulate\nCommerce within their borders so the far left the progressive should control the Democratic party and the media basically say we can't have this guy\nBecause he's going to come down on the side of the states to limit abortion we want unfettered abortion abortion under any reason under any circumstance at any time that's what we watched\nAs what any Schumer watch that's what Hillary Clinton walk and that's what that's why the um Kavanaugh train a picked up speed once\nIt looked like he was going to be confined beats all about abortion\nLet me also mention a Bill O'Reilly is my guest she has a new\nBestseller that is going to be released next week it is called killing the ss\nThe hunt for the worst war criminals in history\nOr it's going to be available next week you can find out about the link to it at our website and Michael midday dot com\nAnd another fascinating read on a dramatic an astonishing chapter in world history we will be right back with more reactions pouring in every where on the parents victory for Brett Kavanaugh more coming right up thank you Bill O'Reilly\nEighty five ... she's dying breath areas or why he's seven a year or two\nYeah he's he's yes I think he may be Seventy nine he's yes they're they're both\nThe liberal lions and as you said and it could happen any time so but the court now is uh where Trump watch a debate even if you a Republican you voted for him you know like um you know like a style you know like you handled himself now um the court is a traditional court again\nBut if he if he if Trump and let's say that Justice Ginsburg resigns and President Trump a points Amy Coney Barrett who apparently was the runner up to ...
