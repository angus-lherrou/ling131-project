not think that here we are teenagers really matters a lot in terms of the lifestyle lifted the adult et cetera however think contrition plays a big part in that\nI think that if we make mistakes and our younger and we are appropriately can tried it out that we have a desire to um pitch change if we have a desire to make good with that people that we heard\nI I don't think that that happens in all cases and I think that a lot of this issue is just a broad general issue\nAnd it specifically related to the topic that brought it up as it turned out that I'm Kevin I was guilty about something and then was not can try no he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court I personally believe that he's not guilty because victims addict them I didn't believe her story\nI I Want to bounce off of all of you nationwide something that is striking my Texas audience because I don't know if it's geographic out of its ideological I don't know if it's objective I don't know if it's wishful thinking um because it is also fresh so new and so ever changing hour by hour\nUsually I've got a pretty good um\nYou know radar on on what is inside my Bible and and looking outside my bubble to make sure that my wishful thinking or my politics don't in views of the things that I Would say that that I consider to be objectively true so here's what I'm Talking about\nThis attack this smear campaign against Kavanaugh\nIs backfiring big time or around the country fair minded people not all of them conservatives some of them don't you want capital on the court but they have the basic human decency to realize or a disgusting eggs are crumble smear when they see one\nAbsolutely believe that feel free to corroborate it or deny it's a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you know the numbers or follow me on Twitter ... Mark Davis that many arcade Davis always go to the Michael ... on Twitter at\n... show and Michael ... dot com even when the filling the guys are here right so uh I I've just I've talked to so many people that I've read so many things that I've talked to other people who do this for a living\nAnd they're telling the same thing that that people are sick of this that it it has become\n... and ... it has become ludicrous we've gone from a\nAn allegation of sexual assault that was worthy enough to bring a woman in an effort to sit down and share testimony which she did a that story is falling apart there is no corroboration of it and the subsequent stories New Yorker and among the arm of ah of\nAttorney Michael ... those those ... those are less credible and Dr Ford and that saying something\nAnd and now we're getting into ice wars and uh and and didn't miss sweating it who doesn't remember whether that was Brett or not at or near a punch bowl but he had some red solo cups that I wasn't going to take a red solo cup from Brett Kavanaugh\nIt it's ... it's theater absurd it has gone from political theater to the editor of the absurd\nI wrote a town hall dot com column this morning posted the dawn my time so it's been up there for a few hours out to share a couple of thoughts from it\nAnd um and then get some thoughts from you we got some audio Richard Blumenthal which is always enjoyable there's just something delicious Lee\nTwisted about Richard Blumenthal democratic Connecticut lecturing anyone about truth telling Mr stolen valor they these folks they they they have no shame they just have no shame will also try again to diagram sentences for Mazie Hirono is just just always an adventure uh\nAnd and well we're both track the moving the goalposts and just sort of see where it's all going so my question for you either an overall broad question for you [noise]\nUh and and that is is is what's happening before our eyes\nWhat is happening before our eyes I strongly feel that the nation is on to this campaign I don't mean unanimously\nThere are plenty of liberals plenty of Democrats and\nMany due listening and I'd love to hear from you as well 'cause we take all comers or the Michael bad vet show as you know Michael does that when he's here and I do it every any show I'm hosting Meyer somebody else's I absolutely welcome opposing views but I Will tell you something and and we have a little bit of experimentation with his yesterday here's my belief\nShow me a\nTwenty people who want to obsess about a Brett Kavanaugh's calendar\nAnd who are just so convinced that his testimony just doesn't jibe with what the realities of early eighties party life we're\nFinding a mate among those twenty people are some folks who are really concerned about judge Kavanaugh's temperament to I mean oh my gosh he he really blew his cool in in some questioning with Amy Clampitt shark Sheldon Whitehouse and I don't know if we can ask temperament like that\nOn the court and blah blah blah blah buzzwords find me twenty people who are all twisted off about ... side shows the irrelevant sees the ridiculous nest\nAnd the you know what's driving every single\nOne of them they don't want him on the\nCourt because he's a constitutional list they don't they don't care about how he might have treated women when they were Seventeen years old because the people who are telling you that thing about probably had no problem with Bill Clinton probably have no problem with with that candidate\nBill Clinton find no problem Ted Kennedy find no problem but Brett Kavanaugh whoa no surgery can't go there\nThat that's when you know that something else is driving the train and what's driving the train here in in this really is so simple and once you understand it becomes easier to grass and you know what's going on here\nEntire episode has nothing\nTo do with women are concerned about who did or did not treat her miss treat women properly in the eighties\nAny other time every single bit of this is smoke is smoke and what's behind the smoke\nIs the true motivation\nAnd that is that the campaign against Brett Kavanaugh\nIs being launched by and embraced by people who do not want a constitutional list on the Supreme Court\nThat's because constitutional lists do make stuff up in their rulings they don't make up right that don't exist like\nThe right to terminate a pregnancy which was absolutely fabricated from whole cloth and roe v Wade in Nineteen Seventy three and this is extremely important\nI don't want roe versus Wade overturned because I'm pro life\nBrett Kavanaugh will not vote to overturn roe v Wade because he is a conservative or a pro lifer and by the way I've no idea what he'll do but if he's a genuine constitutional as the will absolutely vote to overturn it not to forward his political views are his political agenda\nBecause judges should keep justices especially should keep all those things out of there ... all that matters is is there a right to abortion and the constitution of course there is not\nLet's talk about the over ... versus a hundred twenty Fifteen gay marriage ruling thanks Anthony Kennedy for that\n[noise] that this was a completely unconstitutional ruling that said the state not only the state could offer gay marriage equality because of course they can states can do whatever they want in terms of the definition of marriage but over versus Hodges said they had to\nThey had to\nGo you've got to to make sure that women can abort their babies I Know you've got to make sure that states a rule that a a marriage of two guys is the same as my marriage to my wife\nYou know if a state wants to end by the way that that conversely applies to abortion is what little constitutions one on one if you need at the moment roadways overturned in that they cannot come fast enough for a moment rosy way to overturn what happens what happens\nFirst dangerous close to nothing immediately the answer is nothing but the landscape that then left is every state can have whatever abortion laws they wish would over fell versus Hodges overturned every state can recognize the marriages that they wish\nIf state number one wants to have full marriage equality to do two ladies ... whatever you want to do it's all marriage to us that's great but it's a state next door says not so much one man one woman that that they get to do that\nIf state hey wants to have ghoulish ally permissive abortion laws I Will lamented if I Lived in that state I'd fight doggedly against it but they can do it\nAnd it's a state next door says new we're going to be very restrictive we're going to\nAbsolutely protect the unborn in many many ways that we haven't even been able to do before that state gets to do that all of that that I've just described hoping to make your wrecked a car or anything that's called respecting the constitution this is the kind of America that Brett Kavanaugh will help bring about in other words ... left\nAnd removing their ability to legislate through court rulings to get from the judiciary that which they cannot get from legislatures this has been an ongoing game of the left for decades and it is over when constitutional is reached the high court\nBrett Kavanaugh is just such a person God Bless him\nAnd um that's that's what it's all about because that that is the garlic too of empire that that is is kryptonite to the left\nSo that's what it's all about it and nothing to do they're concerned about Dr Ford listen we're all concerned about that for some math but our one that Brett Kavanaugh's hands that I Wish her well I have no ill will toward her whatsoever or go leader good happy and prosperous life oh I bet it'll be prosperous her calendar will soon fill\nWith a with book deals and I'm\nSpeaking engagements plenty I'm sure that I Wish you well I don't begrudge or any of that [noise] so I tell you when I get to have it on the court are we going to do that is that going to happen to you feel like we're closer today than we were yesterday or could it all just goes sideways answer is yes it could and I'll tell you why next Mark Davis in for Michael that stick around\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six Michael Mann vigil [noise] am nine twenty the answer [noise] life insurance is\nThat was perfect your ... somebody said here's you

thirty three eighty eight or just go to Michael ... dot com and quite prepare already a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six one eight hundred nine five five one seven seven six we've been talking about a ... what what does it look like and what the real fear of the left is and why we're even involved in this entire\nYou know crazy mess with a a judge Kavanaugh's because the left fears of ... with a with every fiber of it's being a constitution list on the Supreme Court and so what would that look like what kind of rulings would you have\nAnd many many things like roe v Wade which established a phony abortion rights\nA overkill versus Hodges which established a phony obligation for all states to have a gay marriage equality that would be a state by state patchwork vats what honoring the constitution looks like a with a question that we had to yellow city or in San Antonio Ron Hi Mark Davis in for Michael how are you\nOh great great I I guess Arnie or a little better for her position on this they deciding state by state basis\nHow does that work because it's like back in or when you had interracial marriages were to be illegal in Texas but illegal in Oklahoma or legal or in Arkansas but illegal in Alabama or\nOn that I Am I right here's here's here's here's here's exactly here's exactly how it would work\nMarriage one oh one if two people get married there are three levels of of of marriage marriages religious which means something inside of the promises they make before God but the couple does before God second in his social\nUh meaning does your your people around you your family your friends consider you to be married in may and if so that certainly has of either being married and the third is government recognition of yet that's the only one that's everybody's business the other to the social the religious or none of anybody's business a gay couple can get married today anywhere they wish\nAnytime the only question is will the state recognize that marriage there's no such thing as a marriage ban nobody will ever bang on a church you think you guys getting married in there they they absolutely can get married the only question is will the state recognizing that\nAn institution in our went out on almost on almost on almost on almost done when the constitution is offered some states will recognize those gay marriages and some will not go ahead\nOkay uh so I went in traveling across the country and they're in a state that ... and when they got to recognize there I don't know what kind of ramble that even if you go on abortion first state to state one\nWay back on it and I came back up to marriage back back up to marriage\nBut let's say a couple is married in Connecticut\nTo do to marry in Connecticut and their marriages recognized or you just talking about there vacationing there driving across country or they suddenly not married as they pass through Kansas [laughter] no of course they are but the state of Kansas doesn't recognize it doesn't matter because they don't live there are the only thing that marriage government recognition of marriage only extends to\nTax benefits in certain laws in certain ... certain mad ... they're still married in the most important ways religiously and socially now if they move to Kansas well that's another cat\nFish 'cause they're still married absolutely but it's not a marriage that the state recognizes with certain perks that come with marriage recognition so it's not really that big a deal that what was the abortion weren't you want to make go ahead\nOr let's say a young lady than a state where ... is legal and she gets her you know right either done legally\nYoung lady that they were illegal but she gets it done illegally she can be tried for murder for the study and maximize did in another state that it happened to be legal ran a red green direct I I liked states right was it looks like there ought to be\n... that that that's what it looks like\nThat that's exactly what it looks like if a if a state as it goes ghoulish permissive abortion laws well there you are if another state protecting the unborn and the young lady violates that violates that law that Dr violates that laws in whatever is on the books for violating that law would happen\nThat that this is what the founding fathers thoroughly intended is and that's why we're not a of\nA homogenous just America where the United states of America we're living in Florida is supposed to be different than living in Oregon living in Texas supposed to be different\nThan living in Wisconsin with some unless it's some things we share completely constitutional basic rights various properly written federal laws but a whole lot of other things that have to do with the various angles and ins and outs of life are left to the states to govern according to what the wishes are the people who live in those states\nGod Bless her appreciate you Mark Davis ... back in a moment on

relatively Richardson in Plano and they they listen to you almost religiously [noise]\nWell I almost that's good it shows a certain prioritization that I respect well let's let's talk about the concept of respect um\nLet's do a let let's let's meet in the arena of colonizing I graced the good people of town hall this morning with a a treat is that says something I Want to run by you\nSays no longer just a Supreme Court confirmation a cabin on could fail it can be with you could withdraw himself he can be withdrawn and we could just offer up any Coney Barrett are ... and be just fine constitutionally\nBut these people cannot win the fabric of America is is is at risk here ... laws of basic decency basic human conduct basic behavioral norms they're all\nAt at play here and am I being too dramatic\n[noise] I think what you're having is the latest chapter in\nThe saga of an ongoing disease which is our government has grown so powerful so all encompassing so able to bend the power of government to favor one group for people to another that this is just the latest example of how our problem in politics is not too much money\nDemo idea why it's another try and whether we're at our problems too much power POW we are the founders never intended for the Supreme Court to be this powerful to decide things on the national scope with a single vision them off in the five to four vote\nAnd as a result because all the power in my from on some issues especially the hot button social issues is concentrated in the Supreme Court people will do anything to get that power anything and that's what we're seeing in the Kavanaugh case\nWell that that is where we are because legislatures can legislate a chief executives can do executive things and pilots certain programs through presidents are powerful Congress's powerful\nBut they are all I'm amused and they're all about biased by the Supreme Court and and that means that just when their disagreements they win and that's just all there is to it\nOr is it or we mistaken about that\nNow the Supreme Court is are unelected branch and as a result um and the court that for the life tenure or we have term limits on the president we have um\nYou know lectures every two years in the house of representatives every six years in the Senate but on the Supreme Court especially because the it's only nine justices someone gets on the court for life\nOr that can be in a lifetime of your side losing five to four decisions we'd be a whole lot better off if you remember did you know the first but no Supreme Court nominee ever appeared before the Senate Judiciary committee until Nineteen twenty five\nBecause the court wasn't that powerful now and in fact they didn't consistently started appearing until Nineteen fifty five now of course the Supreme Court is so powerful and so invasive in all of these areas of our life we treated like you know World War three whatever it is the frequency\nIt seems like an event horses out of the hard isn't it a ... and I don't I don't see any way that we can ratchet things that in fact I'm thirty seconds on a conversation I had way here's a little name drop that I Do on purpose\nMy friend Tom Jovan ... at the Institute for policy in the nation I Am wearing they're wonderful people and and he and I were having a conversation about as you said this whole thing about court supremacy Supreme Court supremacy if you will is just a mess their their co equal a that term equal ship suffice their co equal it meaning that\nIf the Supreme Court says something okay fine and as a president disagrees with it\nShe can ignore it but then rather than chaos breaking out the public can then figure out whether we like or don't like the\nPresident that ignores the Supreme Court and we can impeach unlike him and there's a certain rough balance to that unlike what we had that you just described which is this all powerful tribunal that just runs our lives on their way\nWell I Know that Abraham Lincoln Andrew Jackson would occasionally talk about ignoring the Supreme Court and the you know those were and they bring in this case the civil war was around\nI Would much prefer the Congress exercise of power it's almost never used which is Congress can pass a law saying the court does not have jurisdiction over this area of our lives\nIn other words we're going to take back the power we created the constitution created the courts the court's powers not in for that we take back some of it we limited jurisdiction\nI'm OK I'm singling now with with ah with with potential a list of making it might be in a\nRare case of the Nineteen sixties you know the Supreme right out of nowhere said Madeline Marie O'Hare is right you can't have a Supreme Court and you can't have a a prayer to a Supreme Being in a I guess today we we couldn't go out for Muslims but perhaps not anyone else given how things are going but you can't have a prayer in public schools\nWell there was a big move in Congress and I think that if the times had been different and liberalism hadn't been renting renting Supreme back then Congress could have said no this is not the court's jurisdiction we take it back so the decision was null and void\n[noise] and that's okay that's satisfying up to a point because I saw Madeline Marie O'Hare to be as repugnant a person\nA but but we couldn't someone rightfully step forward and say a ... of ... doesn't pass the first amendment when kennel legislature come in there and say you can argue all day whether prayer in school is a First Amendment establishment clause violation or whatever but it doesn't it seats kind of envy argument before it begins\nWell\nAh what the what the court had said in the ... case was this was a ... this was a violation of the establishment of religion claws well if you disagree with that Congress can step in as the people's representatives and say no we have a different view\nAbout again that hasn't happened it's not likely to happen but I'm simply saying that we're going to have to appoint a whole bunch more constitutional is people who were judicial\nRestraint people to the court because you know there are five people on the court if Kavanaugh is confirmed who don't have this expansive view of the Supreme Court's power we have a more humble view\nAnd I think that that's the best way to handle this put people on the court who don't want to be played comic rulers of the rest of us\nPrecisely and and that is why a distance he would be the fifth that's why the left is is having a whole you know one set of on there and\nThat's what's great about talking to Jon son is as we can go very macro and now let's come back and go very micro or I Am feeling a little better about Susan Collins

pathology that led him to go thumbs down on Obamacare repeal way why wouldn't ingest laying how\nWell because there can be there you know diseases don't always take their full course sometimes they

it\nIn and around and no and no one no one is going to care what they are going to care about is what the ideas that Jeff Flake or a John Case it would bring to a presidential race I think they would have strong appeal for Trump haters\nThey have strong appeal for people for whom the president's conservative governance is a little too spicy the sort of the center right the moderate issue voter

taken advantage of it the chair with a question\nAnd if if you want to just hang in my world a little bit on your free time Twitter is ... Mark Davis a radio station is six sixty a and the answer dot com you see what I'm bladder and about on my own time here in the morning show that I Do and if it occurs to you hey has this guy written a book holy cow I guess I have\nA couple of them in fact it was on another technique me about it and out of there was one in twenty fourteen the good people that read Noreen how which we now own which is funny I I wrote a book for regular human Salem Media group ... so that's a good book deal to have a\nLittle thing called Lone Star America out taxes can save our country the idea we're all in the uh the purgatory it'd be Obama years and the ... and my thought was\nHey if if the entire country was run more like taxes we'd be a lot better off and you know what lately looks like we're kind of doing that so that proved that won't say prophetic could just hopefully with sensible that's Lone Star America from twenty fourteenth then in twenty six team in the election year\nIt occurred to me to do about a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty some talk show topics of of subjects that the left has been getting away with like guns are bad\nOr human productivity has definitely warming the planet the constitution is a shape bubble malleable living breathing document and other nonsense and and just a way chapter by chapter to shed Lee okay maybe not so gently but at least civil Lee and constructively push back against that\nAnd I put it together in a little thing called upside down how the left turn right into wrong truth and allies in good and bad\nThat's a lot of subtitle just to Mark Davis upside down on a noodle or Amazon or Barnes and noble or whatever and there's a book and I hope you enjoy\nIt so the last gentleman\nWho took it will all together was talking about how about about Supreme Court justices and boy you could say we've been talking about Supreme Court justice is a lot lately\nI'm at and how it's so important and powerful because it's a lifetime appointment\nAnd the gentleman said it's not a lifetime appointment as a yes\nIt is but I kinda got his point articles research on judicial branch judicial power judicial hours it's easy for you to say\nI'm the judges of the Supreme and inferior records show hold their offices during good behavior\nSo I don't really know what he was getting it if it seems like there were things that were offenses that a lot like maybe deciding wrongly in roe v Wade should have gotten a few justices just tossed out onto the curb okay I'm\nIn a lifetime appointment a barring impeachment and and that gets ... eat so about ... what led to do here is ... there there are two things that people have talked about term limits and age limits\nThe get the more\nUnfair age limits scenes [laughter] 'cause I'm sixty and I'd like to think I'll be around for a couple of do three more decades and uh and I I Know a ton of people\nWho are sharp attacks smart as a whip strong as an ox eighty five I also do some people who are forty court total idiots so I'm just seeing the wildly arbitrary no term limits\nTerm limits boil down to one say turn over for the sake of turnover I think the founding fathers envisioned a I'm a citizen legislature but you know uh\nThey didn't put term limits in there I guess they left that up to us what we finally did it uh for the presidency after FDR was president for thirty seven years [laughter] I Know in a\nIn a bit of twelve or Thirteen but we didn't we did that and I guess\n... we did that I think we're probably all aboard for presidential term limits turnover for the sake of turnover especially these days seems like a good idea\nUh everybody talks about term limits in Congress oh well I can fill up blondes right now everybody just banging the table for term limits here's the dirty little secret you're already\nNot enough people ... oh you do I do\nYour friends do the people you hang out with do I can fill you know forty seven hours of talk shows that people who do\nYou know what if everybody was so good data about term limits we'd had him a long time ago so here ultimately has the bottom line is already the dirty little secret we liked the idea of term limits\nIt sounds great but then when you realize that that means you got to get rid of your congressman just to be under twelve years and it's usually the deal is six\nTerms in the house two terms in the Senate both equally twelve years but that means you you know what that means I mean I got to get rid of Ted Cruz after one more term I don't want to get rid of that grows ever more and more term I Would I Want to I Want I Want to cruise to be a senator Jill you're Ninety three\nSo that's why I term limits never goes anywhere is a big ... and it shows in the polling approval ratings of Congress are terrible for approval ratings of people talking about their congressmen tend to be pretty good so\nEverybody else should have to get rid of their cars and you don't want to get
