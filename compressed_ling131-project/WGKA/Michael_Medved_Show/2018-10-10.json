middle ages it's worse than the nineteenth century\nOr women are basically being persecuted and ground down and ruin and that's why the great appeal of The Handmaid's tale and a bunch of\nOther stories about how men are trying to obliterate women\nReally or we will we will get to that on the Michael method show also talked to Bobby Jindal one of my favorite commentators and one of my favorite former politicians uh Bobby Jindal former governor of Louisiana former star of the Republican House of representatives\nAbout why beyond this election we desperately need a sane Democratic Party we do\nI even assuming Republicans manage to hold the house and hold the Senate it doesn't do any good for the country when the other side is just completely off the rails\nAnd and bizarre we will get to that was governor Jindal and I also want to speak to you about the proposition of revolution and the civil war their voices on the left and on the right\nTo say we're in the midst of a civil war\nOr a cold civil war and may not be actual bloodshed\nBut when you have people ranging from Carl Bernstein to on the left\nAnd Thomas Friedman the New York times on the left\nTo people like Victor Davis Hanson on the right and they're all saying yup civil war is here we're on the verge of fighting here is ah what Carl Bernstein had to say on CNN about why he believes were in the midst of a civil war listen\nBut I think one thing we need to understand is larger context of all of this and that is that we are in a cold civil war in this country a than these two events\nAre both of our investigation and the Kavanaugh nomination\nAre almost a the the Gettysburg and anti the absolutely essential battles of this cold civil war in both the Democrats and the Republicans unfortunately we are only understand that and are exploiting their\nUh instead of having two parties committed to finding out the truth in these two important matters we are now into serious tribalism ear\nO. J. Gettysburg and anti them Gettysburg over the three day battle there were over fifty thousand casualties I mean fifty thousand or anti them\nBloody is single day in American history there are twenty five thousand casualties in a single days battle and by the way both of those battles for people who know your civil war history and I know a bunch of you to do both of those battles resulted in the union successfully\nTurning back an invasion by Robert The late Robert de Leon the sounds in the army of northern Virginia had invaded uh Maryland and we're headed toward Philadelphia and maybe Washington DC\nIn the Eighteen sixties who in September of Eighteen sixty to win and heat them occurred the union stopped them ... by the way a that's part of the story in my book the American miracle and the battle of Gettysburg July of Eighteen sixty three\nOr just a less than a year later another invasion of the north this time of Pennsylvania by Robert Daly in the army of northern Virginia and again the confederates were turned back okay here's my question in today's civil war\nIf you think we're in the midst of one who's invading who wears the invasion occurring because see that's what you had to do it Gettysburg and emptied them he had to turn back the other side\nThey were attacking your territory where is that happening in the United states right now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number is ... stuff to me and and again it it it represents\nBoth sides I'm very glad and I want to pose this to our to our website over at National Review\nThere is a very useful piece by Jake cost who explains why Alexander Hamilton\nCould be the best source\nOf why we are not in the midst of some kind of civil war and now look\nOne of the points that Victor Davis Hanson makes and and a V. D. H. who is a a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford and who have been privileged to me and I'm very glad he's been a guest on this show he's a brilliant historian\nAnd the one pulling that he makes that I think is worth considering is that the reason he believes we are headed toward real civil war in this country is because unlike previous eras in which there were very very grave divides in the United states I just saw this new movie called first man\nWould show with rock star break Tomlin we went out and and saw that film last night and it's a terrific film ... will be reviewing coming up but the the the point about that era of the Nineteen sixties and all of the terrible divisions that\nThat wrecked the country and there was actual bloodshed and riots and destruction and all of that\nBut it wasn't geographical it wasn't so clearly delineated no there was one of the things that the civil war people say is that California should secede\nOr by the way they're a ton of people who don't live in California who would say bravo go for it or send California with us thirty eight million people and uh\nLet them go elsewhere by the way here's an interesting thing and I would just we're just having this discussion over the weekend it at our Sabbath table which is that if you look at the numbers\nWithout California not only the Trump when a genuine electoral college landslide\nBut Trump would actually won the popular vote by over a million and a half\nHillary's three million vote margin\nWas provided entirely by California and it's just California is different from the rest of the country didn't used to be it is now a and and by the way it part of the ideas different states seceding Massachusetts in New York maybe to a note Connecticut not yet but\nUh okay so you have a non continues country or they can all be independent countries there's a new revival up in Canada because of the true though administration of people calling for Quebec to be a separate country so why not\nLook I'm not serious about that and for the same reasons that Alexander Hamilton what arguing federalist number live in a number twelve\nHamilton says we are by nature one country because we're financially integrated with one another we're making money on one another we are not separated\nA in a meaningful way we're we're going to make war on one another because we're all financially and injure locked we we had a story like that yesterday\nWhere there was a bar here in Seattle cultural cheese and a group of college Republicans over at the University of Washington had said they wanted to celebrate the victory for Brett Kavanaugh by staging of beers with Brett party at this uh at this particular bar\nAnd the bar responded to those plans by posting something on their website saying we try to be totally non political we don't want to be involved in politics at all and therefore are the people who want to stage eight beers with Brett or for Brett party or not really welcome\nOkay there was talk that they were going to sue the bar\n'cause you can't discriminate in the city of Seattle based upon political point of view\nAnd a cooler heads prevail and instead of suing they just went in and had their celebration they weren't thrown out\nTheir money was still good or they didn't insist on everybody putting on a magnet half they didn't insist upon a heck during are bothering the other clients they had their party and maybe there are some other people who are literally crying in their beer about Kavanaugh's confirmation is fine\nBut meanwhile the reasons ... did not make a federal case over this was because they wanted to make some money that's a very good motivation now you could ask and this is a very profound question\nSo what happened with the civil war\nWhy was it that the cells in the north were financially integrated the answers they weren't that financially integrated\nThe sounds had a completely different economic system in the south nearly half the labor force were slaves\nAnd everything in the south in terms of criminal law in terms of religion in terms of politics in terms of the economy was based on defending the institution of slavery\nAnd that was the brutal reality it was profoundly different in a way that California I'm Sorry is not that different from Texas\nIf you disagree and you think we are in the midst of a civil war well I'll I'll give you some citations from people who agree with you and we can talk about it there are also one of the characters who is a civil war it was rather against brother well right now there's a congressional race\nWhere his brother against brother and sister [noise] will tell you about it and more coming up on that show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nThat that had a like a facade of all your ... hour a look out and not ... by ... power\nOkay and you'll give me can you give me one indication I understand what you're trying to say Melvin I Do but let me ask you this can you think of one law that either a justice Kavanaugh is going to shore up\nOr a law that he's going to strike down where he is going to act to keep power concentrated for white males which which laws are you most concerned about their\nOr what I signed a law start with you there don't act like a ...\nWell that's that's the that's the fourteenth amendment to the constitution and that's where the fourteenth amendment the constitution guarantees every citizen regardless of color or national origin regard them equal protection of the law right and\nGo ahead [laughter] couldn't that lead to a small part of it either Rick how are you going to get on our watch\nYeah but when you know what what laws do you think right now concentrate power in the hands of white males\nAnd you name one\nBecause that would be unconstitutional up\nA dialogue regarding what women's rights\nThat then it's been in the last since Nineteen sixty three right but that's not being put me in the ... of course it is of course it is if I Know I look Melvin if I dared\nTo uh offer a different salary for someone\nBased on his or gender alone\nOr I Would be struck with a lawsuit so fast and they have lawsuits like this all the time but the the point is and this doesn't mean that there are cases where sometimes people are opposed to hiring then by the way\nThere are cases where people are a whole post hiring men and somewhere they're opposed hiring women but the idea that that this gender gap\nIn terms of pay is because of discrimination it has been answered so many times Lenny suggest you\nGo to the website of Christina hot summers are a woman by the way who's written about this so persuasively and and the idea that right now this is a problem for our world will get into that a little bit more close to two thirds of all graduates of four year colleges and universities in America are female and uh\nI I suspect that by the time my granddaughter is Twenty one right which is a little while but by that time women will be earning more than men on average it'll happen uh we'll be right back on the ... that show civil war or not [noise]\nMichael ...

...\nWith some of the divides within families and we're we'll talk about a little bit later this hour about a particularly spectacular divide with a political family out in Arizona\nI Will get to that and just a moment but um in in National Review Victor Davis Hanson a writes how when and why has the United states now arrived at the brink of a veritable civil war\nAlmost every political\nCultural and social institution universities the public schools the NFL the Oscars the Tonys the Grammys late night TV public restaurants coffee shops movies TV stand up comedy\nHas been not just politicized but also weaponized Donald Trump's election was not so much a catalyst for the divide as a manifestation an amplification of the existing schism\nWe are now nearing the point comparable Eighteen sixty and perhaps past eight Nineteen sixty eight left right factional isn't as increasingly fueled by geography always histories force multiplier of civil strife\nRed and blue states ensure that low Cal magnifies differences that were mostly manageable during the administration to Ford Carter Reagan the bushes and Clinton\nUh again or they they were going to have a ballot initiative on the ballot in California dividing that state\nInto three different states which would be the\nWorst nightmare than than before even because they have three California's not just one\nOkay um\nBut the thing is the the initiative didn't\nQualify for the ballot was ruled off the ballot by the courts in California\nAt seriously it is very very\nSmall numbers of people who actually in California one to succeed even with Trump is president\nAnd it is not true that Governor Perry said the Texans should secede when Obama was present\nOn this issue of a civil war going on\nOne of the things that people said about the civil war and it was literally true it it was brother against brother\nMary Lincoln the first lady of the land wife of Abraham Lincoln had a brother who was in the Confederate Army\nIt was a real division she was from Kentucky and ah in Kentucky particularly that that was a ... to Kentucky to not officially leaves the union but there were a lot of Kentucky Confederate who personally did\nIn any event that idea of family division has been highlighted in this crazy situation involving Congressman Paul ghosts are of Arizona and his opponent whose name is Brill\nI just took out an ad\nThat features six ... six of congressman go SARS nine siblings he comes from a big family and the six siblings basically attack their brother\nAnd not because he's a bad guy not because he cheated them not because it was a person of low morality but because he is an outspoken conservative here's the ad a that was posted by congressman goes our own it\nAll goes for the congressman isn't doing anything to help rural America poles absolutely not working for his district if they care about health care\nThey care about their children's health care they would hold them to account if they care about jobs they hold him to account if he actually cared about people in rural Arizona\nI bet he'd they fighting for Social Security for better access to health care I better he I bet he would be searching what is the most and fight for water policy to help\nThe environment of Arizona's sustain itself and be successful thinks it is not\nListening to you and he doesn't have your interests at heart\nMy name is

approve this message okay I don't approve this message\nI mean honestly I'm now a pogo SARS said\nLook they have a big family that some political disagreements but he doesn't not get along with these folks here is the way that they reported congressman goes ours response on ABC TV\nGoes or fire back on Twitter saying not one of my siblings lives in Arizona the call them disgruntled Hillary supporters you can't pick your family does are treated to the six angry democratic voters see with mom and dad's house\nTheir mother weighing in telling the New York times or congressman son has done a hell of a job for Arizona and they love him goes or responded I guess I really am mom's favorite\nOkay apparently they all get together for Thanksgiving and mom and dad's house now all tense yeah it

in other words just to give people a flavor what you're saying\nYou were Democrats Democrats you write can support gay marriage without forcing small business owners to violate their religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremonies they can defend abortion\nWithout opposing the sorts of restrictions common in Europe including waiting periods and bans on midterm abortions they can fight global warming without making obsolete\nMany Americans livelihoods in lifestyle if all of that is possible why do you think the Democratic party seems to be moving in the other direction\nOr Michael I think this is really an important moment for the Democratic party and they have to decide are they going to listen to the most\nExtreme base or are they going to try to become and remain a mainstream political party in the United states and I look at My Lai list those and other policy positions that they're certainly not going to appeal to conservative Republicans like me and I suspect many of your listeners I\nThink by by trying to come to the middle of the Democratic party can actually\nRecapture some of those voters who voted for Trump who are consistent traditional Republican voters or they can make the decision they want to become angrier and even more radicalized and\nThey look they really have a choice if they pursue things like trying to impeach President Trump or trying to each Brett Kavanaugh insist on open borders they insist on abolishing ice or Medicare for all\nThose are great talking points on that excites their base and they can raise a lot of money from George Soros and folks like that\nBut I don't think they're going to win a lot of elections I think that if anything there to help the President Trump wins reelection I think the worst thing they can do is to continue to go to the far left but I think they've got a choice to make do they want to come back in the middle or they want to continue to be the angry far left party\n... one of those things and I heard this a a theory from a friend of mine is a long time activist in in Republican affairs he has a theory that what the Democrats are trying to do is to go so far to the less\nThan a there has to be set up a middle parties somewhere that would run some kind of quote bipartisan take it\nAnd uh they feel that that that kind of middle party with a celebrity taking the middle was take enough votes away from President Trump to ah to to give Democrats victories in two thousand twenty what do you think\nI I think that if they decided that their plan President Trump didn't start measuring the drapes already I mean you might as well plan on being an office for another six years the reality is\nThere there's at least thirty five forty percent of voters they're going to stick with President Trump to matter what he has shown that time and time again he had those voters in the primary against running against several Republican candidates he had those voters through his highs and lows was campaigning against Hillary Clinton any that voters drives entire two years\nThe reality is look the Democratic party should stop focusing obsessing with President Trump for the Republican Party they should come up with a real solutions to the problems that are concerning the American people if they continue to go to extremes\nYou know the problem that the Democratic party has right now is that they're trying they're trying to persuade anybody they're simply trying to fight and motivate the most liberal members of their base\nAnd they practically given up on the middle class the working class voters that\nSo famously went for President Trump now these are not always reliable Republican voters Republican Party cannot get complacent\nWe don't own these voters they're not going to be loyal voters but they will vote for President Trump and they will vote for Republican officeholders as long as they continue to deliver so as long as you got to cut taxes and cut regulations they use then when he promised the move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem is\nStanding with Israel and the international stage is defending their Second Amendment rights is defending the religious liberty rights he's pointing conservative judges\nSo you know these are the voters that will go and follow and vote for leaders that are actually going to do what they promised that we're going to do\nPresident Trump is done that if the Democratic party really wants to win back these blue collar voters many of them are union voters and many of them living in the heartland in between those two cos if they really want to get back to those voters\nThey've got to stop the the crazy rhetoric they've got to stop the extreme policies I'm not optimistic they'll do that but I I wanted to leave lay out the choice that the party faces\nYou can already see the Democratic candidates they're gearing up to run for president twenty twenty they're already trying to run their their competing to see who can go further to the left and their policy positions are becoming even more radical but one simple example you listed as few as examples\nThey can be promote the couple of them that doesn't mean they have to reject faith or traditional values from the public square or\nPatriotism for that matter ...\nRight that they've almost made it into a ... for some reason the Democratic party thinks it's a winning issue to put down that the American flag or or put down patriotism are being proud of being an American and I just don't think that's a winning formula to be being a majority party in this country\nBy the way that's one of the reasons I think is so important that Ted Cruz wins this race in Texas because ... is really best the entire farm on his support of a kneeling during the national anthem for pro football players\nAnd again that this whole idea that we can have American ... and uh I mean you're you're a child of immigrants and my mother was an immigrant to this country\nAnd uh one of the things that's great about most immigrant families is patriotism love of country loving America but the Democrats by running against that\nUh it it's it's a disaster let me give you a challenge governor Jindal which is that\nWhat you write about the Democratic party I Know a lot of our critics there are a lot of people on the left to say it's even more true about the Republican Party they've gone so far to the right they've lost the mental they've given up on the middle or what do you say to people like that\nWell look I think a couple of days I think both parties are absolutely guilty of thinking they're permanent majorities\nAnd I hate us and the column and the reality of the voter always have to remind them unfortunately if you think about the middle east everybody remembers who hurt them yesterday and they would they want to get their avenge tomorrow and in both parties are certainly guilty of that\nBut just look at the Kavanaugh hearings as a great counter example look\nBrett Kavanaugh was not the most conservative justice that the president could have nominated he he's a fairly moderate establishment figure a Republican now a not a moderate ... between the two parties Yale Law graduate yell undergraduate or graduate you know it was a very good schools worked in the Bush administration\nAnd even before the allegations came out against them you looked at the Democratic history on exist that extreme reaction and I think what you see it as you see this extreme overreaction from the left\nI Would argue that looks certainly there are folks in both parties that that go to extremes but I think when you look at what the president is actually done in terms of cutting taxes cutting regulation in terms of the growth we're seeing the American economy\nThis is what a majority of the American people want it you know the the reason he won election and this is a very important point he didn't say one thing get elected and do something else\nEverything that drives the Democrats crazy about President Trump he absolutely promised on the election trail he was going to do these things and that's why he won the reality is it's not that voters are are you know it's not that Trump voters are disappointed in him or what he has done\nThey're actually getting what he promised them on the campaign trail so but I I think the Democratic party has got a fundamental choice\nI think part of the problem is that when you look at the activist base you look at the donor base they will punish Democrats don't want to compromise you know look at the Democratic party already made up their minds and cabinet before the hearing started they they tore person on that committee and almost every one of the months ago came out and said they were going to oppose them\n... and I think they're trying to appeal to the most liberal donors most liberal activists\nWhat they forget that was that's not where most American voters are most American voters don't want to abolish ice most American voter\nDon't think that the police are across the board you know out there trying to hurt innocent people most American voters want to stand for the ... the American flag and most American voters are to your point patriots I'm reminded when asked President Obama about you know he did he think America was accept Sean and remember that kind of wishy washy Andrea\nHe said yes we're exceptional the same way that Greeks thing Greece's exceptional and Brits think Britain as a as a exceptional in other words we're not a but I'll tell you is exceptional ebbs Bobby Jindal his piece Democrats trying some self restraint\nJust appeared in the wall Street Journal and it's terrific a governor I Know you have to run we will look forward to talking to you next time and we will be right back on self restraint and politics on the men that show with your calls [noise]\nIt always fascinates me when people are able to come to the root themselves I mean the right\nYou across the right has been in this place for many many years but one of the ... that ... that comes on frequently during your show in Houston they talked about war it's all about we're in a war and so and if ... if you're listening to talk radio\nCalls do we talking about how the war we're having with the ...\nI I think as as you know I I agree with you that does happen and I think it's unfortunate and I don't think you will hear that rhetoric on this show because I think it's wrong I don't think this is a war and I'll tell you why David and I've said this many times of the goal of a war is to destroy the enemy\nTo kill him basically and uh the the goal of politics is to persuade people\nMichael is this your friends who say it is so don't know I'm a yeah OK you particularly don't see it but if you're friends through for people who you are\nOkay you know what I you probably have some friends who have some strange ideas to write\nThis strange [laughter] wait a minute wait a minute what about ... or ...\nOr not my prayer and I'll probably vote for him but he's not a friend of mine\nOkay we'll do vote for him a because again if you do that you're encouraging this left were drift of the Democratic party David ... I'd like to sit down I imagine that you and I would find a lot that we would agree on and by the way I Do agree with your basic point that's why I went to your call first\nIs because I think it is true that this tendency also exists on the Republican side but I'll tell you it was very refreshing to me I think it's one of the most important speeches in recent years when Susan Collins spoke on the Senate floor every word she said about a justice Kavanaugh\nWas measured it was balanced it was persuasive it was none of this rhetoric is the other side is all wrong and we're All right\nAnd this is the basic point because even if you leave out the independent voters the people who vote regularly and they go back and forth to Republicans and Democrats\nThe biggest group of prospective voters in America that people don't vote an aunt who aren't interested the people who represent this uh\nDaniel Tosh who are dumb as blank and don't vote and don't pay attention to try to get people to pay attention\nIt it doesn't work to say that we're on the verge of Armageddon and and we're all getting ready to\nKill each other when it actually works better it seems to me St Louis we have some good ideas about how we can change things for the better and in the midst of a big down day on Wall street today in a horrible horrible hurricane about the strike the panhandle in Florida [noise]\nMaybe we can remember that we all have bigger obstacles and enemies than\n[noise]\nTwenty theater\n[noise] with us\nOr a news eyeball I view in Washington hurricane Michael has blow to shore in the Florida Panhandle with wins initially lease of about one hundred fifty five miles with our\nPresident Trump says it's been difficult because everybody who needs that evacuated in advance of hurricane Michael you says he is working closely with the ... and before the governor's office to make sure the people who need help get it in the aftermath of the storm preparations underway and several nearby states as well including as far north as\nNorth Carolina and across the state of Georgia\nStory day on Wall street the Dell joined us for leverage plunging more than eight hundred points its worst drop at eight months went by sharp requires a technology stocks\n... have been drawing investors out of the stock market and the best performing stalks over the past year took some of the biggest losses today Amazon was around six point two percent of its value Netflix gave back eight point four percent this is Sri new\nNine twenty answer traffic\n... nothing I think we've that delayed backing up proceeding brings ... reading more than from ... done what he planning do your favorite take Roswell round ... something you're there and that can help me get away from some of that\nCash in the other troubled by he's going to be on the downtown ... there were scenes in the late ... gotten worse than the ... do you travel advisories yard with a\nCrash involving injuries and this is probably going to take a minute to the earth evolved and got a vehicle that hit the median wrong in the same area but definitely avoid defined as you head out the door from home are worth the DV friendly trafficking in center\nOn Brittany ... hiring ... recruiter unlike most job board zip recruiter find candidates for you and actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates fast super recruiter the smartest way to hire try it for ... recruiter dot com slash join\nThis is Michael ... here with Mike stole from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe cost of many Medicare plans are decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate help markets offers a free service would access to a thousand Medicare plans plans I can eliminate you're out of pocket costs plans with zero dollar premiums and even plan to pay you back\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind with so many new options it can be confusing you can get objective help to find a plan that may cost what's an cover more with lower co pay more choices like dental vision and prescription drug coverage and the freedom to see the doctors and you don't miss out on savings you deserve our health markets Medicare assistance is ...\nThanks my this is Michael med bed for health markets\nFind out if you can get a Medicare plan to pay you back coal in Hungary someone oh nine Ninety nine Thirteen it's eight hundred seven or nine Ninety nine Thirteen eight hundred seven o nine Ninety nine Thirteen\nAnd now I found from Geico motorcycle it took Fifteen minutes to purchase the gas station ...

way up to Fifteen\nThat's what Matt Damon said when he was trying to in a very un funny it seemed to me Saturday Night live skit when he was playing justice Kavanaugh in any event the point is that\nThere are ways to persuade people and to work with them and right now the Democratic party has lost its way entirely I mean just entirely the\nThe strategy that they're using I think is going to help to ensure\nRepublican victories certainly in Senate races and maybe even in holding the house coming up with this election or let's um [noise] let's go to your\nCalls and to Richard in

just uh\nWhat's the war over what what what's the what are we fighting about\nAre we are fighting about whether or not we're going to lead western civilization the way it is\nA who do when you say the way it is a ... do you think of western civilization is perfect right now\nYeah so I prefer west or\nCivil I prefer to but do you think it's perhaps\nNot perfect you know\nHow we also we want western civilization to change and improve the question is do you want it to change or improve or a discarded altogether the number of people who wants to discard western civilization altogether that number is very small it certainly very small among people who run for office or who are in politics in other words if you were to point out\nAnd he is in custody right now now what state am I talking about which one do you think Rhode Island\nNo Minnesota know Alabama\nAbsolutely not no it's Russia [laughter] this is the world of ... and uh these things these images were um posted on V. contact which is um the Russian equivalent of Facebook and this is just\nOne of those things where when people talk about American a civil war the reason they are so sensitive about anything that has anti Christian stuff is because the Russian Orthodox church has become totally involved with the boot and regime and they're very intertwined unfortunately in rush which is a bad thing for the church\nAnd is just one of the other multiple corruptions of\nThe ... regime they have been a they're currently prosecuting four hundred and eleven criminal cases against Internet users in Russia for the imagery that they post\nAnd it can be imagery insulting president poop then it can be imagery insulting religion it can be a imagery that they think is unpatriotic now look I get offended and I will be critical of of various things that you get from Hollywood or popular culture but the idea\nThat that you want to arrest people and put them in prison for stuff that they posted on the Internet unless you're talking about direct threats of violence or involvement with terrorism that stinks\nAnd we also recognize the difference and also recognize how far away from any democratic norm this increasingly nightmarish regime in Russia really is\nLet's go to ah to your calls and to Tom in Los Angeles Tom you're on the Michael ...\nMichael either they're doing well okay I'll say all of your do your about your ... interesting you're saying\nWell thank you trying to be\nAll anyway uh it was very glad you told your screener I was just wondering where we are spending so much crime or evaluating and trying to help the Democratic party pointing up of things that they're doing wrong and why do we just let them bring themselves to the ground and start over again\nWhite you know basically the only thing themselves a Democrat thing we'll we'll go here [noise]\nThey should like ... they should be and I'll I'll tell you why so that we can get some I told you so rights when they end up losing their dream of taking over the house because if they take over the house this way with this kind of\nPolitical appeal it'll be incredibly bad for the country or I mean you could say well it will ensure that President Trump gets re elected 'em because the Democrats will be so so hateful but then we have two years to go through and there's no telling what kind of security damage what kind of damage\nIn terms of protecting Americans in terms of border security in terms of our defense posture foreign policy\nThey can do all kinds of damage plus we have a gigantic problem and this is where we need Democrats there's not even to about the budget deficits in about the national debt without bipartisan action\nThat's why President Obama miss such a golden opportunity with the Simpson Bowles commission during his administration we can't fall into that same trap appreciate your call let's go to Mike in Minneapolis Mike you're on the ... that show\nI like within um I'm a retired intelligence officer I spent most of my career studying guerrilla war and I would disagree with you this country is is not in a civil war but it isn't a guerilla war or say antifa or in in a\nUh Berkeley who actually conducted violence to stop speech and held it better that said this war and I will say the resistance movement which has added in the legitimacy of its government Michael that's the definition of a guerilla war military terminology\nOkay wait wait wait a smaller people I'm Sorry\nI'm Sorry it is not ... ... we're equating two things the resistance movement where they have hundreds of thousands of people out in Washington the day after Trump got an R. Rated I made fun of it\nI think it's ridiculous however to equate that with people and anti five were actually attacking property and fighting with people and really are violent radicals is a number of on the farm people is so minuscule and we should not fall into the trap\nOf exaggerating the power of a fringe\nGroup or by the by the way we should be very directed by this is similar\nTo what the left does when they talk\nAbout some crazy Nazis in Charlottesville is representative of the right we'll be right back on them eventually [noise]\nAm nine twenty\nTheater [noise]\nWith blinds dot com getting your home holiday ready doesn't have to mean taking up a second mortgage brand new made to order custom lines from blindsided calm\nWill give your home and instant upgrade just in time to impress everybody over the holidays\nThe team at ... dot com walks you through the entire measure and installation process you've been even send them photos to help guide their recommendations and they'll answer questions via phone email or live chat plus you can read reviews the before and after photos and get the latest trends and colors and patterns at\nTheir website with over Twenty years in business over twenty million blindfold blindsided comes the number one online retailer of custom window coverings for a reason they're simply the best order now through October sixteen and you can save up to thirty percent plus take an additional five percent all cite wide with a promo about med bed\nThat's up to thirty percent plus an additional five percent off site why the blind side palm promo bowed med rules and restrictions apply\nOr you know what I Want to answer\nThere's er an athlete and trying to think I came in ... in the right lane of our perimeter cleaning up the breed from an earlier ... he found that in early ... at the different highway now where the anthem ingestion hear your accent thirty peanut causing the lights on and on from Georgia bar high brand\nAnother Iraq on the tap tiny thing clearly it with logging he laugh lines that will have any time now found out that he lady find that accent you thirty eight and with the the rain and the theory in Clayton County housing and congestion on healing I get that will get a check on that poor cat from the traffic command center I'm Brittany climb Peter\nDo you feel tired after a full night's sleep do you wake up with a headache or dry mouth\nDon't you're sleeping border complain about your ... or see what you stop breathing while you sleep if you said yes you should be screened for sleep apnea and they'll do I need better sleep Doug gum\nYou can get tested for sleep apnea quickly and affordably right in the comfort of your own home for a free questionnaires ... sleep apnea just goes right for you call now one eight hundred five or nine fourteen thirty five there's convenient home just get requires no drive away from work it's confidential position reviewed and could save you hundreds of dollars compared to inconvenient laboratory sleep just this\nIs the easiest most convenient affordable way to get tested for sleep apnea from industry leaders and sleep therapy\nCall I Need better sleep Doug gone for a free questionnaire does he have a sleep apnea just goes right for you for your free questionnaire goal one eight hundred five or nine fourteen thirty five that's one eight hundred five or nine fourteen thirty five not available to Medicare Medicaid or any other government insurance recipients\nI taught to answer whether\nBacklash from hurricane Michael ... percent chance of showers and thunder storm type nearing eighty one later on tonight a hundred percent chance of rain expecting heavier wins out their lives in the seventies from the center and pee on a boat you know\nLive from the AM nine twenty the answer studios in bucket it's eighty two degrees of\nOne more day of nine point Anton though you got to tell me download our mobile apps\nContests promotions on demand higher\nYour smartphone free download the either tore Android apps\nMichael Moore vigil or one of them are Michael methods marvelous Maliki making media\nMachine ... Michael ...\nLiving any something very clear about something I just said in response\nTo a caller uh I Do not believe that there is a significant presence of Nazis or Ku Klux klansmen or people of that nature on the American right\nAnd I believe you probably can find more crazy anti American Left is at least somewhat more uh who are present on the American left\nIn other words I I think that ... at the moment is more of a threat to the American political system and certainly to our educational system in our university system then is the American Nazi Party or white supremacists or area nations or any of those people however\nThe same principle of pains it is completely unfair and unjustified\nFor people to regularly tried to associate Republicans with some of those creeps in Charlottesville who were marching around um ... carrying torches and with Nazi paraphernalia Nazi symbols\nAnd uh that's not representative of the mainstream the conservative movement\nIs also completely untrue that these thugs where black ski masks and smash windows and beat people up who recently were by the way attacking motorists in Portland to\nAnd then boom we're an election day [noise]\nAnd it is very very clear how the Democrats plan on winning everything winning the Senate winning the house winning governorships they plan to do it by scaring\nThe heck out of women\nBy basically suggesting that if you\nReelect Republican majorities in the house and in the Senate then combined with the Trump Administration there will be a nightmare crack down on female rights by the way if you think this is a either a good political strategy or that there's even a little corner of this that is true\nOr you can give me a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nWhat is the ... to me is that since President Trump was elected which is going on two years ago really going on two years ago and in those two years\nThe hysteria about the loss of women rights of women being forced back into the kitchen and when and being forced back into chains of women no longer owning their bodies\nOf basic women's dignity and life being taken away it's all gotten so far out of control I mentioned before\nOn the show in fact I mentioned several times but now there's there's all kinds of new evidence that I find very very amusing I'd mentioned\nThat the tendency for\nThese nightmare visions of a sexist future a patriarchal future with all women rights race and that's the popularity of The Handmaid's tale him instead was written in Nineteen eighty five where conservatives really were riding high I mean Reagan had just gotten elected\nA and reelected reelected with forty nine of fifty states so Margaret Atwood writes this idiotic book and it says it's a little lame book it's lousy it's not even good to read as fiction but the division of the book of course as people know now because of the great success of the TV series\nIs that the Christian right has taken over a country that used to be America is now closed gilly ad and basically has taken away all the rights to women women are now property they basically now are owned by men and owned by the government\nAnd okay that was bad enough in Nineteen eighty five what sense does that make\nIn two thousand and Eighteen well the point is\nThe Handmaid's tale is only the beginning there's another book that I hold your attention to a\nCold Vioxx which is a a book basically that suggests that in the future\nOf women are are going to\nBe forced to be docile forced to be obedient and not allowed to talk\nThey're fitted by a dictatorial government with little bracelets that administer increasingly severe electric shocks\nIf those women dare to speak more than a hundred words at a time uh-huh why why are people reading this stuff okay\nWe got my intention was this morning and the New York times there's actually an excellent piece by Alexandra alter but I I don't think she wrote a tongue in cheek\nBut she could have\nShe starts out by this way by by talking about the situation in a new\nPopular novel it's supposed to be a classic right\nOn a desolate island three sisters have been raised in isolation sequestered from an outbreak that's causing women to fall ill\nTo protect themselves from toxins which men can transmit to women the sisters undergo cleansing rituals that include simulated drowning\nDrinking salt water and exposing themselves to extreme heat and gold above all they are taught\nTo avoid all contact with men always a good lesson\nTo uh our wives and daughters right\nThe water cure which comes out in the United states in a couple of weeks was long listed off course for the man Booker Prize and joins a growing wave a female centered\nScience fiction futuristic\nWorks that raise unfortunate questions uncomfortable questions about pervasive gender inequality massage any hatred of women and violence against women the erosion of reproductive rights and the extreme consequences of institutionalized sexism\nThe author of the water cure whose name is Sophie Macintosh she looks like she's about fourteen years old by the way\nShe lives in London she says I felt like I didn't need to invent a disaster big cause there was already is\nFaster happening okay\nWhat's that disaster happening right now when really what is it where is it where our women's rights being denied\nMost of these new dystopian stories rights of New York times take place in the future but channel the anger and the anxieties of the present moment when women and men are like are grappling with shifting gender roles and the messy continuing aftermath of the hash tag me too movement\nThey're lending at a charged and polarizing moment when a record number of women are getting involved in politics and running for office well yeah obviously and more women are speaking out against sexual assault and harassment\nAt a time of increase the unease about parity between the sexes both knew one classic dystopian novels seemed to be resonating with leaders and critics\n\nOne new novel by an author named alderman is called the power to twisted feminist revenge fantasy setting a world where women developed the ability to deliver an electric shock\nTo any man who touches them that book is sold hundreds of thousands of copies and is in development as a TV series wonderful\nJust what we need\nAt the same time readers are bracing classics the genre that have taken on a new significance of today's political climate Margaret Atwood's novel The Handmaid's tale sit in the future theocratic state where women are treated as reproductive slaves it's now sold more than three point five million copies in the United states since two thousand\nSeventeen they say it's because of Trump thank you President Trump Margaret Atwood won't say thank you chose it for broad total sales to more than five million and this was adopted\nInto the award winning television series and you see the people dressing and the costumes of The Handmaid's tale all over as part of these protests let me tell you about another one of\nThese books because I think it's kind of amusing\nWhat better way to force somebody into submission than to take away the one thing that makes them human language\nLike The Handmaid's tale several recent dystopian novels explore how women's fertility tend to find her worse than a society's ... eyes and consider what might happen to the government mandates and controls childbearing\nIn her new novel hazards of time travel coming out in November Joyce Carol Oates award winning novelist veteran novelist she's old now but just ... Joyce Carol Oates takes an almost literal approach to exploring fears that the clock could be turned back on women's rights\nThe novel opens in the future autocratic America where students are taught that men have higher I used in with it\nAnd it centers on one young woman who was arrested for treason after she raises questions about the regime in school as punishments she gets teleport it back to Nineteen fifty nine Wisconsin to be re educated and rendered more\nDocile sounds like fun huh I'm\nThe various so many of these there's a Lenny zoom us was struggling to become pregnant when she began writing her recent novel red clocks which takes place in the near future America where abortion and in vitro fertilization or legal and embryos are enshrined with a right to life\nThe idea came to her when she was researching fertility treatments and came across references to propose legislation that would outlaw in vitro fertilization okay there's not going to be legislation that outlaws in vitro fertilization\n... what is it just craziness coming from\nLet's uh\nLet's go to a Linda in North Hollywood, California Linda you're on the ... that show\nHow well I think the Democrats have a winning strategy even now I only get ... and it's because I think women are not right now is she in Athens [laughter]\nLet her\nHow much you're going to them they're just not smart enough you know\nI you know what I I don't think that's true and that's that's why I'm I'm Glad that you call that I'm Glad we're talking about this\nLook [noise] the notion that women's rights are being taken away at a time when there are more women than ever in Congress and running for Congress men and women a bait two thirds of the college degrees are one by women\nIn the or a turtle battle of the sexes women are winning by the way somebody disagrees with that give me a\nCall one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six I also want to talk about\nThat's not going to happen and there there are no politicians that I Know of who believe that that should be the case or let us go to\nA hole in Los Angeles Paul you're on the Michael minute show\nYes I like you know and I don't well I mean given the abortion right the anti abortion\nRenee is not that's not a position for a judge\nThat the bridges and the conservatives are at work you\nKnow conservative politicians are anti abortion without
