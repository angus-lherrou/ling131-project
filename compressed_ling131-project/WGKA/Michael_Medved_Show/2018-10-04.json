Democrats making wild accusations trying to a practice the politics of personal destruction\nTrying for a massive and comprehensive investigations of what the terms blue thing in devil's triangle really meant to high school students in Nineteen eighty two if you believe this is the kind of endeavor\nIn which our representatives in Congress should be engaged Daniel votes the Democrats\nAnd 'cause you'll be getting lots and lots\nAnd lots more of this and they win this thing the owner of the reasons that I think that Republicans have been so unified and so energized by this whole process\nIs because there's an understanding people right now they're not attacking Donald Trump Donald Trump I mean he attacks back and he says things sometimes that are stupid says things sometimes that are not\nTrue but that is not Brett Kavanaugh for goodness sake\nBrett Kavanaugh's entire record is one of mainstream conservatism of judicial excellence of support from people who don't agree with them building coalitions and that's exactly why they're afraid of him on the Supreme Court\nJudge Kavanaugh has a good relationship with Elena Kagan an Obama appointee associate justice of the Supreme Court how do we know because he says so\nShe was the one when she was dean of Harvard law school who appointed Brett Kavanaugh to change their\nAnd if they are going to go after Brett Kavanaugh who does build coalitions who works with other people who has a life long record of impressing people positively men and women and black and white and liberal and conservative if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh and make him into some kind of cartoon villain\nMake him into some kind of serial rapist stumbling drunk I mean none of this is true\nAnd it's the worst kind of politics it's despicable politics and people talk about a threat to democracy this kind of politics is more of a threat to democracy than all of President Trump's stupid tweets combine then there are plenty of stupid tweets and\nThe idea that a President Trump is going to permanently alienate female voters it's it's not true President Trump in the last election won a majority of white female voters truly didn't win is big majorities Romney did\nBuddy won a majority and the the idea that that the Democrats are trying polarization to separate eight women out say ... women have to vote like well then see how that worked for Hillary Clinton\nIt it is the answer is it didn't and I believe that this democratic strategy is divisive\nAnd awful\nAnd ah that the American people are waking up to its dangers and to um to to try to to stop it he hears a disagreeing email that came in from Brian in Compton, California\nAh his message to me is judge cage guilty where there's smoke there's fire you Republicans whitewash everything\nIt's clear as a twenty year investigator for the state which include sexual assault cases rape et cetera I interviewed over thirty plus pick another candidate and your best comment about his demeanor\nCourt versus private that's ridiculous my comment was this\nHe was at the committee as a witness not as a presiding judge there is no\nEvidence at all that as the presiding judge or as if someone functioning in a courtroom capacity he has never shown any problems with his temperament [noise] he's a functioning alcoholic pick somebody else\nHe set himself he is\nBuy us really and you are going to make him a judge long as the bias is for your side it's fine these are the fax cover up and deceit\nNo hearing from Merrick Garland there we go that shows your bias and lack of fairness nothing can beat that\nUm [noise] I again a Merrick Garland good man by the way\nSomebody who's been a good judging will continue to be a good judge on the appellate court we'll be right back disagreement day on that show [noise]\nIt it you know that there is one of the things that is appalling in this country and that we need to continue to make progress on we've made some progress\nIs the high rate of crime against black people but nearly all of that crime nearly all of it or the overwhelming majority and it's over Ninety percent is perpetrated by other black people and that was the reason that I was speaking about that now let me go to your point about judge Kavanaugh\nDo I know that he is telling the truth uh in in terms of his denials about what happened allegedly to Dr Ford I don't know for certain diseases telling the truth but I think the absence of any confirming evidence at all\nIs overwhelming\nAnd the whole way that her accusations against him came out or very suspect\nAnd ... and by the way it is impossible to remove this from a political context and the reason I feel so outraged about judge Kavanaugh is he really did appear to be the ideal nominee I don't know and I've never met him\nBut I Do know people who have worked with him closely and they have the highest regard for him including people who are only a left\nUm al ... who was a guest on this show recently is a professor of law at Yale who has had interaction with the judge Kavanaugh in the classroom and otherwise\nAnd he's a liberal he was very active in the Hillary Clinton campaign he strongly supports judge Kavanaugh's nomination and the notion that he should be blocked from the Supreme Court\nBased on on early unsupported unprecedented accusations against him seems to me a profound wrong because one of the things that you know about\nPeople who are sexual predators real sexual predators and people who commit sexual assault and rape and and uh at end violence against women\nMost of those people do it as a pattern is on a one off\nAnd the idea that the other accusations against a judge Kavanaugh other than a doctor for it are completely non credible and have been clearly denied a that I think is worth taking into consideration of coming up [noise]\nA group of protesters family be women [noise]\nAny urges those women to grow up is that an outrage we'll play the shocking audio and more coming up on disagreement day on the med show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number ...\nSometimes I get so mad as
