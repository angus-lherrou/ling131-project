gotta hit their gap forgot to play some man coverage 'cause that's the only way you can defend some of the stuff that they're doing and\nAnd you you know if Georgia Tech alike in that you got to tackle the running back 'cause a lot of times the balls just at the mess for so long and you don't know if he's got it or not so\nThere's some there there are a real challenge their second in the league until office their second in the league and rushing two hundred and forty seven yards again I'm\nSo we got our hands full and then they got they got one kid that number three door to who is a real play maker or leaves the league and receiving a he he leaves the league in return second and kick return a first an all purpose I mean he's a good football player we'll we'll have our hands full um be a good challenge\nThere only four teams in the country that have at least twelve hundred yards rushing and twelve hundred yards passing already this year two of them are going at it in Winston Salem this weekend Wake Forest\nAnd and and Clemson and I think a lot of people look away for so that runs Sunni place they must throw the ball all over the yard but both of these teams a secret or their success as being able to do both\nYeah no doubt about it that's that's certainly I mean we're we to this point had been to this point this is the most explosive off as we've had yards per ... right and that's kind of kind of slipped under the radar I think the first five games because we've got ahead a little\nWe've had some craziness along the way that we've been incredibly explosive and we have always been as efficient as we need to be a ... because we've been able to run the football so effectively\nWe we have we have been able to create a lot of these explosives and but at the same thing well wait they they're very similar in that regard we're different in how we go about doing things um but we're both kind of getting those type results based on the run game\nYeah and the other thing is you are also on a record pace in terms of yards per Russia's six point five point seven is the existing record also by that two thousand and six team is a little bit about your defense um and the way Wake Forest runs in it so quickly with their place you're going to have any opportunity to substitute during the game\nI don't know yeah you know Syracuse was lightning speed and these guys are ... they're they're really fast but you know you have to we got to pick your spy you got to pick your spots are the good news is is I Do think we have more deaths than they do a so we we gotta find opportunities whenever they do sub ... to to get some subs in their\nUh but the biggest thing is we got to just we've got to create thirty ... we've got to take something away from them that they love to do and it's it's it's it's kind of like playing Georgia Tech and then if you can if you can stop the run and then you have an advantage and not see the same thing in this game we we've got to find a way\nTo keep them in third law situations where it has to be a drop that game for them and then hopefully we can get them all you know get them off the field quick and that was our formula against Syracuse they only had sixty seven place\nAre we really limited than they were three Fifteen on third down so to be a similar approach and and and recipe for success against these
