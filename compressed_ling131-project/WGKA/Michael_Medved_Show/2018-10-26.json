discussion of what that commandment is about in my irrational Bible which is changing laws which is what it's meant to do\nI feel so funny telling you that you should read it because I wrote it and it sounds self serving so I don't know what am I supposed to do any way it is but to change lives really reviews on Amazon I don't have anything to do with those reviews\nOkay let me try to see what I can do here\nInto custody and in solving this mystery of the great bomb scare with fourteen different packages sent to fourteen different people around the country\nGetting that things solved in record time I know I Know I Know it's always tempting to try to jump on the president the United states or to jump on people in the mainstream media or to jump on one party or another party or this one or that one and say boy did you ever get it wrong\nBoy is this terrible boy are you to blame I ah I I Want to try to avoid that\nBecause honestly we have every reason to celebrate as a country and President Trump has been speaking recently\nAbout the need to come together and to see things in harmony and to see things as Americans not as Republicans or Democrats or pro Trump or is there anti Trump or his but basically look at this thing citizens\nAnd when you look at this thing this has been remarkable\nAnd one of the things that I literally just moments before I got on the air here\nI put out a tweet that said look this should remind everybody of how lucky we are\nTo have people in place like yes Jeff Sessions and yes Christopher Wray the head of the FBI and yes all of those extraordinary people who work every single day sometimes putting their lives on the line\nTo keep us safe through the FBI and the rest of law enforcement\nThrough the New York city police the local Florida police we just had a um a moment with Jeff Sessions are announcing the arrest if you haven't heard it and you probably have but Caesar say oc who's fifty six years old\nWho um it at least as far as I can gather has known employment\nAppears to have been living in his van and yes his van is festooned with all kinds of a political\nA bumper stickers and posters it's actually kind of artfully designed\nBut the messages on the van are insane and a despicable and dare I say it's deplorable\nIn any event and he was a arrested today taken into custody he's having multiple charges filed against him\nHe was being interrogated and what they call a national security exemption in other words they can't interrogate him without an attorney present dinner fear I think that what they're trying to do is to determine\nWhether or not he had any accomplices or had any associates and he doesn't appear to a a guy with a very very long criminal history\nA guy who as I mentioned may or may not have been living in his van recently uh before that during another very serious criminal charges in during another bankruptcy that he declared he was living with his mom\nAnd I'm at ... we're not talking about\nAn ... an upstanding or model citizen and when you look at pictures of the van I you know I think about this because my most important role in the world is that right and that's true for probably many many of the males who are listening to me\nAnd I was looking at the pictures of this van with all the messages on it and literally you can see out the windows because the windows are totally covered with top youth soccer recruits for Trump\nDrain the swamp dishonest media CNN sucks I'm hard rock\nWeekly or they have a seminal hard rock weekly now this has led to some confusion I think because people are saying well he may or may not be Native American I think the seminal there is not a reference to the tribe it's a reference to the football team\nOr to the um uh Florida State Seminoles I Believe it is in any are there are also pictures of Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton\nAnd I believe in the Van Jones a with a targets on their faces and that's not good but in any event I ... when I was trying to imagine is think if you have a daughter\nAnd somebody's coming up to pick up your daughter in front of the house and he's driving a van like like ... I mean I'm I Know somebody is is it okay if I say who it is Greg\nEdge do ah who has suggested a that any any time that police spot a van or a car or any kind of people with more than six bumper stickers they ought to investigate it immediately\nIn any event this uh this is a sort of a tip off that's where he was coming from but this is the way Jeff Sessions sounded this morning and and by the way I Hope that this leads to President Trump and all the rest of us\nAppreciating the attorney general a little bit more appropriate here's the attorney general of the United states\nI'm pleased to participate in this announcement that a suspected that the custody of the FBI I Want to remind everyone up to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged tonight\nWith five federal crimes including interstate transportation or an explosive illegal mailing of explosives threats against former presidents and certain other person's threatening interstate communications an of solving current\nAnd former federal officers for these charges a defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nThese charges may a change or expand as the investigation for sees\nThis is the law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political by\nOkay good for him or he's he's exactly right and you don't want the president spoke beautifully this morning no I mean it ah the Twitter feed probably best ignored but\nHis speaking this morning was solid he uh he was speaking to a great group and they were so enthusiastic and he was bonding with him so well it was a moving occasion\nHe was speaking to turning point USA's young black leadership summit and it's it's ironic I just this morning I left Minneapolis I left the hotel this morning at five\nAnd five AM and I wrote to the airport with my friend and colleague Larry Elder who was on his way to precisely this young black leadership summit and a\nHere's what the president's sounded like with the announcement before he began what was a very successful and a fine speech to the people who are attending that summit here's the president the United states\nI like to begin as you are leaders that's a real leaders [noise] I'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that had been male too high profile figures throughout our country band a media organization\nI Am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended to suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise] credible job by law\nFor us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation finds that person or persons responsible for these events\n[noise] these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nI was struck the authorities despair no resources or expense and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice\n[laughter]\nWill prosecute them him her\nExtent of the\nGood for you Mr President and then he went on to say this much never allow\nPolitical violence to take rooted in America\nAnd I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it at\nI've\nJust concluded a briefing with the department of justice following the apprehension of the suspect\nI Want to applaud the FBI Secret Service for the department of justice the U.S attorney's office for the southern district of New York the NYPD federal law enforcement throughout the entire country credible partners these people have worked so hard\nAnd to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate\n[noise] that's\nThe president of the United states and this is a fine moment for President Trump\nAnd I know he didn't ah the death associate the DNA on the saliva on the stamps from the packages with this guy personally but he's in charge you know things went wrong he would get blamed\nIt isn't this something worth celebrating and and what is it on what basis would you attack the Trump Administration\nAre there are real questions about why he was running around out among us and um the point over here is I Would just\nTry to get folks on on the left including I I heard earlier today a congresswoman Jackie Speier who was just way over the top and this is a little reflective of the hatred of President Trump and it's all President Trump has ... can you imagine anyone\nCelebrating if one of these bombs going off\nThink about it and for conservatives and I mean we would feel horrible horrible\nJust as I I Know that when ... was shot and almost killed when there was the would be killer and the congressional baseball practice who fired at Republican members of Congress\nI didn't see anybody on the left celebrating I didn't hear anybody saying oh I Wish he'd kill ...\nAnd and maybe we can think in those terms and let that inform some of our rhetoric\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nI'm let us go to your calls and to a Don in Columbus Don you're on the Michael made that show\nIt's like oh sure I'm I'm at the beginning of your show even argue with making jokes about white right wing nut job is going to bomb if they were the immigrant doing it you would have a totally different spin on it and I heard a caller in your show Colin band that\nBefore the man was a a you arrested that they thought were Democrats all of the Republican\nRight and you learn that I said earlier that as you heard what I said to them and I've also tweeted about it I think it was always ridiculous to assume this was some kind of false flag operation\nUm I don't I I I Do not believe that there is a would be some kind of conspiratorial Democrat who'd be willing to sacrifice himself\nOr in order to try to kill some members of his own party ... none of that makes the least bit of sense so fine done you're right I mean ... but\nFor you to assume do you think that saves are say on this guy represents I'm a big segments of the Republican Party\nYou there no\nOkay well we lost him because he clearly does not I I honestly I I was last night was in Minneapolis with a dentist Prager Larry Elder\nAnd our friend ed ... from hot air and their eight hundred people

I'm not sure that your narrative Diaz exactly the way it happened but you're right there was this situation in California\nWhere there were a bunch of Trump supporters outside of the stadium where he was speaking who were assaulted by demonstrators on the other side and yes this is stupid and there was an attempt I went and Coulter was supposed to be speaking at University of California\nAre they actually did property damage and they rioted and are there is no question that the left has been far more guilty of actual violence trying to shut down free speech then they're right far more guilty of it I've never heard of a case in the last do fifty years\nOf people in the right shutting down any speaker at a college campus\nHappens all the time from the left appreciate your call or let's go quickly to John in Olympia, Washington John you're on the ... that show\nYou know if it's telling how how you're acting right now because if it had been a Democrat scored or do\nA talking heads I Would be this as a of a false flag\nAnd and you mentioned earlier in my mind as you mentioned earlier that Trump spoke and he said he didn't want violent and tear effect to take root in America Trump is reaping what he so he he he is doing nothing but a a that this guy was a a a Trump supporter not bar right weight\nAnd it needs to be excluding like that Mike and you should be ... warmer but it will hold on hold on for a moment it again\nYou're not saying things that are untrue but you're saying things that are disconnected\nIn other words it as Trump's slogan irresponsibly in the past from time to time he does\nBut ... there is no connection at no point to Trump say anything like a I Hope these people die and do you remember what what part of what this reminds me of and I'll I'll tell you I'm reminded of it is this guy on his van\nHad sites are put on that showing a a um a target from a crosshairs from a gun the sites on the faces of deeply dislikes Michael Moore and Van Jones and Hillary Clinton\nAnd you remember when Gabby Giffords was shot and she ended up being shot by somebody was on the left who was pro marijuana legalization is basically an not but he was on the left\nAnd um and and people try to associate that with Sarah Palin who said that there are certain congressional seats that we should target to pick up and they put a that none of our picture of Gabby Giffords but over a a map that showed her congressional seat\nThat's just stretching it and and trying to criminalize opposition which I think is poisonous we'll be right back [noise]\n\nA a night twenty the answer\nFive year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nFully funds President Trump's border\nExpands caseload ... women\nAnd insurers only of American citizens have the right\nConservative solution America deserves the leadership President Trump's nice\nThat's conservative God was my cat was\nPresident Trump's visit time for the wall\nAnd tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy is built the wall and enforce the law at\nWay for my safety forty ...

[noise] that I think are not constructive uh this is a tweet from a couple of days ago before they saw this a crime\nThe series of crimes actually President Trump tweeted a very big part of the ANC\nYour anger capitalized we see today in our society is caused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description\nUm then he says mainstream media must clean up its act fast and fast all capitalized with an exclamation point um\nWhat's my big problem there were just one word which is purposeful\nPurposely falls and an accurate reporting\nIn other words this is not to say that there isn't an accurate reporting there is not to say there is and biased reporting there is but the idea that it's purposely falls that as part of a conspiracy that I honestly journalists don't go into the business and this is true of able on Fox News as to where people on\nAnd another great day and

country\nThat alleged perpetrator has been apprehended he has been interrogated or the proof is accumulating and the prospect is he will be going away for some forty eight years but\nThe president of the United states charged us earlier today and I think in an appropriate and dignified way with the necessity of people actually coming together and transcending some of the bitterness and viciousness of our politics recently\nAnd I want to speak to you for a few moments or with a friend and somebody who I I view as a very significant ally for constitutional causes his name as Michael Ferris he is the president the c._e._o. and general counsel of the alliance defending freedom\nAnd uh and and like we were just talking off the air for a moment\nUh I think we agree that one of the essential elements of trying to\nTo reduce the levels of polarization and hostility and viciousness and meanness and craziness that has afflicted American politics is to affirm freedom of speech and freedom of conscience freedom of face and\nThey just failed to hit the pig six in the birthplace lottery by what moral right do we tell them to go back to pick up while a capital of Honduras and hope that their

that you have at least one generation maybe two maybe three maybe ten generations of people work very hard for this country\nAnd that gives you more of a right then people born abroad\nTo enjoy the blessings of this country isn't that basic isn't that sensible\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd then making ... concedes\nA truly open borders policy has no constituency in the American electorate\nBut it's the implicit philosophical framing of most news media stories on immigration which tend to focus on the Mike Rowe problems of the individuals not the macro problem of just how many of those individuals the country can admit\nShe says this\nIs easy to say no of course we can't let in every single person wants to come because doing so would transform this
