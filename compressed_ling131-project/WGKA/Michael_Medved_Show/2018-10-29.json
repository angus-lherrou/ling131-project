Need to go through all the permit process which is get by so many people\nNumber one culture and politics [noise] some Michael\nAnother great day another great we in fact in this greatest nation on God's green earth and yes a great nation and yes a great day despite disturbing events over the weekend and [noise]\nToday vis a news just breaking a student was shot dead at uh North Carolina high school this morning\nPrompting parents to descend on the campus to find their children a student was taken into custody after the shooting unfolded at butler high school in Matthews North Carolina about twelve miles outside of Charlotte [noise] the Matthews police departments that\nAuthorities had the shooting was believed to be an isolated incident\nAnd at the scene had been secured by police thank God for the police and thank God for the police in Pittsburgh and thank God for the work of law enforcement in diffusing those bombs and apprehending the evil bomber and yes he is evil he's not just pathetic\nHe's evil and it's possible to be both of course everybody wonders about what are the political implications of all this I Want to go a little bit deeper than that but we'll get to that too\nAnd I want to talk about what this means about America\nAre we coming apart or we experiencing a total social breakdown something utterly unprecedented in and this is just the worst thing in the world\nNo we're fine we're fine\nOne of the most beautiful things I ever heard I really mean it was the announcement on all the media and it was based upon a statement by the Anti Defamation league which monitors\nAnti Semitism and anti Semitic incidents they reported that the horrible attack on Pittsburgh and yes it was horrible and was nightmarish was pure evil\nThat that attack was the deadliest single attack against American Jews in the nearly four hundred years that we've lived in North America think about what that means\nWhat an indication of how blessed we are how unbelievably fortunate we are with this great country one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number [noise] um let me let me give you a little bit of\nPersonal perspective and I don't usually do this but this is very personal I'm not from Pittsburgh I'm from Philadelphia originally but of course we have friends in Pittsburgh I have war shipped and congregations\nNot at the tree of life synagogue but congregations in squirrel hill Pennsylvania we have squirrels as a world where we have friends in squirrel hill I'm Stuart squirrels too and in addition to the humans but I'm\n... the the tank is devastating and it's horrible and it's nightmarish\nBut uh I think perspective is a hundred percent necessary and what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a White House press briefing I think this\nCould be her best press briefing today as she made a very important point which is when news of this attack came out the very first thing President Trump did was to condemn\nAnti Semitism extremism hatred bigotry that kind of sickness that led to this attack and the very first thing that many voices in the news media did she said the media in\nGeneral but it it can generalize many voices very first thing they did was to blame Trump and to blame his rhetoric and I think that stinks and I think the attempt by some radicals\nAnd they are radicals in Pittsburgh to hijack this tragedy saying that the president in the first lady won't be welcoming Pittsburgh because of their past rhetoric let me make something clear I guarantee you those people who have signed that position they're sixteen thousand of them\nDo not speak for Pittsburgh and they emphatically do not speak for the Jewish people in the United states\nI Am I found out about this\nOn Saturday morning after I walked to synagogue and and what I usually do and I mentioned this before\nOr our son and daughter in law and a almost two year old granddaughter live not far from our synagogue a ... I live further away so I Walk the close to three miles and then I stop in\nA with Danny in in Rochelle and Julia and maybe for a cup of tea but just to catch up on the week and to actually see this adorable little girl and this week uh Danny\nWalked with me from his home in the two of us walk together to synagogue and which is just literally has his houses clubs and when we got\nThere or something strange\nBecause there was a guy we know a dear friend actually Christian guy\nWho is a former marine officer a marine aviator I Know you're never a former marine you're always a marine and and Charlie's a marine\nHe's also a world famous honest or opera singer and an aunt or a instructor and NRA last life member and he was standing in the back of our synagogue again he's Christian he's not Jewish\nAnd I came up and great on a Charlie what's going on uh it's great to see you and I said you haven't heard I said no what happened he said there were a lot of people killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh and I just wanted to come out here\nTo help protect my friends\nAnd it was so overwhelmingly beautiful and it's such a demonstration of America that this marine from Nebraska\nWould see fit now as it turns out we also have an armed security guard we also have at least five members of our congregation um and it's religiously because we have a ... enclosure and a rover out it they they're packing\nOn there and they're also guys who are like members of the n._r._a. and they're ready\nSo we now I'm not suggesting that every congregation that countries should do this but this was part of our factor and then part of what happened was that um when when Danny heard the news\nHe said well maybe I ought to go back home and tell where shall not to bring Julia because you know coming to a two year old and if you're expecting some World War three it said come on we'll we'll be fine we're fine\nAnd he said sure and and the baby came and she had a great time she played was a big girls in sort of behind the services and then we had our um our our kid is like our social after the services and everything was fine now there was there was\nOf course there are special prayers and a mention of what had happened in Pittsburgh we didn't yet know the identity of the killer and this is part of of what is so horrible about this is that um that this occurred on\nOn on the Sabbath and it's ironic those of you listen to a lot of this show I ended the show on friday by talking about the importance of the Sabbath and how much I was looking forward to the Sabbath and and the value of actually turning off\nA media for one day a week and it's because of turning off those media that I only found out when I actually arrived in synagogue what had happened but you know ... everybody\nWho's Jewish pays attention to this stuff and you have in the back of your mind what's going to be necessary I I Know that that um to go if you ever go to synagogue in Mexico and I've\nGone to services in Mexico city and Los ... which is a a neighborhood was central Jewish community in Mexico city they're they have really heavily armed security guards and metal detectors and\nWell but that's that's basically the Mexico such an unsafe well it's not nearly as bad as Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador and we'll be talking about the caravan in a moment to\nBut uh it it is simply wrong well here's what Howard Simon said Howard find men for years of Newsweek he was commenting on MSNBC and uh this is what he said uh because I think it's it's just dead wrong and we need to answer answer it back here Simon\nAs much as the Jews ... know their own history this was a lot of Jewish story this was an American story for says America story about the ... of our social fabric and the rise of violence as a way of expressing yourself in this country\nThat we haven't seen the likes of in modern times if ever we've had civil wars we've had strife\nBut we've never had this kind of individual violence against groups based on hate the way we're seeing the bubble up now ah and that's my concern and that should be all of our concerns on this morning\nOkay that's ridiculous it is ridiculous the first in modern times and still in some ways most horrifying killing at a place of religious sanctity was the four little girls\nWell I run again I'm ... and here's the thing he answered the bad each or hate each other we wanted to find that is more speech and always will\nOkay it's a certain kind of a ban speech sure but hate speech is different and a direct threat is different when he says uh I've I've had enough the Jews are committing genocide against my people are ... and then he said screw optics I'm going in\nOkay if you see that kind of thing and you should be monitoring this kind of post that was a couple of hours before he went in\nA you know to find the authorities because it is clearly a threat and uh they're interchange also included this\nHe says he created gap because he saw no room for conservative points of view on social media take Twitter\nWhere thousands upon thousands of people calling for someone to kill Donald Trump anger going to kill Donald Trump\nExpressing hate toward white people towards Christian towards minorities who may now Donald Trump or they allow ate the view that certain groups and certain people\nOkay they allow hate to be viewed as certain groups and certain people that that ... he's he's correct there shouldn't be that kind of hatred toward anyone and by the way one of the names that has to be mentioned in this context as Farrah Khan\nWho recently compared a Jews to termites in infestation of past\nAnd um look at a Farrakhan for years and years and years has been spewing this anti Semitic garbage and yet he is honored by people on the left he was recently seated at a place of honor two seats away from Bill Clinton former president at a reserve Franklin's funeral\nAnd Farrakhan just like this guy Robert Ballard should be stricken from polite comical in conversation\nBecause of course ... to to talk about criticism of one group or another group that is free speech but when you go into Nazi tropes and you talked about genocidal conspiracies\nIt's dangerous\nAnd they're all to be some kind of notification or some kind of concern\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is

tomorrow with the first lady and I think that's a good thing\nThe um uh the letter that was signed by the sixteen thousand people says\nYou yourself called the murderer evil but yesterday's violence

this where the singer that finger [noise] the weather in deplorable or whether it's you know a enemies of the people and the press says it's just\nOn people and frankly I'm among\nAmong the press says well\nOkay I I mean you're entirely right the one thing that I Would be careful of Mr Weiss respectfully don't compare Louis Farrakhan the Donald Trump\nI mean Louis Farrakhan isn't open unapologetic lifelong anti Semite ... he is I mean he he he clearly is it doesn't even apologize for it anymore\nAnd uh he he is identified I don't know anyone who can plausibly say that Louis Farrakhan is not a hater of Jewish people\nAnd Donald Trump is so free of charge you can charge Trump with lots and lots of stuff but I I tweeted about this it is unequivocal that Donald Trump cares deeply about the state of Israel\nAnd as Sarah Huckabee Sanders said today he adores his Jewish grandchildren\nAnd the idea that the Donald Trump is quote dog whistling or is it some kind of deep anti Semite or that he's responsible for encouraging things like this synagogue attack by as ... said a guy who said he hated from\nAnd that's a ... and it's it's the worst kind of political smear and it's totally unfair\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number here was the opening statement at the White House press briefing or just about an hour ago from Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nOur nation mourns the loss of these extraordinary Americans and we also pray for those who are willing to our hearts are with the four brave police officers who were shot and injured while trying to stop the attack and we thank God for these officers and for every member of law enforcement so responded swiftly and bravely\nIn the wake of the attack we've witnessed Americans of every faith in tradition coming together to mourn with their fellow citizens to support one another and to stand in solidarity with America's Jewish community\nThe president cherishes the American Jewish community for everything it stands for and contributes to our country hit doors Jewish Americans as part of his own family the president is the grandfather of several Jewish grandchildren\nHis daughter is a Jewish American and his son in law's a descendent of Holocaust survivors\nTomorrow the president and first lady will travel to Pennsylvania to express their support of the American people and grief that Pittsburgh community\nOkay and that is the right thing to do by the way some props to the NFL of the Pittsburgh Steelers went on with their game and that was the right thing to do and yeah there was some religious Jewish people in the crowd USA Today wrote about them\nAnd there was a sign that I think called the uh the attention of many people which is hatred can't break\nA city of steel and by the way the Steelers one up but they were playing sorry you at the Cleveland Browns\nSo that wasn't a shot a John Jonathan Karl ah posed a question to Sarah Sanders about the the president's a legit responsibility on this hard\nWas it over the weekend that he could tone off his rocker if what we're seeing my that let's see if anything's fertile his words quote is fire approval\nCertainly ah the president wants a in moments where our country is hurting like we've seen 'em in the last several days of find ways to bring our country together and we've seen him do exactly that\nHowever the president is going to continue to draw a contrast a particularly as we go into the final days of an election the differences between the two parties particularly on policy differences you'll continue to see him make that contrast [laughter] ah but he has certainly I think\nFound those moments to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us can condemn as well\n[noise] okay and again I it is hard for me to imagine that Sarah could have handled\nThese these questions more effectively than she did Jonathan Karl kept a going at this and about President Trump's blaming the media which by the way yeah do I believe he should pull back on that of course it's tired it's stupid stop it\nUh but Jonathan Karl put the question of Sarah\nWhy is the author you say you're not going to be why is the author that very very first\nThing that the president didn't was condemned the attack sloth in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bomb the very first thing the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous [laughter]\nAccent is outrageous that that would be the very first reaction\nWas so many people in this country the I'm not finished the only person responsible for carrying out either of these heinous acts\nWere the individuals who carried them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders fault for the individual who shot up a baseball field of congressional Republicans you can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime\nWas the just the news media is the first one was the one place the blame here on the\nFront line the president's not is not responsible for these acts but again the very first action that the president did was condemn\nAh these heinous acts the very first thing that the media did was condemned the president and go after and try to place blame not just on the president but everybody that works in this administration the major news networks first public statement what's to blame the president\nAnd myself included I mean that is outrageous that anybody other than the individual who carry on the ground would hold that responsibility\nOkay and ... again particularly regarding the synagogue in in Pittsburgh when you talk about trying to divide the country the handful of people from a radical leftist group\nWho are trying to prevent the president's first lady from coming to Pittsburgh\nShould um straighten up and fly right I I mean he's the president of the United states\nAnd he's doing the right thing by going there\nWhich was a train wreck\nAnd again he probably should have been monitored before\nBut tell one of the things that is striking about a stays are say opt junior\nIs he's a phony Indian he claims to\nBe a seminal that's on all of the those posters and signs that are on that van that has been taken into custody by the FBI\nHe's on the phone to his family his father was Filipino American his mother was Sicilian American her maiden name was ... and the father abandoned the family apparently at a young age\nIt says a safe to say a junior was vulnerable nobody desperate to become a somebody this an article by ... Terkel which in the New York times he styles himself as a body builder builder\nHe was an exotic dancer which is hard to believe that that can't have paid well and entrepreneur and a member of the seminal tried\nIn the uh\nStatus hungry beach front world of South Florida in reality Mr say op was a bankrupt loner whose view the anger and spent years living in and out of a van according to court documents and interviews with people who knew him\nHe went on racist anti gay tirades at the Fort Lauderdale pizza shop where he worked as a night shift delivery man in two thousand Seventeen telling his manager or a lesbian that she and other gay people along with Democrat should all be put on to an island and then moved\nTo a great way to hold a job here to tell that to the manager\nAt a reunion event in two thousand Fifteen with his college soccer team he browbeat former team members with race or sex as conspiracy theories and what Mr say ox mother and sisters urged him to seek mental health treatment if seriously repelled their efforts and told his mother he hated her\nSo said Ronald ... who's a lawyer for the family will also represented Mr say off in a previous bombing case where he threatened to bomb electric company because he felt they build them too much\nOkay don't try this at home he was put on probation for that two thousand two threats to blow up transformers\nHere views even listen when his mother reminded Mr say off that he was not seminal but he was Filipino and Italian Mr low he said uh the story is is just goes on and it's incredibly depressing\nAnd it brings up something we've talked about a lot before\nWhich is in America we have a tremendous problem with untreated mental well is\nThis is obviously a mentally ill homeless person he's living in his van van

you think the American response should be\nAll at the moment excuse me the caravan of ... and while\nNot not white but it's it's okay when it arrives what should the American response ...\nAnd that matters to the shooting in Pittsburgh how\nBecause you just brought it up in relation to the show they in Pittsburgh the\nI'm Sorry you just did you you were the one you're the one who brought up the President Trump has spoken against the caravan very harshly\nAnd you were comparing that to the Pittsburgh shooter now I Am asking you what you believe that different from President Trump President Trump believes that it would be extraordinarily dangerous and I happen to agree with him\nTo simply allow all of these people to enter the United states without authorization or to go and by the way what they're talking about doing and the administration I think is very smart Sarah Huckabee Sanders talked about a day\nIs saying that OK if you report at the border\nThen they will consider your application for asylum about a quarter of the people who apply for asylum actually get in three quarters get turned away but if you actually crossed the border illegally you will not be able to apply for asylum doesn't that sound sensible due\nAnd is that why Trump calls ... ...\nOh gee I I ... he hasn't used the term breeders or infestation he did use the term invasion recently\nAnd at the point about this is I'm Still asking you what do you think that the United states should do about this caravan of destitute people there's one from Guatemala a new one just started from El Salvador so they have a lot of miles Salvador and Honduras\nAn all I think I'm Sorry go and what should we do\nWell I think what you're ... proposed a sensible they arrived when they're process the wave at all or asylum seekers are our process trial\nCorrect correct and that that apparently is what the administration is talking about the the troops are at the border\nLike oh well it it is not what Trump that is not even remotely close to the invective to be the absolute incitement that Trump uses about this\nOkay I I ... I Do agree with you when you I've just acknowledge before that I think the president I'm the president can make clear that we are simply going with that we are going to try to defend our border and defend rule of law\nWithout a insulting or or giving groundless charges that there are a Middle Eastern terrorists mixed in with a caravan there apparently or not\nAnd all of that I think it's perfectly legitimate to object to what Trump is saying but that has nothing to do with somebody who is a classic anti Semite as this one was and who finally acted on it let's go to Jamie in San Diego Jamie you're on the Michael met that show\nI think that um I heard a shortly after the shooting there was a probably a rabbi sorry chemical enable one of the new channel and he was a kind of

statements on this whole nonsense and it and it is nonsense\nAttempting to blame some of the issues in the media for the bombing attempt and for the particularly the synagogue shooting on Saturday came from Mike Pence he was on NBC on Sunday with a villain sterling listen\n\nThe the American people believe in the freedom of speech that throughout the history of this country we've always had\nA vigorous debate and then we settle those debates in the ballot box we don't settle them through extra threats of violence like pipe bombs that we saw some to the Obamas the Clintons CNN and others and\nYou have no tolerance for the kind of anti Semitic violence that rear its ugly head today have those for the fact of rhetoric\nThat new and the presidents have used though in the president just this morning referred to congresswoman as wacko is called people low IQ he's called people horse face a from athletes to the prime minister of Canada I guess the question here is\nHave you ever asked him to please not use that type of language when referring to other people for the case of civil discourse in this I think\nEveryone has their own style and frankly people on both sides of the aisle use strong language about our political differences but\nI just don't think you can connect to the threats are acts of violence on I don't think the American people connect to the American people believe that those who are responsible are are the people that actually conduct these threats\nOkay that's exactly right and that that one reason I'm basically that that I Would hope that the president would not use phrases like horse race or low IQ or\nA ... the basically the Rodney Dangerfield kind of a presidency\nBecause I don't think it's politically working anymore if it ever did once when he was running and Seventeen other Republicans and he could just appeal to his base right now between now and election day it's a question of mobilizing the base it's already mobilized it's a question of enlarging the base\nAnd getting some of the people who may be hesitant about that kind of approach and especially at a time of national tragedy and this is\nRaising the tone of discourse a little bit I think it would serve the president and the Republican Party and the country very well let's go to\nTo your calls to Frank in Burlington New Jersey Frank you're on the ...\nI'm I'm an evangelical Christian and I I absolutely believe the Bible tells us that\nThe Jews are God's chosen people and um it just seems like the most evil people in the history of had this proclivity to hate the Jews and I see it today and I really think it\nIt's more than surface hate I really almost think it's like almost I don't want the Satan inspired but it's um it's it's more than normal hate and I really think it shows a real ditch your disregard for God I really believe that\nWell again and and I and I appreciate your uh your your call and your sentiments Frank and of course that relates to genesis twelve three where Abraham this promise of than those who blesses descendants will be blessed and those who curses descendants will be curse\nOr the the point about all this is a\nThat they're the Bible even tells us a with a story of a mall like which is actually written about by a a ... we just played a clip with him before\nWhere there is something a deeply Neal listing against God and against all launching\nIn the idea from anyone that he is doing a virtuous hacked to birch burst into a synagogue before the beginnings of Sabbath prayers\nAnd murder a bunch of ... actually mostly elderly people um who were good and decent and hard working Americans um let us go to a a to fill in Minneapolis Phil you're on the Michael Mann that show\nHi Michael I think the one of one of the biggest problems is that we are so cheap and racism and anti Semite says anytime you disagree with somebody you're either racist or at that so that it and when we brought up against people who are truly hate hope it gets lost in the shop it\nJust gets it just becomes well\nI I think you're entirely correct and it's an extraordinarily important point it's the old story of crying wolf\nAnd it's why comparisons with Hitler or so mistaken and if everything is racist then it becomes nothing is racist you it means that you can't recognize and sanction the real thing when it happens appreciate your calling agree with you Dan in Columbus ohio you're on the Michael ...\nMichael I'm I was on and talk about what you and the Jamie already talked about all this regard that but I've been thinking a lot about it and uh [noise] I think\nThat people like me like you know white guys that are especially from the mid west in fact I was ... I don't think we should uh think we should have and you know they were responsible for what we should come out um\nOkay I I don't think there's there's any question um ... the ... as the president has done as I think\nEvery one of the country has done is appropriate um\nThe Britain Hume sent out a a strong tweet\nWe're driving down liberty avenue and my wife got attacks from my daughter said pray for us I Will call you later and my wife said recalling now\nThat is right or yeah what does it take to receive yeah so you ... and and basically you\nDescribe in your your piece in American Spectator a report from Pittsburgh is posted up at our website at Michael ... dot com along with information about polls wonderful book a pope and a president\nOr you describe in there how they wait it out they tucked in in the van they were writing in and then finally they were able to drive a little bit out of harm's way\nI Do you know what amazes me about this poll is that it's it's very much fits in with a I've gone back and looked at every deadly attack on a Jewish target in the United states\nSince Nineteen Seventy seven or so for the last forty years and ... ... there aren't that many of them\nAnd but most of the people who died in those attacks\nWere Christian people who are caught in the crossfire or or even the cross fire because mostly no one was firing back they were Christian people who were in some cases just wrongly targeted there was a a a beautiful guy very devout a Christian and the son of a minister\nWho in April thirteenth two thousand fourteen\nHe was killed by an anti Semite was attacking the Jewish community center he just brought his grandson there and the grandson was killed two for us singing audition they were doing a program that the Jewish community center\nYeah well that's precisely what were we were worried about was them getting caught in the crossfire also to Michael I immediately thought\nOf it because at first we didn't know who is doing the shooting right and so I thought okay what's that date October twenty seven twenty eight in the day before on friday and my Middle East politics classic grow City College we just finished teaching the Yom Kippur war of Nineteen Seventy three\nWhich it ended I think almost forty five years ago that day on Saturday\nSo I I immediately thought to myself I Wonder if this is a a radical she hottest attack no fortunately it wasn't\nThat had nothing to do with that but this this was just some loan wacko ... a Nazi apparently of who and I and ... the worst thing about something like this is I don't know what you could even do to stop it other than\nBetter surveillance possibly I don't know who would do the surveillance I Would say this people listening if you know somebody on Facebook or on social media who was posting vile hateful things like this and it was bragging about his weapons collection\nAnd and who's talking about maybe going down to the to the whatever synagogue to to beat up some juice it can get on the phone and just call the police\nAnd I I looked at as an added he can do that that is\nVery solid advice indeed we will be right back with Paul kangaroo I Want to get too We're in a political season we're eight days before a faithful election I\nI Wonder if Paul can help explain what the heck is going wrong in Pennsylvania for Republicans we'll be right back with that with professor Paul ...
