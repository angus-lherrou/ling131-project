hawk\nChuck firearms snow in Miami circling bucket for when you leave the man\n\nActing winemakers wind lovers wine adventures and all things one from around the globe\nYou are listening to a grape encounters radio with David Wilson you know gang there are certain get let's get on the show they wish you had like ten hours to talk to because they are so rich with information that would describe today I guess a shack she is the author of the wind lovers apprentice words\nOf wisdom for would be\nEnough files ... that you if you're interested wind it's a really super complicated subject in when you consider the fact that there are more ingredients in a glass of wine than there is in human blood you can understand why some people want to dig down very very deep to try to understand it I for one\nAm a big believer in you know trying to master\nThe information that's really gonna help you and then once you you are dead set on being a geek um\nTo learn as much as you need to learn to be happy\nLast may that sums it up some interplay\nI'll let you do you consider yourself a wind get bigger not\nConsider myself a wind cake that I've never gone down that path that you're describing it always sort of start to realize that they get a masters of wine and it takes longer for most people that it up to learn how to become a surgeon yeah what's that fundamental disturbing in some regard\nFor the book is really designed to kick it down a notch and for people who are want to get interested but it may be a little bit intimidated or don't have the time to study at the end up levels it gets just such a good solid entry level foundation\nThere is a plethora of material that is written for entry level wind enthusiasts what do you think is\nDifferent about what you're doing how you're approaching that that would make somebody want to read your book as opposed to wind one oh one or wine for dummies or you know any of those things\nWell what I really felt was missing was that high level kind of luck they give you enough detail but without bugging you down off of that you can kind of go in\nLook at the age does he need to and just read for ages about or Dell or about how to order one at a restaurant or about wind from Argentina\nA few minutes that it takes to read those four or five pages you don't have a really good foundation and and it's really kind of fast paced crazy world I think that that that's really what people need not two hundred and fifty pages on Italian Line because that's the kind of sit down and read that and and go through it and it's very pose oriented and the way that I structured\nIn terms of the region is much more of a bull appointee type of format without using\nI yeah and I and I think you you you imply a very important thing here too and we were talking about it in the last segment which is the regional differences between wind is unmistakable and if you can wrap your arms around just that much what one is all about and the fact that\nYou know there is a good chance I'm going to tell you that there's a good chance that if if if you have a bottle of Italian wine and you don't like it\nYou might not like most of what comes out of Italy right very good chance of that there's a very good chance that if you like the Seventy on blocks\nFrom New Zealand that you're going to like almost all of them and you may find yourself not liking California so non blocks as much because there there are very distinct qualities that occur because of the environment we call a tear while which is sort of a stuffy awkward for everything that impacts\nThe wine making experience but the bottom line is is that different places make things differently\nBut yeah it's it's fine and the ones that kind of fit your palette that fit your style\nAnd I always tell people that when you're self to tear usual it took a comfort zone and there's nothing wrong with it but you raise your hand up on the show by the the the raw that's next to it or or you know by by the shark native maybe from a different region than you're used to drinking and just tasted and try it and it because you never know\nLet's keep something straight here that if you're ordering wine in a restaurant from somebody I they can no more afford that expensive bottle then you can you shouldn't be embarrassed into spending more money than you need to spend because there's plenty of good wine out there at a decent price but but I have a minute left but having said that you know\nIt's okay to walk into a wine store and say you know I drink this or I drink bad even if it is a you know ... or two buck Chuck or inexpensive wine and ... you can certainly say you know and like\nThis I Believe is there something better than this and and and they're going to point you know in a direction or you're going to\nGo to somebody's house for dinner and they will live a port for you an Australian syrup for dinner you know men it was good write that down go into the wine shop and say this really I thought this was really good that they're and they're going to be able to point you in the right direction\nOr even even better X on your phone I cannot tell you how many yes of course\nYeah how many I had an amazing wind and I can't remember the name and I didn't take a picture so you're offering very founded by\nBut bear in mind is that if you go into a ... big retail shop and they've got cases stacked to the ceiling\nOf a a particular wine I'm probably not going to recommend that you buy that wine because it's a wine that's being blown out but if it's a small boutique winery lot of times you know they don't have the marketing to be able to sell their wines at uh\nThe price that they're worth so they at some point are going to unload those winds and if you can score some of those winds it's going to be wonderful but in the world of Google\nAnd all of these wonderful wind apps that are out there in so many people posting so much information on wine do your homework you're standing there and you see a twenty case high stack of wine put it in your phone\nYou know and and you might be surprised if it might come up and say this was a you know eighty three point wind ... don't drink that but it also might say oh the winery gotten a lot of trouble they made too much wine and the two thousand Seventeen and the vet a dump at this and bring pies out there buying you know it's like anything else Kathleen\nGosh I hate to say goodbye to you know we've had so much\nThat I really appreciate your time and and your support of the book and having a conversation with you it's been really delightful All right\nTo to find the book once again you're going to find the book at a Amazon dot com Barnes and noble noble you're going to find it a

Joe\nWe're just all over the place where we are all over the place good heavens we go with the ... sit there for the tech follows us or its stock or actually I think\nAlthough this week ... problems follow us oh my God yeah you know we can so relate to our audience on so many levels especially the level of my computer's acting up again thank you Microsoft not\nWindows apparently did enough for me and it doesn't appear to be that Eighteen oh nine update that freaks people out and causes all kinds of problems but guess what the other morning prior to my computer no actually had rebooting itself overnight\nI got nothing I can access any documents I Can't access\nEven Microsoft programs word outlook nuts that open Internet Explorer nothing not that I ever use that one that's the ... last on my list of browsers but how about the windows explore that is a simple thing won't open\nAll you need to get one thing you've got some more hard drive space when when when does the lead on your decades full the nice very nice thank God for backups yeah I Know I can hear some of them some of my audience right now saying get her back\nNo in fact I've replaced my computer with a Commodore sixty four [laughter]\nIt was more reliable yeah keyboard a little stiff\nBut at least some computing ah so that's the tech rage for me and you didn't even have to believe me very much [laughter] so I had to bleeping before we started recording the show oh boy that's for sure [laughter] but then as soon as I commend his studio no more of those not the words\nThere's microphones here mhm can't do that but boy when I go back to my desk later you'll hear more not he words like darn\nAnd things like that sucks sharks is a good one I think I heard a couple of diagnosis you did hear that now that at one point uh golly gee I think that in there to\nAt least we can assume that those were the arable one [laughter] what are they got tech news wise\nSo the parent company of MoviePass announced plans to speak to spin off the discount movie tickets subscription service and trace separate public company to another chapter in which has been a staggering rise and fall\nAre mostly fall on the news of city area will be called MoviePass entertainment holdings eight and it will be a film production and marketing exhibits in company\nA MoviePass entertainment is expected to list on the NASDAQ or an alternate trading market because they won't have a value to even\nBeyond as deck now and he doesn't twelve Business Insider called MoviePass one of the top twenty five most disruptive apps well it shows you how much Business Insider dance well in that and as recently as a year ago shares of movie passes corporate parent helium some episode analytics\nTraded it nearly four thousand dollars a piece\nNow as of the time or recording the show I checked the Yahoo Finance right before we came into studio there currently trading at about two cents pressure from four thousand a year ago last November they're cutting almost four thousand dollars a share a year later two cents to share what does that tell you\nYou think there's some values not in that company at all and this new spinoff will fail before it finishes spinning yeah\nI mean what a joke you at one point I even signed up and was using it and then they just started screwing their best customers and saying oh no no no you can't go see as much as a movie a day I never did that anyway that at the most I think I saw two and a week\nBut then they cut it down to three and a month for the same ten bucks and it was like no\nAnd then they mess that up to those of us that were on MoviePass at one point or another I don't know anybody that still doing it\nIf you are say your ten bucks because I Can't imagine the helpful to you because then it wasn't just fine three movies a month ten dollars that's still cheaper than one movie in most places\nBut then they were surge pricing they were adding up to five dollars more if a lot of people wanted to see the same movie which basically meant every Friday and Saturday Night when most people want to go out to a movie it was more costly\nAnd then they started a lemonade and movies from many theaters because they didn't have the money to pay the theaters\nWhen we talk a lot over the years here on into tomorrow about exploding hover boards and then exploding smartphones well now you can add exploding body cameras to the list of tech products that have experienced some catastrophic battery malfunctions\nThe NYPD said it was pulling thousands of the vibe view Eli five body worn cameras that its officers use after one of them exploded thanks yeah fortunately no one was injured because the officer wearing it noticed that there was smoke coming out of the bottom\nOf the device and immediately route removed it from his his uniform after we took it off the body cam then exploded\nThe NYPD uses over Fifteen thousand body cameras with about three thousand of them being this vi view model the vast majority of the others is a model that was made by taser well guess what taser bought five view\nA few months back so now it's it's a monopoly again and they're exploding at least one is so that's an interesting one I haven't heard yet and as a former police officer I'm always looking into these kinds of things anyway I haven't heard yet of others exploding sure it's happening\nBut if you know of them let us know two and we'll slammed them some are on the air\nAnd speaking of exploding little tip that I learned the hard way this week um if any of you are using one of those um video projectors for your home theater system and you haven't turned on and you notice a little Dustin don't use canned air to blow into it as it's on\nYeah follow this you do you miss this mess that was actually just yesterday and he's setting this up and we're we're noticing because we're setting it up with the ... most digital decorations and doing here out of the studio front window at night really cool digital decorations as they call them which are\nOf zombies trying to get out of there like at the windows and bloody shirts and stuff and goes flying around and pumpkins and magical the singing skeletons all kinds of fun stuff for Halloween right right\nAnd the only problem is the most projector the standard def one that we have is a very bright and the windows of the studio attended\nAnd so that wasn't getting out very well well we put this other projector in its place and said everything but Christ is focusing in on the window\nAnd noticed a bunch of us just like in the box on the inside yeah so you know I had to spread idea well here's the blue into it and then they move the dust stayed in front of the\nBowl you know and then we have this broad idea what we got a can of compressed air in the control room that we use to clean up the the mixing boards and stuff you know what to deter it let's try that blew into it a new fireball vow and there was a fireball shot out\nOf the projector and then he quickly turned it off and he goes well we've just blown that bold\nI hit the ball didn't blow\nApparently ... and it sort of like I said I Would say that's what we did during the dust out of it that it gets what there's no more dust\nTended projects beautifully in with a very bright scary projection 'cause it's Halloween stuff filtered on China's grave lines thinking like a great minds whichever the line is of the point being is that it was\nReally spooky it was a very large fireball and then that that uncommon hopefully for you burn the smell of electronics and we thought oh you know we've ruined the styles and dollar twelve hundred dollar project or let alone the bulb itself\nAll of a sudden we thought hey what what would it hurt you know he's he's on plugging it real quick and everything it led to plug it in and see if anything happens\nBecame on well doubled lit up everything was fine no dust\n... so we don't recommend fireball elimination of dust yeah but it works it works very strangely but a good tactic to but the fireball was wild was if I can tell was like the size of the projector bone\nAnd I thought well that was interesting I Wonder what else we burn up just pointed it smell that electronic burn smell not it's not a fun thing\nFacebook Messenger going back to simpler format in hopes of making users happier the messenger vice president stand Ted nasty things in the belly up put the focus back messaging and connecting according to a study done by messenger Seventy one percent of participants

first of all the the title of your book got our attention and I said well we talk about this on the show a lot you know too many people that are spending way too much time on their phone or in some cases\nIt's not just millennials that have no other part in their life it seems to just be on their device and there is certainly more to life above that I Love how even on the back of your of the cover of your book it says it's not you it's your phone\nWhich is so typical were with a breakup of any kind you know no no no it's not you it's me\nThough I think we should move on and it just sort

how to break up with your phone middle let's get into some of the fun stuff you cover\nSure well I'm a health and science journalist by background I'm already interested in behavioral change and the effect that things like work would be having on our mental and physical health\nBut also a couple of years ago just started to realize I was spending way too much time on my phone and in particular it came to a head when I had a baby and I notice that there were many times in which she would be looking at me and I will be looking down on my phone do and that really upset me yeah not a good feeling\nTo go out of mom right yeah right that they are over here\nRight right right it was definitely not a what I Want it to be\nDoing to her or with her or I mean you know also that wasn't what I wanted my experience whether it'd be like or my own life so it really was a wake up call to say how much time on my spending on that day by what am I getting out of it and is this really how I Want to be spending my time\nGood point because I mean something as simple as we talk about this all the time for years on this show\nDo you think life could be so much better if you unplug a little bit and
