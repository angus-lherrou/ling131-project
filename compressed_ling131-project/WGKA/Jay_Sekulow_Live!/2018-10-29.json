Michael ... come\nAnd I should also notice Brian did that uh the battle of New Orleans and the miraculous details concerning that battle also feature in my book the American miracle\nYeah the uh\nPresident Trump is restored Andrew Jackson's portrait to the White House and he clearly admires president Jackson I could President Trump for this moment in his presidency\nWith all of its challenges could he learn something from Jackson's example\nI think so because Jackson was like LBJ rail BJ was Jackson more where he said okay what do you need to get it done because you had to get what I Want done\nHe cut a lot of deals with the Senate leverage to leverage their power a gotten a lot of people's face but in the end he got things done and he ... he turned the economy over could Martin Van Buren actually with a surplus and he was the last president to do that not have a deficit\nSo I think that he had to make them deals for that to the same time uh you know both to programs at all out of the country to grow and he understood the working class more than ... percent more than that it was more the Monroe or the watch it\nUm you know more than John Quincy Adams says he was born a bigger means an orphan and he understood he really thought a Midwestern bend the south or the southwest was totally ignored\nSo I think that comes down to ... with the it's the same one in proportion I didn't even go it cuts of deals in order to average greater objective for sale and then see what happens\nAfter two years if you lose the house you don't see what happens after six years if you get the second term so I think that's what they need to learn what the relentless to fighting spirit he's pretty much got that down\n[laughter] yeah he does um but Jackson or in in terms of his fighting spirit also had this great ability\nOf making up with people that he was a fighting against a one point he had he had actually for a dual with uh\nI've been involved in a very bloody brawl with Thomas hard Benton the senator from Missouri who became one of his closest allies and he'll get his program through that may be comparable to the Ted Cruz Donald Trump relationship\nAnd Marco Rubio and Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham and be Nikki Haley a he has a lot of people that were critical of hair and working with it\nBy where they were willing to put aside and support them\nAnd for the most part everybody has I think this evolution others\nOther team is is much board supporter who Donald Trump is Larry Kudlow the Gary Cohn so Larry Larry Kudlow said this Donald Trump got to get over this free trade agreement cost you a free trade free trade is good and Donald Trump is is almost one Larry older but\nHe didn't ah he did not want to come in because he said yeah the I Can't really go along with Boston up all these deals but then after a few months after talking to him he's now in in the beginning 'cause we're you\nKnow I think I think I think the idea for Larry is that a ... as he's believing President Trump that the whole goal of a tougher negotiating posture is lower\nTariffs all around for us and for them we will be right back\nUh with just a few minutes more with Brian

sixty four thirty one tenth as we\nAcknowledge pray for and uh those affected by the uh the tree of life for the value of the shooting a condemning anti Semitism in and understanding that as an organization\nUm we do a lot to condemn the other boycott divested ... in the United states a lot of this anti Semitism on college campuses which is exactly what it is in the form of being anti Israel\nAnd then these distinctions that that these groups try to make which are just absurd um is getting something as organization we can bad some of these individuals we should all combat\nAnd acknowledges it is an issue uh that's been a ... in the United states as it is in most of the world unfortunately I'm a since the beginning of time and ah today on the broadcast partially focusing in on what Israel has been doing in response to the tax on the Jewish state\nOf Israel I think it's a unique time to point out there has been an escalation over the weekend in fact just this weekend\nIn Israel out of the Gaza Strip so targeted Israel thirty rockets were fired by Gaza based militants and this group is called Palestinian Islamic jihad or sometimes just referred to as Islamic jihad\nTo Israel as a government holds a mosque responsible\nFor Islamic jihad activities at ... home Austin Islamic jihad work together\nOften but there are times when they are separate and so you'll see that Islamic jihad is also\nBased in a Damascus is where a lot of their leaders are headquartered to get protection a so that they are not actually in harm's way directly and so I ... that their leadership there should be a mosque leadership Muslim brother ... leadership\nBoth groups emanating by the way from the Muslim Brotherhood at it from a mosque but interesting enough even though it's coming out of the Sunni world getting a lot of its funding from the sheer world in Iran so first let's talk about this weekend I'll go to Henry Hudson Harry\nThis weekend we saw really the escalation ... just specifically between a Islamic jihad and Israel says comes out of the Gaza Strip but thirty rockets being fired at the state of Israel and Israel responding back way that specific attacks on eighty targets\nAbsolutely so this is an important ... an ominous development\nAh these attacks are coming from gossip suggest that Hamas is working with the Islamic jihad it's working with Syria and ultimately it's working with Iran which is the source of\nMuch of them is just a in the middle east so in response to provocation essentially by Iran and its surrogates including the Islamic jihad has the law\nMilitants are in Syria\nIsrael has conducted an aggressive military campaign across\nA Syria against Iran backed militia groups and in ... this is highly necessary Israel cannot allow a these militants to build up an arsenal a as a basis of continued attacks on Israel\nAnd it could lead ultimately to another outbreak of a small or perhaps a large war\nYeah I mean you're talking about a again organizations that it made out of again the gods primarily here you've got the Gaza Strip though the Islamic jihad group unlike Hamas operates pretty heavily in the west bank as well so that is why they are a though a mosque because they're the governing power\nIn the Gaza Strip so if these are rockets are lodge Israel holds for most responsible for not preventing the rockets from being lost by these other groups and sometimes working in tandem ... again it's the middle east things get complicated but understand Islamic jihad group also operates in the west bank\nAre controlled by the a pillow or the Palestinian authority\nAnd so they but what is unique to uh to what kind of ties them all together\nIs the funding that they receive from Iran and specifically Iran's revolutionary guard forces where those funds flow through they flow through Damascus now even at a time when you would imagine that Syria is extremely unstable that has been one of the headquarters\nFor these Islamic ah a Palestinian Islamic terror groups SOS we're seeing an increase not just between\nA attacks in the Gaza Strip and Israel but specifically over just the past Eighteen months of the really an escalation what Israel is doing in Syria and and targeting Iranian forces there I mean one of their primary goals is to prevent Iran from having to have an occupying force inside Syria\nYeah exactly or over the last Eighteen months uh Israel has lost they think about two hundred airstrikes in Syria or in what really Israel is trying to do they're trying to to head off what would be a major major war in the middle east and they're doing that\nOr go through these air attacks first of all they're trying to stop Iran from having a permanent military base near the Israeli border they're trying to to head off a major war because they realize\nThat if Iran had a permanent presence there they've vowed to destroy Israel or if they hit that could increase weaponry to Hezbollah in Lebanon that again could lead to a major war\nAnd uh they're trying to block weapons shipments coming to Lebanon ah there are a lot of ground convoys going through Iraq across Syria into Lebanon to arm Hezbollah and also to to arm Iranian backed militias so he was trying to stop that but the frightening thing you're talking about the the missiles being fired from from the Gaza Strip\nOr just last week Israeli intelligence or released a report that once again Iran is using civilian airliners to ship weapons in weapons components the missiles that have been fired from Gaza and Israel and from Lebanon in Israel\nThey are not being guided missiles there sort of lobbed into the territory hoping that they will hit something however last week\nIt was revealed that some of these civilian planes are now delivering sophisticated guidance systems to Hezbollah so they can take these guidance systems install it into missiles so that they can actually pinpoint specific targets in Israel that is a major game changer in this conflict Iran is really\nA behaving in a dangerous in reckless fashion\nAnd uh the terror groups and that you and here he talked about they could not do what they do without the financial support of Iran and also\nThe weapons that are applied to these groups by or on a Iran they they try to use their proxies so they can have plausible deniability ... but their goal is the destruction of the nation of Israel\nAnd they receive guided shows like they just gave all these resources have been sick you do what you want they're coming with that that's kind of the terrorists so that Iran is able to control these groups whether it's Hezbollah or you're talking about\nLike Islamic jihad or even a boss I they want to be able to control them and their actions so they do this at the ... who you're talking about the weapons as incentives but understand Iran's role of this I think just to underscore the west is talking about using the civilian aircraft\nA as a military a way of a delivery military good to recognize terror organizations take it was the general Jack Keane as well he was discussing how this has been uncovered ...\nThis is something newly uncovered that Iran has started to do what's happening\nIs Iran is very aggressive because Syria means so much to them so they fly on charted airplanes or their military aircraft in in the ... as a missiles ammunition commodities they also use commercial airlines to do the very same thing\nAnd then they're driving through Iraq and to eastern Syria and bringing also ammunition and supplies to that\nThe White House who said that quote Iran and Hezbollah cannot be allowed\nTo build an arsenal of weapons on Israel's border that threatens the region and we have there's a question that came in so interesting what Harry on Facebook and we will get your phone calls as well we've got callers hold on his well one hundred sixty four thirty one said if you want to talk to us on air that's one eight hundred six eight for three one zero\nBut I'd call recall there said besides the United states which countries in the middle east\nBack is against terror groups supported by Iran it's a complicated question because many of\nCountries that do not support Israel would would also do support Iran in the Gulf states that some have more a behind the scenes been supportive of Israel but certainly this again shows you that this question or it could be an entire thesis on the on the middle east\nAbsolutely you could certainly write a number of books on ... politics I think it's clear beyond question that the public posture of most Middle Eastern countries is one of opposition to Israel on the other hand um based on real politic\nThere the the increase sanctions on Iran kick back in so rod is is you will see this kind of PR move internationally by Iran a now but listen to their foreign minister or just yesterday\nOn an American a Sunday news program CBS face the nation tasteless\nI think the blankets point to the U.S provides to see how they view on Israel has enabled them to a cat a of a straw cities that will do\nThan all takes instead\nAnd I I mean Harry I'll go right to you there that is the Iranian foreign minister tying\nThese two groups that are two countries together as the U.S works with ... and different and unique ways but trying to tie publicly what is it not putting knowledge by Saudi Arabia publicly but that they are somehow a working together against Iran that's why he's tried to go after them obviously\nYou're absolutely correct essentially what the Iranian foreign minister is trying to do he is trying to deflect attention away from the Iranian\nMalignancy be rainy and atrocities in the middle east by blaming the cross cities that are ongoing in the middle east on Saudi Arabia\nAnd Israel also essentially it's outrageous so wrong is the number one state sponsor of terror in the world period and it's clear\nBeyond question that Iran has\nA plan and money they are attempting to mastermind can all of the middle east in Syria and Lebanon and in\nGaza as the launch pad for future wars or for control of\nThe middle east or extending to Yemen and the central lead to the Saudi Arabian\nPeninsula but a lot of people also started asking on Facebook and then we've got a call about it as well we'll get to our second half hour of the Russian role in this [noise] how are they aligned\nWith Iran why are they aligned\nGot a book out about that will take your calls one eight hundred six aid for thirty one to that one eight hundred sixty four thirty one Ted as we update you on the latest news out of the middle east involving Israel\nHow it effects are U.S interests of course this is a eight days out from our mid term elections here in the United states the second half hour adjacent you'll live up a great time to get your phone calls in his right now one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten we'll be right back\nThat moon again said I've never before endorsed the pain relief product of any kind [noise] until now than to relieve factor my wife is real because of her neck and shoulder pain and let's face it almost everybody over fifty has occasional aches and pains new to\nAging or exercise and the three week quick start is now discounted to own a Nineteen Ninety five hits a hundred per cent drug free and the majority of people order it's going to order more let's see if we can get you to pay to go to relieve factor\nDot com [noise] fly from\nWashington DC secular life\n[noise] and now\nComebacks Jason you'll live if you're just joining us the second half of the broadcast let us just dollars once again condemn the attack that occurred in Pittsburgh on Saturday\nAgainst the Jewish community there at the tree of life synagogue with eleven innocent people killed six or injured some critical including law enforcement officials who bravely responded to a\nA load a gunman a who was fueled by anti Semitism something we must always condemn and uh uh we work on it the American civil law and justice our work gives the boycott they've asked for sanctions moving in the United states and on college campuses as well\nAnd this idea ideological anti Semitism or but that ... you could see how that again that ideal ideology could be a turn unfortunately into or this horrendous or\nTo fuel this kind of horrendous attack so we condemn that uh it condemned fight anti Semitism wherever we see it but also I again must be praying for those who have who have been it instantly or those people who were killed uh uh who were there to uh at their house of worship for various reasons that day\nAnd so I get a a thoughts and prayers with that a community and as we focus in on what is happening around the world but there's a we've seen you know whether that was the the Bobby incidents that occurred to you know explosives and thankfully no one was injured that person gets apprehended in Florida who was responsible for that\nThere's been a lot going on in our own country that is taken away a rightfully so to some extent obviously you've got to focus on what type of your country\nBut to understand what's also happening around the world because we had a ship back into politics as well mid term elections but all of this affects us as Americans so what is happening inside Israel what is happening in the middle east very important has it got as much attention\nIn the last few weeks I think it deserves so today because this increased by Israel and their response to\nUh the radical groups are operating out of the Gaza Strip many who are headquartered in Syria and also increase the their Israeli actions inside Syria being backed by the White House be backed by the Trump Administration\nWanted to go to the phones about this as well because there's another factor in this we haven't yet address on air or we should just during the break because we got comics coming in from Jason on Facebook\nAnd also call coming in from Phil in New York on line to feel welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nIf you're on the air very much for taking my call it means a lot to me and he went to my question my question is Russia's close to Ninety percent they Christian nation why are they like let's say ... theocracy and two oh\nYeah so what I Would say you got to kind of divorce the people oftentimes from the government especially in or we see this off the ties in countries like Russia um where the foreign policy of the government off to die just don't match up to the views of the people\nSo that that that the idea here again it's not so much Russia's be anti Israel west it's rush or the Russian government because they work with the Israeli government when it's in their interest is the Russian government are working for their own interest there they like in China I Would see more to all these countries\nUm they they are not ideologically tied to any more this idea of spreading around this view of communism or they don't have that anymore so it's all about their own interest ultimately that they don't have the other ties of\nA like A Rod's got the ideological tired to to why they want to support these groups it Russia's doing it for themselves\nAbsolutely ... their opportunistic you know they're looking for what will what will you forward their own national interest and Russia what they're looking for in Syria to the court to the caller's point first of all\nThe while the people of Russia or Ninety percent orthodox Christians the government is not a Christian government but in addition to that Russia they want to have a warm water port permanently in Syria on the Mediterranean so that's part of their strategic interest\nBut also Russia is supplying Syria they're trying to prop up the Assad government with anti aircraft missiles\nIt's a volatile part of the world and maybe we can talk rather than a moment but it's a tinderbox ah it's it's it's hard to predict exactly what will happen there\nYeah I mean she got a lot of different layers and I think our caller brings up and getting people focus on but you also have to build put the puzzle together as you are looking at what's happening inside Israel we can you take your phone calls this\n... do you believe these foreign policy issues will be to the mid term elections or do you think everyone is focused on domestic issues where they'll vote on their pocketbooks one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten\nEight days after the midterm elections so his foreign policy how much of an impact do you
