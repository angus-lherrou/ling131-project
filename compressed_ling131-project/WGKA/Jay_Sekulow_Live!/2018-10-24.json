evacuated in New York the headquarters of CNN but also a lot of other companies a mall\nOr a well though the hotel Mandarin Oriental or know devices have exploded no one has been injured or they appear to all be linked and that is the news that we have right now that want to focus the attention\nOn the the comedy\nUh this this caravan of migrants emanating out of Honduras but people adding onto the care of it every single day ... news reports are estimating\nThis is somewhere between seven to fourteen thousand people that occurred how dirty president has asked the people to return he is more conservative\nBut this is being brought on by the left in Honduras in Central America this push to or the one hand come to United States of America\nOr the other hand bird American flags on the way I'm so very political and left to motivate I'm sure their children and women in this care of it being used by this process\nWho are trying to escape\nA to a better life and we saw that the last time this happened back in April of ... what did dwindled down to about four hundred people and the majority of those people ended up getting through the asylum process but when you're talking about for that was started with Fifteen hundred ... a a four hundred or so\nThis is starting this is about fourteen thousand people and we are calling hard Mexico to work alongside the United states in preventing this crisis at the border\nI let's take a listen to President Trump\nOr talking about how to work with Mexico first they don't want to take your phone calls 'cause listen folks there they're looking at two different routes and we got leaders in both the states they're looking at the the San Diego Tijuana border crossing and also ... Texas a border crossing a the ... the Texas border crossing is closer\nLast time they chose the Tijuana uh San Diego area but I mean they get to states or could be in the mix here I I Want to take your phone calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty what Ted what should be done\nTo stop this wave of illegal immigration fourteen thousand people on their way a and I think it's very sad that there'll be motivated to buy these leftist activists in their own country maybe here the United states\nAs well let's listen to President Trump\nIs working with us\nThere is a movement toward our country is a way for the hair\nAnd his group that has around this table will be involved\nAnd others will have a we cannot let people come into the illegally\nRight now the Caribbean is about one thousand miles away from\nThe closest us border that would be in ... Texas and about twenty two hundred miles away from the border crossing it Tijuana says President Trump said there is time to work with Mexico to work together or with Mexico this I think underscores the need for increased border security and the wall\nIf you have the wall or you can have the situation and certainly you don't want\nFourteen thousand people at the wall you would still have to work on these types of caravans but it would be a big deterrent\nOr because you people would do what they would be up against when they reached the U.S a southern border take your phone calls one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to one eight hundred six eight four thirty one to let me go to\nA Harry ... the idea here this goes to also national security it's not just a humanitarian issue that department of homeland security\nHas said that they in a tweet from their spokesperson they can confirm I'm putting them that they're individuals within the caravan who who are gang members or have significant criminal histories citizens of countries have since outside of Central America including the middle east\nAfrica South Asia and elsewhere are currently traveling through Mexico toward the U.S I mean that is from the department of homeland security doing their intelligence work to figure out who these people are\nAbsolutely so broadly speaking the caravan is a challenge to the integrity of the U. S. borders it's a challenge to the rule of law I'm much more directly with respect to some of these individuals who are in Balad and the care of and\nMany of those individuals are a direct\nThreat to US security or some of them are smugglers some of them are drug smugglers human trafficking smugglers cetera\nAnd some of them are perhaps harbor terrorists ambitions and so it would be difficult to look at a mass of fourteen thousand people say\nAnd then separate out those who are legitimate a refugee claimants from those who wish to do us harm so we should engage in a full throated a diplomatic effort\nParticularly with Mexico and Honduras to stem the flow we must intervene before the caravan reaches our border\nIt's important to note as you indicated earlier Jordan that many of the individuals who are in the caravan a base don't seem to like the United states so why are they in the caravan why are they coming\nWhy are they ... up perhaps uh putting swastikas on American flags if they desperately our rent\nA one to be come refugee immigrants to the United states so there are lots of questions out there uh yes we should enforce our law\nWith compassion a but we should seek to intervene in stem the flow before it reaches our border\nOne eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tennis number you call if you want to talk to us on the air is John's call ready in California on line three John welcome to Jay Sekulow live you're certainly in a state where\nA a you deal with the illegal immigration on a daily basis and the the this caravan could be heading your way they haven't made that decision yet on which way to turn towards California or Texas or they'll get that far but John thanks for calling you're on the air\nLight pole or is ... ... what ... ... or ... or ... or so people get ... ... ... ... like ...\nFor you secretary's day ... pale I think in the ... in the emergency kind of situation I last year I could build a wall in this time period a you know there are thousand miles away from our closest border it's that's not going to happen I agree Congress should have already passed that I think the president agrees Congress should have already passed that so the construction\nCould begin to take a listen to secretary of state Mike Pompeo ate a clear message to all of those people in the care of and they don't go to Andy to talk about really whose role in the U.S government this is\nAt this point when you've got the caravan of fourteen thousand people heading our white take a listen to my ...\nThe United states also has a message for those who are currently part of this caravan\nFor any caravan which follows you will not be successful at getting into the United states illegally no matter what\nI repeat the carbon will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances if you stick to come here go through the normal refugee process if you apply for refugee status a permanent solution as possible in Mexico or at a third country but I can tell you with certainty we're determined that illegal entry into the United states from this caravan will not be possible\nBut they're good I think this and he goes to the main point which is that at this stage of the game this is the executive branch role because you've got to deal with a foreign country\nA Congress really doesn't have time to act that can't build a wall or they can authorize it but they can't build it up so it it comes up to the executive to work with yet another Ford power to prevent this group of individuals from reaching one of our southern border itch reports\nYes that is correct Jordan is an executive branch obligation responsibility right now Congress is out of session and they don't come back on November thirteenth after the elections were were they when they shouldn't have been doing these this legislating about this they were a wall\nOr they were not doing their job they were not doing\nAnd the chain link fences coming down and the Mexican authorities\nNowhere to be seen and unable to interdict and to stop this\nA tidal wave of humanity that was just a inexorably moving in an orderly direction toward the United states and that was a very frightening spectacle to me I looked at a gas in my mouth fell open as I'm looking at this and I'm saying this is internally within the Mexican nation\nAnd they ... they reached the border or wherever the crossing was a that they uh\nUh had gated and fenced off and he was a Mexican authorities could do absolutely nothing or do to prevent this ... crossing from taking place [noise]\nLet me go to Steve in Florida on line six I think Steve got a good point it relates back to the last time this happened in April Steve welcome to the sec you'll live you're on the air\nOr do you today a real good Steve\nOur military has the ability to put a temporary we're just showing the to why don't we have the ability to do the same thing with walls with these people being over a thousand miles away it should be able to set up\nI Believe we actually did that when it was a smaller group so back in April there were walls set up a to make sure that individuals uh that was a much smaller number again that we're talking about uh about Fifteen hundred total ... ended up being about five hundred that made it to the wall\nBut there was a wall in place I I don't know if it was a temporary\nStructure put there by the military or certainly one that was reinforced hairy so yes you could harried certainly have the time with a thousand miles out or twenty two hundred miles out depending on which border crossing a this group decides to go to if they split up to go to different\nA border crossings there there are certainly times to reinforce specific areas of the border\nI think you're absolutely right Jordan it's important also to note that the border between the United states in Mexico is very very long yeah and so the U.S military or to the extent that they are able to put up temporary structures\nTo impede a border crossings are they will perhaps have to wait about in the sense to find\nOut what direction or the caravan is going to take\n'em but they're all still then be time to put up some temporary structures to impede the caravan from crossing into the United states but I also think we should focus um most of our efforts at the moment\nOn diplomatic ah efforts with respect to Mexico um I think secretary of state pump pale according to CNN News has said that the caravan will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances\nYou know and so that is why I think again very important folks to ... this is a this is the executive branch issue right now\nCongress could certainly pass federal laws prevent this in the future but right now the executive has to deal with what they're dealing with we come back we'll take more your phone call second half hour one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tenth will update you on the suspicious device says

investigation on going it appears to be leaked\nAll these devices do appear to be late we will continue to update you throughout our show today as the news wards are the biggest do is probably the ... in New York on Columbus Circle\nIs evacuated that includes a what a seat in the major hubs includes also a a major hotel the Mandarin Oriental shopping center restaurants a a grocery store and other offices so that is significant than it is shut down such an important building an area\nIn New York City the other issue that we're focusing on the most take your calls about the ... is this caravan\nOf fourteen thousand a day that's what the estimate is fourteen thousand heading towards a U.S border coming down through Mexico\nA but had it been eating out of the Honduras or add a this is much larger than the care of and that was that was back in April which at its biggest point was Fifteen hundred we do their political motivations behind this caravan from the left\nOut of Central America specifically out of ... features sherbet if president of ... ask people to return and offered them assisted to help\nTo get back on their feet it does so they're doing the right thing but they don't have the power if these people back so we've got to work with Mexico before this ends up on our border or the estimates are there about a thousand miles away from the closest Porter a tree in Texas\nEnded a couple of thousand miles away from the border a tree in California we're going to take your phone calls on it now one eight hundred sixty four thirty what Ted I just called for Pennsylvania on line one I welcome to Jay sexual alive\nThank you happy Wednesday\nThey it\nMy question is can you give me a couple of damage to that first off they would stay in their own troops also provide some type of care provision for the court\nAnd it would eliminate some of the responsibility of some of the bigger pointing going on towards the U.S and this is more than just the English issue\nI think right now the U.S is doing reports that an estimated the numbers of people I don't ever fact Patsy on Facebook right wrote it really you would try to get involved so she was taking the safety I uh\nI think that what is troubling is that whether you it gets involved or\nThey will start telling everyone who has to take who don't suffer or see out the numbers at city of refugee camps and I don't think that's the situation we want to be at right now I think this could be handled\nBy two major powers the United states and Mexico\nWho worked side by side this is not good for Mexico the U.S could provide the support to make sure the Mexican authorities have the support necessary to prevent this from causing more trouble in Mexico it ultimately trouble on our border in the United states by the way we talk about\nWhat's happening towards our border we're talking about what's happening in Mexico that they're dealing with because until you cross over your in Mexico so this is they have a serious interest in getting the situation under control but I don't believe that we would want a the UN or to be more involved\nIn this process at this point in time what do you have to four and a\nHalf hours could handle it who have the resources to handle the situation we will take your phone calls one hundred sixty four thirty one that's one eight hundred and sixty four three one
