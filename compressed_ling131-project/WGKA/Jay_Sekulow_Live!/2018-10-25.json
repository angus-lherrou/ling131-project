Jay secular here with our team I've been watching it with any ... uh Harry hotter center director of policy is in our studios in our media center so uh this is what's happened is they go Jason is going on from what I I've been able to determine what we're seeing also in the media reports between the United states and Mexico and ... how to handle\nWhat is called the migrants caravan as attorney said now deeper into Mexico it's still far away from the United states\nBut our borders but might say far away a about a thousand miles in some cases some cases Seventeen hundred\nBut uh it's in Mexico and it said that they've tried determination right now uh as to what to do there is this approach called metering which would slow the flow of migrants the ports of entry\nAh that's one aspect that's being done also negotiations on whether the U.S could deport ... van migrants back to Mexico or to their country of origin of process known as return to territory because generally when you seek asylum\nFrom one of the uh country the first country you get to is generally where you're seeking asylum if in fact that country would be a safety net for for the asylum seeker\nYeah during the idea is is the first countries that you reach in which you feel safe is a country that should be the one that receives the application for your asylum so\nThey started in Honduras Guatemala El Salvador they move north through Mexico when would theme it would seem very obvious and Mexico should be the first country in which asylum and saw it or not the United states\nSo that is that is a correct statement of what the applicable international law is a on this score\nSo I guess the question really becomes here that and that's what you look at area and that is what we're calling from we called for from the outset of this is intervention inside Mexico in cooperation with Mexican authorities and it seems to be that's where some of this was going\nAbsolutely so we have suggested previously at the L. A. C. O. J. that diplomatic negotiations are in essential in resolving this crisis\nWe have suggested that such efforts should be aimed at stemming the flow of migrants slowing them down and finally stopping them before they reach us ports of entry\nAnd so late yesterday CNN reported on negotiations between the United states and Mexico\nOn how to handle the migrant a caravan and I'm sure there are additional negotiations and discussions that are ongoing or between light pump pale and his Mexican counterpart and between the president of the United states and the leader of the Mexican government\nOr so as you correctly suggested Jay or the focus of the discussions now is on a process called metering which would indeed slow down the flow of migrants there's some evidence from news reports\nAbout the number of migrants has actually dissipated which would be a help for\nA a a outcome\nUm but it's still potentially a future crisis and we need to uh maintain a clear focus on negotiations with Mexico and these other countries we also should continue to place pressure on\nThe Honduran ... or ... or the ... uh and the leaders of the Guatemalan government um they receive huge amounts of aid from the United states and I think it's correct\nOr to tell them that there will indeed be consequences if indeed members of their country or attempt to migrate illegally to the United states and last Sunday I was stabbed blush or we should ... uh ... maintain our focus on the rule of law\nThat individuals who wish to come to the United states as refugees should go through normal channels\nYou know it's interesting you say that Harry because he was one of the things that I ... I Want to say I'd opportunity with a secretary Pompeo a interception on Tuesday for um a Andrew Brunson\nAnd um it was ... and it was a it was beautiful bent by the way and and the pastors expresses appreciation again to our audience into media outlets around the country that have have carried has a story and ultimately gun resulted God allowed the freedom of ah\nAndrew Brunson and the the you always look at it that way it's always the way I said I mean these are people released from captive um because of what the lord does and um there are people that are still kept and we need to pray for their release too and of course we appreciate everything the administration has done in that regard but\nLet me say this when I was with them you could tell in the state department and this is a these kind of issues are very significant\nVery very significant a and then you you take that I think to the next step here and understand that early intervention want to avoid a confrontation at the border and new to me that is the key issue\nThe whole idea is to prevent a clash that could be bloody that could be horrific that occurs between the United states forces whether it's the armed forces or the border patrol\nAnd these migrants at the borders so the thing is that we want to anticipate and intervene before this occurs thousands or hopefully hundreds of miles before it occurs so that it could be a averted as Harry has mentioned the news reports have\nIndicated the numbers of migrants have fallen to about half of the Seventy two hundred\nThat were originally said to be moving toward the United states\nAnd therefore there has been an attrition which is to be a really a\nWe're happy to see that this has happened where they've gone and I don't know we have no idea but at least it has indicated that there will be less of a confrontation because you've got fewer number of people who are attached to this caravan as it is moving toward the American southern border\nLet me play what a President Trump had to say about this and working with Mexico\nLet I Do is working with us there is a movement toward our country is going to be a while before they get here [noise]\nAnd his group that has around this table will\nBe involved and others will have a whole economic faithful come into the illegal\nSo I think look I we we were early advocates Harry of the intervention issue with Mexico\nOr in country there to see what can be done to avoid a border confrontation\nUps absolutely and that is highly necessary so one of the things that you should do to show true leadership is that you should anticipate problems before they reach a climax before the clash or ups\nAnd clearly we have had time we've engaged in\nPreparation and we've engaged in hopefully poop negotiations with the Mexican authorities to avert a crisis and it's important to know that this crisis was initiated at least in part by individuals left just individuals or in Honduras\nOr who's a basically\nInitiated this caravan movement a nonetheless the the trumpet minister ration\nHas engaged hopefully in fruitful negotiations to avert the crisis at us ports of entry and that is necessary because you want to ensure that the integrity of the U. S. borders\nIs a respected\nIn addition you wish to prevent crime ... ... there's evidence on the ground that some of these individuals in the caravan are indeed gang members they've engaged in a human trafficking\nAnd so it's from if we look at it this from an American perspective it's absolutely essential that we ... the crisis but we also ensure the integrity of the U.S border and that remains intact going forward\nAnd also utilizing the law and the appropriate way for those that are legitimately seeking asylum I mean the situation of Honduras is or if it can be people living on less than a dollar a day again we put a lot of a down there just doesn't with these governments that doesn't ever seem to get to the people that's the that to me that's the problem\nHaving said all of that I think we're a country of laws we need to be compassionate we need to be careful now this has done a and but we have to understand also that we better be prepared and I think we are\nAs to what goes on I Want to get our audience is opinion as to what they think the appropriate response maybe we'll take your calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten is eight hundred sixty four three one one zero let me go to a core Delia in San Antonio Texas on line for Hi you're on the air\nThat high God Bless you all in all the ... thanks a local ... when the question is what can the legislators day to close the loop hole of the ... the catch ... is there an emergency session that can be held stopgap Charlie ...\nReally is not I mean I understand where the catcher released the tuition is not really what's going to be able to handle this because I don't anticipate that what's going to happen here as ... fourteen thousand people or seven thousand three thousand whenever the numbers numbers can be\nIn the region this particular case in Mexico is critical but from Honduras in Guatemala is well Eric's\nAbsolutely so one of the things that we should focus on is the source of the problem and if we look at this from a global perspective or a broader perspective\nOn many of the problems arise internally within a Honduran government with the Guatemalan government with the el Salvadoran government\nAre they taking affirmative steps to improve the lives of their own people are they using the resources that they receive\nThe United states government and the American people appropriately\nAnd I think the answer to those questions because at the moment\nI'm no they are not a ... that's been seeing the interest of their own people so we should work to ensure\nThat the governments in those countries actually improve the lives of their people or indeed there will be consequences in terms of a reduction in funding from the United\nStates so Pam on Facebook asked this question I heard there was a second caravan which started in Honduras is that true and ... answer is yes there's a report right now that another caravan of about a thousand people has started making a point of exit out of Honduras oh that is happening\nOr as well pat on Facebook says it this way isn't deterred would set a bad president of course it does I mean you can't have your borders overrun but again I Want to\nI I think intervention here was smart early in Mexico I think that is the appropriate way that this was going to be handled I Want to close this segment the broadcasts out those turning back to the pipe bomb situation I Want to make a physician very clear we believe these are acts of terror\nSome people are saying they really are they real bombs we know if they're if they're not real bombs that would still be acts of terror\nSo let's take the politics out of this and and that's what they said these are acts of terror there they're designed to provoke Tara and there are\nFederal and state laws anti we've set it once we only got thirty seconds left would say it again it is a violation of federal law of course to engage\nIn acts such as this and it is also a violation of the law of every state in which these five bombs or\nThese these explosive devices are there could be aggravated assault that could be solved with intent to commit a\nSerious disfigurement volley disfigurement which isn't aggravated assault 'cause even rise to the level Jay of attempted murder\nAll right we're taking your calls one eight hundred and sixty four three one zero that's eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten we come back from the break we're for another thirty minutes you're not getting old broadcast go to Facebook parents go for a C.

calls at one hundred sixty four thirty one to let me tell you were talking about two things one\nNine or ... up a\nBomb scares and I think they do they look like they're coming from the same source or very similar source simultaneously indicates that they are I Want to be very clear I said at the beginning of the problem is that at the end of the program to say it again and let's take all the politics out of it these are acts of terror\nUnderstand that these are active during the ... they're designed to provoke terror and the cause harm and when you got it back you wait buildings and do the kinds of things that have to be done here you are guilty of that crime whether the bomb goes off or not and so far fortunately nothing has\nThat's right I mean this is a situation where\nAs we said yesterday on the broadcast\nThis should be completely condemn there's no place for this in the United states of America or we should have ideological debate vigorous debates and disagreements and our country a ... but at the same time\nI had to use this act of violence or attempted to act of violence to send some kind of message which it appears that this is somehow politically motivated I think to to not put those\nPieces together at this point I Would be absurd but that is should be completely condemned and I want to make sure it doesn't matter at again who is receiving it uh it is the wrong and in America the person who did this should be prosecuted where the people who did it\nShould be prosecuted the votes of the law that means a lot of jail time a lot of time behind bars because there's no place for this in America or American policy\nYou know we get ... used to politics being aggressive and it's a it's a full contact sport in one sense but this isn't sport when you start sending incendiary devices bombs or things like that to a of a group of ... any people in any circumstance but this look look this appears to be\nA motive I we don't know who sent it but there clearly targeting a group of people that have a political connections a political ties are known political people now we don't know who's behind it but we know it's an act of terror and this is again this is not how you engage in discourse in the and I frankly shouldn't do that anywhere but certainly United States of America\nI think you're absolutely right Jay terrorism in the broader sense amounts to the use of violence or violence or largely for political or ideological purposes or there are now over one hundred different definitions of terrorism I'm\nOut there but terrorism is\nEssentially the deliberate killing or attempted killing of innocent people in order to spread fear through either the entire population or a portion of the population\nAre essentially what ... or does it on leashes intimidation um and this amounts to a clear and unmistakable violation of federal and state law\nAnd the perpetrators should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and so all Americans should unite behind one conclusion\nThis type of behavior in the United states is unacceptable it's inconsistent with the notion of the rule of law it's inconsistent with the notion that we are a a republic but discovered by a constitution that apply equally to everyone\nHere's what vice president Pence had to say\nThese cowardly facts are just no place in American society\nI Want to
