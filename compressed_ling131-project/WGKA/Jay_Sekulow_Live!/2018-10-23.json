{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "But um what what I think it's going to happen if the people around the country are going to realize that this is not a deep blue state if people believe\nI was chairman for half a decade of the G O P s state party and we know by data and also by looking at our legislature were split halfway down the middle and so when that happens that's not an indication of a\nOf a deep blue state where a purple state and and\nAnd by the way and this is one of the important things that if you actually when the Senate race or\nThat could turn out enough Republicans to flip both houses of the state legislature 'cause it's one vote in the Senate and what is it one one now yeah both and so what would change one seat there and then makes a a world of difference I'm Sorry go ahead is on it\nLately right if we have our voters vote all the way up and down the ballot or\nThat is exactly what's going to happen and the other thing that people don't realize is there an awful lot of good Democrats who have become very disenchanted with their party there not socialists they don't want this new vision that it's been so articulated by the Seattle's city council\nA lot of your listeners around the country heard about that head tax that they pass\nAnd ah we were ridiculed across the country for it because they were going to fight homelessness by basically forcing employers to lay people off because they couldn't afford to pay this hadn't tax to the city and that's the kind of crazy ridiculous taxation that people in this state are fed up with\nAnd and your opponent is on record of wanting higher tax rates\nAbsolutely and she voted against the tax cuts in jobs bill she said she would rescinded\nA there is like all these big government Democrats there is not attack they don't love it's another way to get people's money and the people in this country are seeing a new way and that\nThanks to Donald Trump kind of doing with his policies are what hasn't been done in a very long time and I particularly loved in our state and across the country that\nUnemployment rates are so low for our ethnic and minority communities\nAnd um I again you're you're running a very vigorous campaign you're out there all the time you you can't match I'm Maria in terms of money I mean she's been there three full terms in the U.S Senate\nUm what's what would be your first priority if you actually win this thing\nWell we have a lot of priorities in this state and a\nLot of people may not realize that we were inundated with forest fire smoke based on very bad policy if they keep us from clearing out the under brush and getting rid of that tender at it's ready to explode the moment there's a forest fire we have had catastrophic forest fires in our federal for us\nAnd that's got to change and that is one of the first things I Would do another thing is we are really hurting when it comes to transportation and because our state is so\nPoorly respected in the halls of power we have very little cloud to bring home any kind of money from the federal government and I said I can bring home that the federal dollars for infrastructure that my opponent has been unable to do\nWas harshly because he can work with the Trump admitted to directly and and but also partially because I think you share with the Trump Administration to desire to move us to fixing our roads rather than building new choo choo train those are friends ... yes a that actually go nowhere\nExactly you know we're on the cusp of a very exciting time in transportation a cleaner cars and and the ability to use a\nA phone app to find a drivers and writers in order to a\nDouble and triple up in car pools like we've never seen before you know kind of an ... version of transportation for the community and there are so many new innovative things that are coming down the road it's just a shame to use the phrase it's just a shame that we spend so much time wasting billions of dollars on a\nOn not getting our folks to and from work and back home to visit with their families for the rest of the day so I'm I feel very strongly about it there's there's another thing that really affects all of that and this is nationwide it's bringing down the cost of higher education\nAnd we know the federal government has had a major role in increasing those costs and uh we've got to step in the time has come and it's an issue that I think all of that around the country are going to be working on\nAnd what are what are some of the promising ways you could bring down the ridiculous cost of higher education well the\nThe biggest one is that a federal use of of loans or that has allowed the costs at the university is to go skyrocketing\nNo of course with the federal government under writing all all of these loans including for people who just go for a year or two and don't even have a college degree to show for it we're

finished her second and final debate with her opponent senator Maria Cantwell US Senator from the state of Washington\nAnd you did very well and both of those sessions and part of the reason you do well as you are very credible on the issue of national security now I gotta say\nYour dad was a Lieutenant General in the air force your husband is a colonel in the marine corps and I didn't realize that you have a son now is the second lieutenant and Marine Corps um what do you think about the national security implications of this now very famous caravan that is heading toward our southern border\nWell we have tested in polling over the last several months and uh our voters believe that immigration is the number one issue in America and even though we're up here in this northwest corner of the country they really care about it because it is a national security issue and uh\nSo the people that I talk to you it doesn't matter what party there and they're deeply concerned about what the implications are ... thousands of people storming our southern border it's a frightening thought\nWorrying about what your pets might do in your home and just love what they bring to your life\nAnd knocking it or\nI Try to answer whether\nWe've got a cooler fall night out there tonight with clear skies and that I'm forty six and a little bit of wind later on the evening when they looking pretty good things are warming up sending sky high have any way from ... and ... now\nLive from the AM nine twenty the answers studios and butthead it's sixty seven degrees [noise]\nAnd [noise]\nUm ... some call it an attempt to note invasion let me tell you what the president is that\nYou want\nTo come into our we have a three point seven percent unemployment so is this better more than fifty\n\nSo that's what the president said he's declared it a basically a a national emergency but there is an interesting issue here and I want to\nPoint this out uh we had an interesting comment come in on Facebook or that I wanted to have met a west address because he made his point already and then as soon as you know Facebook said how can the mixing the thirties deal with the caravan of this size and as soon as a go ahead what's got him when you said really important\nYeah well they sent down five hundred Mexican federal police to try and stop them at the southern border of Mexico and they were incapable of doing that was going to happen is if this crowd of people thousands of people are allowed to come to our border as our own border patrol is overwhelmed and they will be\nThe drug cartels and the human traffickers who use are porous border on a daily basis\nThey will take advantage of this distraction with our border patrol being ... um you know over power distracted\nAnd they will use other crossings to continue their drug trade and to continue the human trafficking that goes on there so they will take full advantage of our own border patrol being overwhelmed there's no way the president border agents we have can handle a crowd of this size\nSo Harry let me ask you this let's get we're going to take some calls him over here but let's talk about a policy standpoint what do you do if the person the United states and the governors of these states on the border if there is they rushed to the border well further may well be\nFirst whatever the administration does and whatever those are state governors do must be done in a carefully calibrated and morally defensible manner\nAt the same time be over all objective ought to be to defend our borders\nIt's important to note that defending America's borders used to be a bi partisan activity of America's borders were strongly defended in the past by President Obama by ... a secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nBut today it seems like there is only one party that is interested in protecting the American people from an invasion of individuals\nWhich includes drug smuggling and human smuggling and human well actually\nI'm Sorry to hear the last thing that we want to see\nIs a mass brutal slaughter at the border that's the last\nVision in my mind and the terrifying a vision that I see something like that is something that we don't want to see fire opening up on these people because some of them are legitimate asylum seekers and they're being used by and they're being manipulated this is a manipulation of the governments of these countries and that's\nThe last thing that we want to see but it is border control that is absolutely necessary how do you do that and and in these very\nChallenging wave that you see coming in is the question you have to be answered\nAll right let's go ahead and take a phone call we've got Robert calling from Detroit Michigan on line one Hi Robert\n[noise] how ... how are you know LBJ Vietnam you know I mean he everybody every as as a crisis if somebody gets hurt it's going to be all over and you know the reason like Guatemala and Mexico and they really can't stop it is because the very reason why\nYou know all of our police and out\nBecause you know that it was only get hurt and so you know\nHere's the problem here is a problem Robert ... the problem is and I I think it would end he said his right you cannot\nAuthor I mean unless there was fire on coming at you you're not going to authorize firearm approach here so I mean I don't know\nAnd this is a it is a very serious political issue it is a very ... serious human issue it's a very serious national security issue that is what we're looking at here\nAnd west when you look at you know you had to deal with this in the military when you went to border regions\nYou know most countries are pretty tough on the border we haven't been but this is going to this is ... ... can become a as a president said is a national emergency ready because it's almost like an approaching\nThey call it a care of and whenever you get you some magic fourteen thousand people that's the right number of some of them Mexican media sources are saying where where do you end up saying seven thousand Mexican media sources are saying fourteen thousand\nBut the ... that can be very dangerous and very hard to deal with\nYeah absolutely it is a national security issue for the reasons you just mentioned also it is a fact that out of the tens of thousands of people that are intercepted crossing the border illegally and those only the ones that the border patrol catches\nHundreds of them every year or also from the middle east and they passed themself off as being Hispanic and uh you know the the president in saying this is a national emergency has said he's going to send the military I'm assuming by that he means the active duty forces to that\n... what that would mean what would that look like ... or call you colonel Smith when we talk about the military what does that look like Carl Smith\nWell you know the his critics will say well he can't do that because of the ... of Eighteen Seventy eight that actually was at the end of reconstruction following the American civil war the act is very clear and says you cannot use\nFederal military to enforce domestic laws and policies\nBut by the president I think rightfully seeing this as a national security issue\nIs no longer a domestic issue it's a matter of protecting our borders protecting the homeland so I think he will kicking be justified if he chooses to do this in sending active duty military troops to the border but then the question becomes as you alluded to Jay what do you do with them\nWe are not going to authorize it will be a horrible thing to authorize and it wouldn't it won't happen to to use live fire against people trying to cross the border illegally and yet at the same time\nYou put soldiers on that border the border is a violent region border patrol agents are routinely attack many of them killed from time to time so are you going to put us soldiers without ammunition on the border to stop me from crossing and at the same time put the same soldiers' lives at risk\nThere is not a good answer uh as far as how to handle this\nLet me go to Kim was calling from Arizona she's on line to like him\nThere and thanks for taking my call my girls can isn't it true for the catch and release program is going to allow the woman with their children to automatically become are able to come into the country\nYou're talking about through this caravan yeah\nYeah so I don't think we know the answer to that I don't know what the I'm\nA I'm sure they're looking I Know I Know what's happening I mean we all know what's happening there looking at Andy here you have a ... various scenarios you want to stay away from anything that looks like a conflict but under a hundred and he's done very sympathetic for people in in in in flight and people that are are fleeing bad situations but if you don't have an orderly legal approach to this\nLike the way my grandfather came and you end up with anarchy and fourteen thousand people or seven times but rushing the border I mean it's going to be a horrific situation it I don't like the way I I'm trying to see how does that play not talking about politics how does that help anybody in the situation\nWell it doesn't I mean it's the sense is just on and think of ... and ... and his wife was alluding to or not down there to start shooting people and slaughtering Matt\nThis is the people but we want to protect our border patrol agents in our military and\nSuppose the horrible a scenario of cars that there is fire from the horde that is coming is fires in return we don't know the answer to that is our military and border patrol to be protected then firewood have to be return\nIf fire is initiated fire would have to be return that would be a terrible scenario but this is not the kind of immigration\nThat brought your grandparents Jay and from ... from Eastern Europe and mine from southern Europe into this country in the teens and twenties of the last century\nSo Harry let's go back on the on the policy issue so if I'm Talking to us professor Hutchinson how do you handle what could be an imminent I mean I don't think I think they're still ... it's not going to be a it's going to be days and days and days till they get there they don't give them a certain amount of miles a day but what do you do\nWell one thing that you should consider\nBut this would not necessarily a result in an immediate stoppage of the caravan thought we should consider a measures to bring pressure on the Central American government\nAnd one of the things that we need to investigate is how successful such pressure might be\nA going forward a particularly with respect to Mexico we've just signed a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada um that a particular agreement the text of which has not been fully released\nUm I don't know if there are provisions going forward or that will help us out but that does not deal with the immediate concern and so the other issue to be considered of course is too boring additional\nA country that's also defined by the rule of law which has has violated candies calling from Las Vegas and bought a high candy or on their\n\nHi Jay thank you for taking my call 'em you know a few issues going on here I've been watching the last year actually and um\nThere's a lot of and I know they're coming in from California side in Texas side there's a lot of ranchers about ... minutes\nHey it may sound inhumane to some people but that's why my theory at all my theory on this is Phil ... nobody gets shot or killed heaven forbid\nThere's a lot of ranchers in California and there's a lot of ranchers in Texas why can't\nWe have a few days before they ... they reached these destinations why can't we cake and\nNow we're not gonna look or when we're not going to do that I mean will because we're the United states of America so we don't do that\nI mean that's not the way you handle this we have got to utilize see what people are ignoring here is the diplomatic efforts that and if you need to be going on I'm sure are going on right now I was just that the state department on a pastor Brunson is matter but I could assure you uh I mean I Do not discuss this with anybody but you know there are diplomatic efforts going on right now with our our\nPartners whether it's in in in Mexico the counterparts at the state department\nThis is a national emergency but we don't round people we got to protect the border and I I I Wish I could give you the answer on what to do I'm we're not doing I mean I I completely think that the the last call was is was was I didn't even like where that was going on and I think\nThe ... the reality is what we need to have happened here is we got a look and this is going to impact world opinion on the United states to let's not being naive let's be smart [noise]\nOkay let's be smart it's in it's a seven to fourteen thousand person problem that significant which they are still thousands of miles away from the United states we need to be working with our governments in the region [noise]\nTo get control of this before we have a confrontation\nWith Mexico Mexican authorities over this because we did you sign a trade deal with them so there's a lot of things that can take place here All right we're here for another thirty minutes if you don't get the full hour broadcasts just go over to a C. O. J. dot org you can also uh of course was one on Facebook and prayers go back with more than ...\nAre you a responsible person to find yourself going deeper and credit card debt than get money for a

sixty nine Seventy six live from\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow lie [noise] and\nNow she's also for the American Center for law and justice of the secular\nSo here's what we have the president has announced\nThat he has the lord of the border patrol and the military that the caravan heading to the southern border is quote\nA national emergency that number of people involved it ranges from seven thousand that's what the domestic news outlets are reporting here but uh outlets in Mexico are saying upwards of fourteen thousand\nSo it is a significant issue a there is also a a concern I think a a legitimate one at both the ... you can be sympathetic to the humanitarian crisis which I get and I but you don't know who else was in these in these caravans\nMean fourteen thousand people I mean what you said earlier I think it's important to say it again what could be going on here from your experience and the military\nYeah as as our our people on the border right near the border patrol agents as they are overwhelmed\nA and distracted the human traffickers and the drug cartels will use this opportunity to go to other places along the border to fly their trade into crossing illegally you know Jay looking at this whole situation\nIt is a shame that it has come to this\nUh and you know me I'm not a Democrat or Republican but because of the Democrats will not work with a GOP owns a really meaningful immigration reform what the dams would rather do they want an opportunistic we use it as a political weapon instead of solving the problem\nThe problem can be solved with a border wall and we're more security and by having those two things in place you actually protect people who were coming across the border this is a humanitarian crisis because of the failure of of having ... immigration reform in a secure border\nAnd it's a shame that the people coming to this border earned applied there in it's a shame that we have not done more as a country to fix this issue I'll\nTell you something else here and I tell you this there are people that are legally trying to get immigration status in the United states of America right now I understand from a policy standpoint how this taxes our capacity\nHarry absolutely and so one of the things to keep in mind is the loser all need for immigration reform\nAnd it needs to be a bi partisan effort one that includes the American people in addition as you mentioned earlier or we need to uh step up our diplomatic efforts are in the short run\nAnd we should notify are countries that currently contain migrants that their unwillingness or to stop the migration ...\nRight now we'll have long term consequences on our relationship with those governments including Guatemala Honduras and Mexico and perhaps El Salvador so uh I think you're absolutely correct jak well\nI'm One of I Want to follow up jammed what Harry just said because Guatemala Honduras\nEl Salvador Mexico these governments need to start taking care of their citizens you know they get billions and billions of dollars\nIn in funding from the United states from the United nations from all sorts of agencies for these types of purpose isn't and so often Jay in these third world countries that money is looted it's stolen by the leadership and like Nikki Haley said when she was ... the way you know we need to stop giving money to these countries that voted against us\nThat that spend our money in ways that are unlawful that that that steel and it's supposed to go to the people said this humanitarian crisis\nIs being generated by these countries that are taken care of their people so that's why we had the caravans we need the wall but we need these countries to step to the plate\nI don't think there's any question about look I mean here's the reality of what we've got there's no one that's on this broadcast as not sympathetic with the plight of people coming out of these countries that are cannot take care of their own people that are misusing the resources that are given to them having said that you can't have fourteen thousand people or something thousand whatever the number\nAs of actually being rushing the borders of the United states and just open them up [noise] because you as as was said I mean you don't know who's in there and then also I I Want people to be thinking about the impact that that decision would have\nA if you look at the people that are actually going through the system for legal immigration and that's part of the problem here she got away all of this now everybody wants to avoid a conflict on to the border and I understand that we've got to avoid a conflict on the border\nBut we've got to figure out a way to that we cannot just be invaded by people we don't know who they are now gone through new process there has to be a process to this and this is not the law process to move forward so I'm sure the state department and the homeless feared are all working on this but there's a real problem
