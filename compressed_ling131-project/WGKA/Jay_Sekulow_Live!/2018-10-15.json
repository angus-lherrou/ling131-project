we are taking your phone calls at one hundred\nSixty four thirty one to tomorrow just as a reminder pastor Andrew Brunson will be joining us live here on the broadcast on Jay Sekulow alive right now see see how a senior attorney with the ACL Jay and the lead attorney\nOn the Bronx in case a is joining us in Studio and she was with the family are actually in at joint base Andrews when the plane landed in the Bronx ... arrived in the United states I was with him at the White House in the oval office when uh the Bronx and\nUh met with the president and other major leaders of the United states as well as with pastor Brunson melts in prayer but there were private moments as well ah so cc let me go first to adjust to explain to people what it was life or the Bronx is to finally touched down on us soil\nAnd it was overwhelming I was a very emotional moment I was I'm In DC the night before with the children I'm making their range meant for Andrews Air force base and um\nYou know when they first announced that the plane was arriving we all went out to greet the plane and at the door open and we watched a pastor Brunson and his wife marine walk off that plane\nUm it was I don't think there was a dry there between and obviously the children and myself um it was it was extremely emotional that's two years of a hard fought battle coming to an end\nThen he comes off the plane and and what was that experience like who was at the who was there at joint base Andrews\nIt was just literally has a three children and at jak one is married so son in law myself and then on Marines brothers so brother in law\nAnd then you make your way to the White House\nWe did that we had just a little bit of time I'm at injuries and then we went for the meeting I'm In the oval office with the president\nFairly overwhelming that when media that we saw on television or I've got out and meet with President Trump in the oval office it's it's a unique experience for for anyone in any American but what for what we saw me walking and there was quite a quite a group of leaders in that room yeah I just started that way to start that way\nWe actually did um actually Noreen patch trained her and the rain had a chance to meet with the president did separately yeah it's important to the right and so they had a separate meeting and the children and I met with 'em all the congressman says Senate and representatives that had worked so hard on that so now it's a great time to just think that and for all of their efforts\nSex ... was there on both tenuous air so all those people had chance to interact with and then they all went into the oval office and that's when then president interact with and enter and Noreen\nAnd we have ... some of the exchange you but I thought what was most powerful to see about it was\nWhen pastor Brunson asked to pray for President Trump and actually a nail down that this was twenty four hours or after he has released\nA from captivity in Turkey is under house arrest ultimately at the end with this\nUh bracelet on could have gone back to prison friday or could have been a taken out of house arrest in back of the Turkish jail instead he's at the oval office and he thinks a to do and humble himself as if they have said\nA to kneel and pray for our president who did so much for his release take a listen here's the prayer but\nDo [noise] for us\nAs always for on further from them supernatural wisdom accomplish\nFaster you have for this country and [noise] I said you give him with some relief [laughter] right [laughter] you'll get some perseverance and enduring thing for than\nTruth [laughter] enemies from your mind [noise] faster you make him a brave [laughter]\nWas your wisdom answering person [laughter] and we have you with us [laughter] Jesus [laughter]\nThat was it so cc you were there at the oval office already a powerful place to be witnessing a list experiencing it what was that moment like\nA ... it really I think the whole room I was a not at that moment that here in as pastor Brunson like you said he's been in prison for almost two years just last month or so in house arrest\nBy that his first concern was to nail down and pray for the president everyone in that room with touched in and you could see it they simply\nThe a pause Facebook rice said that this outcome encourages me even more before to pray for those persecuted legacy a bb I wanted to ask a see how are the Bronx is doing I mean I went to the world where to probably a lot of adrenalin flowing up but he was under house arrest used for a few months so things\nMuch better than being in prison in Turkey a but still that uncertainty and other ... inability to leave the house have the\nThe uh ankle bracelet on have just having that removed on friday and it but uh what is what is it this experience been like in the house was their their mood and what was it like to do with\nUh obviously there were over ... can be reunited with their family um he looks very healthy I'm very ...\n... and you know when asked about that he's he said I I feel good obviously because he's back on us soil and and with his children so um and I would say he would absolutely give all credit to the prayers as a people all over the world that had been praying for him for these two years that that's how he's been sustained on and been able to just returned his family and such good condition\nMary on Facebook right since she's emotional just listening to the description of his homecoming I Know he plans to do some interviews I'm a ... be on our broadcast march from others as well and people will get that information out for people but I Would suspect after that the family will once a time together\nYeah I think it's just you know they want they want to be with their kids and they went just some downtime to\nUh be a family and and be alone so um I think they'll they'll do these interviews and and then they're going to try to go back to just kind of normal wedding and and I know he had said multiple times that you know they're praying about what what's the next step that the lord would have to do\nYeah because it had been a twenty three years they had served I Know that they would take sabbaticals and time back in the United states for twenty three years their children were the United states\nUh but were raised their of it now living the states but after spending twenty three years your life working in another country um and that be your primary home\nI'm though the U.S is is was always you know their home uh it's it's got to be a unique I mean ... is Debbie rights and continue praying we've always said this before for these other cases individuals in these kinds of situations that we often celebrate and that is right to do\nAnd it's the right thing to celebrate their release but then we kind of move on and you don't realize that there is a lot going on emotionally and psychologically after you've been imprisoned in going through this experience of house arrest and persecution and\nUm you know they'd have to come to a new place in a sense that you were not expecting to make your permanent home after ... after living in another country for twenty three years or so a praying for the family now is probably more important than ever before especially\nOnce the interviews are done and and uh the the the uh the meetings are over with and uh and life has to try and go back to figure out what normal is\nRight and and he has requested that you know just prayers for direction that that's really a lifetime that he and his wife Corinne are praying for just\nIs what they should do you know how to use them and obviously his heart is still a foreign ministry and you know he has a pastor's heart and and that's what he wants to continue doing\nYeah he's only fifty years old fifty years old right and I mean as a young man and and I have a lot to accomplish with a young children twenty to twenty Seventeen\nYears old if you want to talk to some of the one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tenant just reminded the pastor Brunson will be joining us tomorrow or live on the broadcast or to discuss uh this uh this whole\nPast two years and then of course what it was like a two to come home as well when we come back to a shift in the discussion a little bit I wanted to give you this update this unique first hand account\nOf what our senior attorneys because of you who was able to spend these two years as the lead attorney on the case working with the Bronx and working with the family and then of course ultimately this culminated in this homecoming and\nMeeting at the oval office I wanted to make sure you got that inside or something unique for our audience because it was our case and I wanted to remind people that the ... for all you support the American Center for Law Justice\nAnd the ACL J. when we come back we're going to start getting into a ... a little bit different but very newsworthy is twenty two days out which is the elections so will spend more time with pastor Brunson tomorrow on the broadcast red done\nTalking about his uh his release and his homecoming the United states he'll be joining us live tomorrow but we do want to get into politics as well so if you got questions about the upcoming midterm elections you can start calling now one eight hundred sixty four thirty one time we will get those numbers will start to see those numbers out to you\nA sea of a final question for you just that the entire to your experience these are tough cases they're tough cases where everybody\nThey are and just like you said all of our listeners all of our supporters the people that find that you have to push and which I Love her six hundred thousand people\nOne to two hundred and forty of the houses four hundred and thirty five seats now there are some vacancies so there's only two hundred and thirty five sitting Republicans right now but if you boil it all down the Democrats need to flip a twenty three seats to get to a majority in the house of representatives and Jordan the historical data says that that\nIs a lower than average number for the first ... first mid term of president elect and the other party usually gets more that however the polling data we just talked about in the United States Senate that's actually proven true on the house side as well now obviously it's a lot more granular you're talking about districts instead of states\nCandidates really really matter and I would say a national wave is probably less impactful in the house that it is and some other places\nAre but I I think if you're the Republican Party and why\nIn DC a month ago you probably would have conceded that the Democrats were most likely maybe in a private moment you would have conceded to the Democrats were most likely to take over the house or Jordan I think most both parties would now tell you if they were being honest that there's a real fight on your hand this one could really go either direction\nElizabeth on Facebook writes in Jordan or polls dependable some more than others I like how real real clear politics does that they do an average of polls are she could see the latest polls but also you know what came out of four days before that\nAnd different polling groups um ultimately they just kind of give you a sense of a race is there a total blowout happening in in a race and then I should should resources be shifted somewhere else has something significantly changed\nObviously if three more polls come out ... Marsha Blackburn with a fourteen point leads instead of five or six point lead something significantly change in the voters that are being contacted by the polls\nBut let me remind everybody out there that mid term elections are all about turnout it it is very different than trying to pull 'em a presidential election uh\nAnd and saying you mentioned just in North Dakota for instance that Heidi Heitkamp maybe down twelve boys the latest poll and it might not be moved to a lean GOP race shoes the incumbent Democrat Senator voted against Brett Kavanaugh a lot of people thought that may be the end of her political career you said it's just a few hundred thousand votes that will be cast that day\nYeah twelve percent is not the same in North Dakota as it is say California only going to be three hundred and twenty five thousand votes cast or so in the entire state of North Dakota Jordans or just a few thousand votes or can eat into that twelve percent lead\nVery very quickly yeah so you see how\nGet out the vote efforts can take your ... from down ten [noise] in a state like North Dakota to to victory [noise]\nIf you if you got the people on the ground and the resources to do it the second half hour coming up we got\nPhone line over we're talking politics one eight hundred six day for thirty one to that one hundred sixty four three one zero we'll be right back on Jay secular life for all the information about pastor Andrew Brunson go to\nA C.

President Trump in the oval office was twenty four hours after\nBig fried and turkey the prayer the passer ... gave a knelt down and prayed\nFor President Trump or our senior counsel see see how it was with the Bronx and family and the time they landed at joint base Andrews through uh the oval office of their time in the White House joined us so if you miss that earlier the broadcast that be really encourage you to go back and listen to that account of what it was like from one of our senior attorneys\nAnd then shifting now into politics pastor broker will be joining us\nOn the air or tomorrow to discuss the experience or against so he'll be joining us live tomorrow but I Do want to get their politics and take your calls one hundred sixty eight four thirty one ten oh let's go to Rick in California on live for Rick welcome to Jay sexual alive\nYou're on the air ...\nGreat thank you very much for taking my call I really appreciate it thanks very\nUm he might concern with comments about the Republicans shaking a more aggressive about shifts in the polls is is that they're going to become lazy and lacks a day in terms of their approach to getting to the polls [noise] I'm more concerned with what do we do to get people out what can we do is local guys I'm a guy\nThat drives a scooter but it because I have MS and I don't uh don't pass anybody anywhere\nBefore I ask them what their stances and why is it a case who do they like in the election odor that like in the judge a Kevin situation\nI'm In in trying to a lesser early preached to them but certainly wanting to get into a dialogue with everybody I mean on the street but it seems like there's just not enough should be doing just a little bit more [noise]\nYou know it ... over to a lot of these depend on where you live so California's state wide very difficult for Republicans\nThere's a gubernatorial race there uh that is contested I'm not saying that it's not money being spent there is but it is very difficult for Republicans federally statewide um and then uh so you look at to grad school districts there's plenty of congressional districts it really depends on where you live but uh just to give you a a\nAn indication wreck at the tossup races\nIn the house include let me just count one two or three four\nOr five five different California uh seats\nThat if you actually six that if you move into leaning a Republican it includes a few more a leading democratic who's a few more I mean is there a lot it just depends on what district you live in a if you are seeing those kind of efforts are run by those campaigns because it is these are turnout\nElections I don't say this on the air to to uh listen I I think you always want to run a campaign like you're down ten um uh but you've got also got to you have to be able to encourage people to vote they don't want to feel like they have no chance of winning and the big picture to say it's a balance between ... between\nAlways feel like you're in the fight but also the idea that you can win the fight\nYeah California's a good example of this Jordan I Would say a couple of things first of all I mean I think you're right that you could probably look at more than a dozen races there as being at least somewhat competitive\nBut if you're going to if you're going to paint them all with one broad stroke you would paint them as seats that are currently occupied by a Republican but in traditionally Democrat territory and I I Would wager that probably eight or ten of those districts that you rattled off\nMeat that criteria to get a Republican that either running for reelection or Republicans running for election as he currently held by Republican but it's a district that is usually won by Democrats that's the dichotomy of it's going to be decided in this mid term election and just to the caller's question Jordan whether you're a Republican or Democrat\nAnd the reason that a mid term is typically one by the party out of power is because it is much easier to motivate that voter to go and make a change in the seat that they are casting a vote for\nSo I think it's natural that Republican voters us started behind in the enthusiasm gap\nBut I Do think that the Brett Kavanaugh thing really close that gap it's colors correct there's always going to be a disadvantage as far as the enthusiasm goes for the party that is in power if the party and that's in power though Jordan closes that gap in the enthusiasm gap is essentially equal going in the party in power is going to win that seat that\nYou know folks who got a lot to talk about\nHow we're going to take your phone calls wanting a hundred and sixty four thirty one time we got a couple of lines open 'cause we took some calls already on politics on the mid term elections\nFew since Republicans\nWhat many pundits believe [noise]\nThat would be the case of the house representatives\nEven keeping the majority of the house [noise]\nWhat about the U.
