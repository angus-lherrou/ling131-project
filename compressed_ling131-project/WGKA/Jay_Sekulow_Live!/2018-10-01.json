the focus on the possibility of that she's mixed remembering or she's\nMaking her memory that didn't happen yes lately\nThat's less than I Do the possibility of what's called the Charlotte gathering after was\n'cause there's no reason to believe that he did it because there is no reason to believe that there is no reason\nTo believe that your your is this it it ... it's a simpler world than you think it's not about your perception or mine or your politics are mine if somebody makes a charge that will ruin a guy's life we got to have evidence and if we don't have evidence to charge goes away

I mean right right\nRight the White House could make a decision based on the operating evidence that that there's sufficient evidence there that it's the nomination\nAnd he says the alligator in a harried the allegation on the uh I Want to get into the specifics of the what that allegation are but everybody saw him last week the allegation at the university\nUh event party at those allegations proved to be true which there's no evidence of and other than the one witness I mean that's one that's if that ends up being cooperated subject to review instill and is credible what do you think that does for the nomination\nWell I think the nomination is in deep trouble and I think at this point in time it's very possible to speculate that that allegation a remains a the most serious hurdles to his confirmation\nOr it's important to realize that we're back on Mitchell the\nProsecutor who ask questions after hearing suggested that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against judge Kavanaugh based on the testimony of the two witnesses last week so I think if there is some ... corporation with respect to the second allegation and\nUh that could pose a a real hurdle for judge Kavanaugh that if in fact there's cooperation absolutely absolutely huge question\nYeah and I think one of the most interesting things about Mitchell's report to the Republican Senate and she sent all the Republican senators and she said that this is a matter of he said she said but\nThis case is even weaker than that in her report that's a very telling statement about how she views of the witnesses that have come forward\nBut here when you've got to the Democrats are looking to stop this nomination let's be clear none of these ... none of the Democrats maybe but on the committee ... especially when you're talking about individual Democrats than a minute and on the Senate but nobody on this committee was going to be voting for cabinet before this happened\nAbsolutely that they'd already announced their opposition to him so uh and it's never going to vote no in the committee that we're going to vote no on the for the U.S Senate or there's a handful of Democrats left I think ... basically it's Joe mansion\nHeidi Heitkamp I mean I I'm not even sure who else pass that I mean because you had Joe Donnelly come out and say no no I don't know if the FBI change\nIt's possible that this FBI investigation has changed the mind to reopen a few of those uh a moderate Democrats or read the eye I saw a red state Democrats in a moderate like\nDoug Jones in Alabama it does this change his mind if the FBI comes back after the potential to vote or we will see\nBut so far I think it comes down to Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins maybe Joe Manchin\nThe is I don't think you get Susan Collins without Lisa Murkowski and vice versa I Can't imagine one of the voting yes one voting no so yes Joe ... she could be important to get kind of over the line with a Democrat and I'd have to have\nMy you see any democratic support right now do you think the ... and doing it\nOnly if this report comes back critically and that would be a an because of internal pressure and he would do it only if Murkowski and talents were there so it was already over the line\nSo he's not doing anything to get the nominee there I don't think he would be voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh let me say if if it came to him now but he's not going to make the calculation that way\nAnd he had he said I agree with Jordan I don't think you mentioned is going to be the one that pulls the trigger for Kavanaugh I think if he sees that the Republican senators Murkowski and Collins or going for him then you'll throw his hat in that direction\nLet's go and take a phone call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one said if you want to talk to us on air yeah let's go to Phil in New York are you talking about a little bit but we can talk to us off in New York on line one feel welcome to Jay secular life I feel\nLike thank you very much appreciate it very much anticipated my question my question was going to be is do you think there's any chance whatsoever that even one democratic senator votes for confirmation\nI think what they were just says right I mean imagine if he was the deciding vote probably not if it's already fifty one votes there he may because it helps them in the Senate seat how close is that Senate seat in Virginia West Virginia right now I Know it was\nI think he's looking to rock the boat there I think he's got an okay leave an okay lead a failure but let me tell you so you probably get your vote against a reward nominees recording I mean President Trump and um the Trump voters combat highly camp same thing you think are saying but I think not maybe not [noise]\nIt's all I think now they can all rely on this report but they will not be the votes to get him across the line so it's not like Heidi Heitkamp in jail mainstream become saving this if Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski vote no\nWay to get that going to be the the ... the the fiftieth and fifty first vote 'em or even if the forty nine fifty votes so that a vice president Pence could be the first vote\n'em doom and she's got a nine percent lead right now he says it so he's not going to do with the the rock that you don't want to get into five percent\nSo because it becomes a whole different issue for the national parties when you started dropping lower than that to he's right on the line of it should be a pretty easy race unless you awake in some Trump's\nBase there that gets so upset with you I don't know but if something comes back about him which is why the government is looking at I don't think that it ran away can face I think that the nomination get spoiled\nRight now man she does up by nine percent but that you know I'll tell you something that could swing down to five\nPercent pretty quick and I got a real race or at least go and take another phone call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tab Mary Ellen in Illinois on live for Mary Ellen welcome to Jason ...\nEveryone I question that this whole thing that we've evolved in saying and I've heard this many people that the FBI has no jurisdiction said why are we wasting time money and going through this again with the Democrats\nWell I ... the first of all you just said yeah understand something they don't have the authority to investigate it as a crime but any they do have an authority to investigate it as a background check\nThat dances is that's exactly what it is this is not a federal crime\nThis is a state crime in other words that is a state based if in fact he is a has committed an offense than it's under the laws of the state in which he committed these offenses allegedly but this is being done not as an investigation of a federal crime\nWhich it is not and cannot be but as a background investigation of a nominee to the Supreme Court and that's how he the FBI gets there a presence into this case\nNow that that what that means that this is not a criminal investigation no so this is not a situation where a file as an open at a U.S attorney's office and\nIt's ... visited determine whether he qualifies for background to be on the court\nAnd I think what's happening right now you've got allegations you've got to that they're considering they're not reviewing the one raised by Michael ... the reviewing the two\nNow are you got Dianne Feinstein saying the White House and the FBI should release details on the scope of the cabinet background investigation keep Congress important on any changes this needs to be a real investigation must get all the facts the president's just end the president said well\nJust starting to hear Democrats who are only thinking obstructing delaying are starting to put out the word that the time and scope of the FBI looking to judge Kavanaugh witnesses is not enough hello\nFor them it will never be enough stay tuned to watch what you did what\nI Would just say that she said well how did he die if I've seen him in and her own are going to react when I I think it's likely that in the doctor format or they're going to\nCome back and say they got nothing right so the prosecutor who asked because last week is right everyone's right it is a he said she said and she said has ... is full of holes including the fact that she never named him and to anybody until now I'm even when she brought this up years ago\nUm uh the for the first time in twenty twelve did not name the person\nUh that doesn't know how they got there doesn't know where it was has no idea has a friend saying no it didn't happen so\nI think they are never going to be convinced\nThey never were going to be convinced they were always a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh they're doing everything they can to buy time to find more dirt to throw more dirty I what I expect is not so much what comes to investigation even a because it this way that helps the FBI is that what else was going to come out these next they've just Monday\nSo what comes to that between what happened friday evening and today and what ... what are they are going to be other accusations pouring out or not if not I think that it's really just up the FBI at this point what what do you think what you're saying\nAfter they order the FBI investigation same Senator Chris Murphy of tweets yeah of course there should be an FBI investigation but whenever they fight doesn't change the fact that Kavanaugh especially after his performance yesterday is the most dangerous Supreme Court pick of our lifetime that I'm just saying so for the mainstream Democrat\nIn the party not the moderates not even the most live which is a major Democrats there's no moving that they don't care about the FBI report that was just a delay tactic like and he said to hopefully have more pile on something else or ...\nAnd uh and and this idea I mean uh Debbie said are they trying to get the judge to go through another hearing\nA publicly I think they say sure if it delays it I mean that's what I'm saying they will take anything to delay this because they lay it to make it a political issue of the midterms um they think that that's a benefit to them\nThey're making that calculation that this is a political benefit for Democrats to continue this process on I I think that it's the FBI's heads to an extent that does that do not expect whatever they find even if it's positive for Brett Kavanaugh to influence a single Democrat\nBut we also know process wise if that's what it is his nomination goes is that the Florida Senate now sit there for the ... FBI report you come out you've got but you've got to have released the boat can be\n\nSo good to have my ... yeah I mean this is we're it's about ... territory so during the break but for everybody was on the air right now I mean it it would finish our first half hour this is this is not like there's some rule book for this exactly\nYou know is the president just said in a press conference literally while we're on the air um you know they're they're handling this is how this is what the ... is requesting\nUh and then the White House has ordered and so it's the it's not what Dianne Feinstein is requesting that was what the Republican leaders they leave the Senate it's what they requested\nYeah we've got a lot more head we're going to be here for thirty minutes if you don't get the full hour the broadcasts just go over to Facebook periscope\nPot where a seal Jay dental work screaming at lived their television version of his broadcast [noise] and if you're on Facebook periscope and or other devices and other social media platforms we don't take any breaks we're gonna be talking about this during the break\nA radio audience course serious accent but a number of other stations you got the full hour the broadcast hey we appreciate your support for the ACL Jay last month we met our month depreciated that again you're supporting the seal Jay makes a huge difference of a the L.

Ramirez that's the Yale University allegation I'm not going to get into the\nTawdry details of that investigation but that's the two they're looking at they will either find cooperating evidence for those witnesses loss\nA cooperating their stories or they will not if they do not they're not going to say either one of these are line you know what they're going to say where we have not been able to cooperate but that testimony dust Brett Kavanaugh also in that case would not have been there's nothing to prove that he was making a misstatement or a false statement for the\nUm the Judiciary Committee and it would be drawn to be a vote on the floor of the Senate this week\nThe FBI could be done as early as today with that examination with that inspection or investigation but I think it's important for any kind of more former U.S attorney here to set up what this investigation is and is not the investigation\nIs that is intended to do make granular fine details from these\nPeople who are making these allegations with respect to a a judge Kavanaugh it the FBI investigations thrilled to see that's the name of the form number do not reach conclusions they don't say and\nTherefore we believe that\nOr we recommend that that's not what it does it simply sets out facts\nAs they find as the agent and they're usually two agents by the way who interview these witnesses not just one but two agents who go in an interview these witnesses\nAnd come up with a three oh two that they then give to their supervisor it is reviewed and then it is set up the channels and eventually will reach the White House but that's what they're supposed to do and I hope these field agents who were doing this do the right job\nAnd and our faithful to their task of finding facts as they are and don't do the things that FBI agents in the past on this program we've talked about doing\nOr at least go right to the phones Jennifer calling from California on line one Jennifer welcome to Jay Sekulow lot Jennifer go ahead you're on the air\nJake thank you for keeping that you're on the process by which I think it's going one of the questions that I have is any of that the FBI bringing out for their allegations there's no other further impediment on Kavanaugh\nThat's right so he's already cleared committee so that was part of the deal they will continue the investigation but declared committee so he's out of committee it's the floor of the Senate the question will be if there is no cooperating evidence of the allegations I think he goes to the floor and I think he's confirmed if there's cooperating evidence\nOf the others I think then and that that's a credible credible cooperative evidence then I think it raises a different issue wouldn't go back to the committee though it's still on the floor of the Senate yeah that's right I mean that was the committee really work is done although reporter probably go to the committee\nMitch McConnell could I mean this is a heated it back to her back but I I think if you're at that point\nThe nomination is pulled 'em that sign up to the Senate now they can inform the White House White House would\nMake that decision ultimately um uh we we've got to a well we'll take this we come back causes it about you know how the votes work will explain all that we come back from the break if you talk to us on the one eight hundred six eight four thirty one twenty a hundred six eight for three one zero but this this will drag out at least through the week\nYeah I think we're gonna be covering this most of the way it can be it'll be on the other news will cover it or the report may get ... you know bad the report but it's more there's a chance to release to the committees are and to the Senate and it's a relief to the public\nAnd if there's no cooperating evidence I think he goes vote on a boat now whether they'll do the boat Thursday or friday or Wednesday at the Senate will decide what to look that ... that investigation is winding down Clarence Thomas into getting two or three days what kind of in the same point here\nI'm going to go quickly around here to get everybody's ten second assessment ... cooperation of these witnesses he's confirmed I think he is\nAbsolutely yes I think is a very good chance of confirmation if if there's nothing and the FBI robbery anything you know what race I think changes as well I think it'd be no cooperating evidence I think Brett Kavanaugh's confirmed as a justice the super associate justice to the Supreme Court or the United states\nThe investigations ongoing so we'll see what happens when we come back we'll take your calls in order to save for thirty one said we've got a video coming up so well for those and Facebooking personal share this with your friends back with\nA moment [noise]\nTwenty manager traffic\nHere's your rafting in ...
