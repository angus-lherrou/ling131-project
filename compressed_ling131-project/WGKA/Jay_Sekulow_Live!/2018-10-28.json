{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "And now it is time some would say beyond time for us to move on to our\nDoes it have featured segment ... is our favorite segments you're my favorite site as Everett segment talking\nLiberty with liberty nation dot com and legal affairs editor and constitutional lawyer and regular contributor to liberty nation radio Scott co sense I have a scholar Tim\nOkay well the chickens are coming home to roost for Michael ... been kicked out of his offices for failing to pay rent for several months we found out that he apparently ... millions in back taxes and now the creepy porn lawyer and Julie sweat net remember her\nWho thought they could just throw stuff against the wall and accused Brett Kavanaugh of being a gang rape is free of consequences\nAre running up against the Senate Judiciary committee which is saying not so fast\nTemp Chuck Grassley and the Senate Judiciary committee has forward it to the Justice Department a criminal referral\nFor Michael ... Julie sweating it so they have said officially do we think these people may very well be guilty of a federal crime and we're going to detail for you the circumstances which lead us to believe that and request that you go head to investigate it now to him\nThe referral from the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee has a bit more power than if you perhaps wrote an email to the FBI had nothing to investigate\nNeal is freshly when the Justice Department is run by a Republican president\nIt is a huge deal to him and uh whether or not there is meat on the bone here in terms of a criminal act and you know in my very brief sort of look see at the letter\nBecause it it depends on what what they knew and what their motivations were a little bit if there are um if there's an investigation that reveals more it could I could easily go to ... why the criminal liability would attach but right now it's a bit premature it is probably appropriate though\nTo investigate and you know I think Tim you know you you kind of damned both a sweat in the ... in in that intro to the store and I don't know that it's appropriate to to dam is sweat Nick\nBecause laypeople are are allowed to be imprecise then careful in their in their words\nA imprecise artists have faded and well and gang rapes ... says\nIt's it's up to the to the lawyer to her attorney should have done a better job with her and he didn't apparently corroborate any of the ...\nTeaching himself because we know that uh and the names that they provided themselves to NBC News they provided for names of people who would corroborate some portion of sweat next story to people never even got back to them a one person said that uh\nShe said they had no um knowledge of of the events in question or anything like it and an an a and the fourth person said they had no recollection of meeting or knowing is sweating it at all\nI mean are these two are an Avon body and sweat neck wide open to a defamation suit I mean they they they tried to destroy this guy's reputation with nationally bantered stories about how we participated in a series of gang rapes\nTim I can tell you for sure that if if a\nMr cab if ... associate justice Kavanaugh was Mr Kavanaugh at this point right if he yeah he didn't get a get out in fact that he had to resign his\nHis court positions altogether than I Would be guaranteed we would've seen that libel suit but because he is an associate justice on the Supreme Court I predict there's no way and a million years he will want to go down that road he's won\nAnd and uh it's not gonna make anybody feel better to kind of relived that event for years which is what would be required to him and he worked to sue for that uh that\nCause of action you know it just seems that Michael ... things that the president is a pain yada and he can just keep breaking holes without consequence that he can just say anything and do anything with with no legal or\nThe other cars are glad you're wrong about that the consequences\n... is that he and his clients get to be rich and famous that's the consequence he gets to be the bell the ball at least when he delivered now given given what happened with his anti delivery on the cabinet thing maybe that's the tide has turned but before that it was more Twitter followers and more social media more he maybe he is going to be president\nOr the one thing I can be sure of Scott is that it's not going to end well for Michael\nI have an Arctic until he runs for president of course they are which are down there next year [laughter] you don't mind if dietary him as he is very much like Donald Trump all that well\nDonald Trump failed say real estate empire as one of the most famous man in the world he he didn't do it by chasing ambulances Trump is actually produce things he actually has buildings he has properties or a Michael abnormality what does she ever produced other lawsuits\nJudgments for his client every one of the clients that were wronged by a medical device and now you can afford a nurse to come and help you feed yourself then he's produced a lot for you\nWell evidently hasn't made enough to pay his taxes he owes me wins but ... let's not go ahead and had a great somebody who ah reject the union is certainly you're not condoning the I don't even say out loud ... taxes\nAnd then the Internal Revenue service by the lawyers for one of the Russian companies charge by\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's office over it's two thousand sixteen activities they argue in a new court filing that interfering in us elections is no crime at all it's an interesting statement to partially I just\nCame across the filing I'm a second ago and this sort of hasn't been written about very much yet but uh\nIt is kind of interesting that that was their apply in other words there was a dual reply right the first reply is arguing in a primary no crime has been alleged there is no such crime as election interfering\nAnd then right and then the second case they they they arguing the alternative if it is a crime or if it was if it turns out to be a crime we also didn't do it in that\nCase yeah so and the other case we're okay because it's not a crime and we didn't do it while I asked the question\nDuring the height of the Russia crow which we haven't heard much about lately you know they run up to the election was telling me which country and and what are your favorite questions right on the planet does not interfere right and the elections by trying to influence policy it's happen forever we're out of the worst\nWhere the U.S has one of the worst the perpetrators of interference\nMany examples of that threw out here\nAre the Wisconsin department of justice asks a court for prior restraint restraint of following a student journalists public records requests is a big complicated why is it important prior restraint\nAnd when you hear those words this is like a free speech advocates what what's the word I'm thinking of ah the lights and a glass of wine and yet uh the the classes were and that's what I was going for\nOf alarm prior restraint is when the government tells you both for you have spoken and spoken in this form would be a written a publication but you can't speak it is anathema to all his whole family in free speech and free speech law\nIsn't it like arresting someone for a crime you think they're going to commit or you're convinced they will commit but they haven't committed it yet\nIt's at uncomfortably like that for me and for the court where I Am who have you almost unanimously said ah that it's not one of 'em and in this case uh Alex ... is the name of our hero he is a student journalists who writes for the advance tighten\nAstute university newspaper at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh\nAnd uh gosh they got um there was a story about a professor who was a pulled out of class and then it seemed like such perhaps suspended from teaching\nAnd uh obviously that's a story of some interest of the students on campus Mr Nick was writing about that in reporting about it and he filed a freedom of Information Act request to get the records is about uh about his professors or\nYou know what happened and why this man was pulled out of class\nWell [laughter]\nThey inappropriately sent him like beat on redacted full story about this professors a personnel file\nAnd they they it was their mistakes the university went ahead and did is that the professor had actually challenged university to not even release any of us personnel file but they were entitled to some of the details\nUm pursuant to their freedom of Information Act request but certainly not to be on redacted files so they because of their mistake then went to\nThe Wisconsin at ... attorney general and said make sure he doesn't say anything about the stuff that we just inappropriately gave him and that is not the cure it certainly a\nA not good at all for the professor who's had his privacy rights violated but sadly the fix for him is to wait until the publication if it occurs and then sue the state and the university who has wrong to him\nBut not Mr Nick or the advanced tighten they haven't broken any law and they they must not Tim if we are to have free speech be subject to prior restraint where the the justice the Wisconsin the OJ filed an immersion emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction against them releasing this material to him\nThis\nI tuned coated GCE in\nIt is Sunday October twenty eight to two thousand and Eighteen\nI'm Alex Jones from Austin, Texas we have a global explosive right now we have ... the CEO and founder of the only independent probe free speech libertarian site in the world that allow social media activity and that gap speak freely is\nA there motto that we all know about the tragic events in Pittsburgh where Lebanon innocent people were\nGunned down by a psychotic any semi\nBut now entered ... who set up\nThat everyone would have free speech is being the platform losing fish server provider losing pay pal or they're they're they're trying to take him off line and CNN is spending more time demonizing Mr ... and the first amendment and they are talking about the eleventh that are dead and why\nBecause four minutes before this monster went in he said to the world\nThat he was going in as if that means Mr ... bad if somebody on a message board posted that it's incredible so he just off the phone with the FBI or late during the interview because he just off the phone with the FBI and I wanted you to be able to hear from him to speak for himself\nTo the world about what really stands for and what's really happening and I'm going to look at Twitter and Facebook and others\nWho allow major professors organized huge anti a grudge that called for the murder of the president and the vice president who call for harassing people in the streets of or physical attacks they're allowed still operate officially on Twitter\n... has done nothing like this so we've been the platform he's been the platform to big media with big tax wants to silence their competition they always say go build your own thing and then they come after it sugars requirement thank you for giving us the time the Sunday uh you've got a floor please breakdown what's happened\nOh thank you for having me Alex uh first I just want to say I'm heartbroken and disgusted by this awful attack this awful showcase and violence I've been praying my family's been in our community has been praying for these victims and their families and their friends\nThat's where the community in Pittsburgh uh with that said we've also been working with the department of justice and what the FBI very closely we've been fully cooperative\nAs soon as we discovered that this user is on our site\nOr we immediately archived all the data and proactively reached out to the FBI before they even contacted us within require them to give us a subpoena or research corner anything we collectively gave in the state is that they could work on their investigation immediately gap stands for individual liberty and for free expression for all people\nWe have hundreds of thousands of users from all around the world from all different backgrounds races religions beliefs are that express themselves on our site I Believe fundamentally that the answer to bad each is always going to be more speech\nIn this case the department of justice and the FBI now have concrete evidence or a motive or that they can now use in a case to see justice against this awful lobster\nOr we have always welcome to everybody and we will continue to fight for free speech on the Internet in the face of tyranny\nFrom the mainstream media smear attacks because for some reason instead of focusing on victims instead of focusing on what happened instead of focusing on a this monster they're focusing on job as a scapegoat\nGab did not kill anybody know social media posts has ever killed anybody I Know no I'm the only person that is responsible here is is the individual and I just think it's disgusting that God is now being attacked\nI'm being smeared my face is being put up next to this guy as if on the terrorists were receiving death threats and and and I hate on the Internet ourselves um we wish nothing but\nA good for the world we welcome all people we always have and we are all about individual liberty and free expression um we're fighting for the very things that uh you know those in the armed service fight to defend everyday as well and I think that if\nPeople can give their lives to defend these freedoms and liberties that we cherish I think there will be able to stand tall and take these attacks from the mainstream media this onslaught and this coordinated collusion from Silicon Valley to know platform us on the Internet\nIs not going anywhere we are not afraid\nWe will not bow down to the mainstream media we will not cower\nWe're going to continue to fight\nAn hour that people will propel us\nWe will continue to build whatever it takes we're going to stay on line I don't care how long it takes I don't care what it takes\nWe're going to provide a place where people can speak freely under the protection of the first and then in the United states without the tyranny of big tech without the tyranny of the media deciding what Israel is and what isn't and who can speak and who cannot\nI think that's very admirable and ... again I've been through this the plot forming a no platform process where they lie about what you said and done that I take your platforms away so you can't then respond when they all gang up on you and say you're a white supremacist or Trump paints all Mexicans are saying or a nationalist means you're not see\nAnd then that actually stirs up a real Nazis and people and and then the media basically them project them on to us but this would be like if this guy had called nine one one and said I'm going in or if this guy had put on a message boards I'm going into this guy would have written on the side of a wall\nYou know I'm going in and then saying that the wall is to blame or the telephone is to blame when you guys are basically a glorified message board where people can send messages or two people that have signed up to get their message is I mean these are digital bulletin board\nWhere you sign up and subscribe for a tax podcast basically is what I Would call it you're the you're the tech guy and the ideas are brass loosely on every channel cabs cab gab but these will be shut down these mean shutdown first they cover our shows then they come for again and then they lie about who you are an\nAn energy don't giving almost no coverage of the poor people that were called politically murdered ...\nThat's one issue I Want you to cover and then secondarily\nWe've got Louis Farrakhan with all his followers on Twitter and everywhere else\nSaying the Jews are blood suckers and Jews are termites and he has a right to say that I don't agree with it of interviewed Louis Farrakhan but I yeah but but but he hasn't been taken off and we're not calling for that but I Will tell you I Am calling for this a New York professor and others that calls for the murder of parents vice presidents the murder of police officers\nOr the murder of all these people\nAnd he's the guy directing people that are harassing a Ted Cruz and others in restaurants and he gets promoted by Twitter he doesn't get in trouble that's calling for violence\nI imagine if you let somebody say let's murder people let's kill people like this professor founder of group at a restaurant critic tweeted about dead cops assaulting Mike Pence here's his own personal Twitter's tropical hung up and dead saying we should be done for the Republicans and it just goes on from there so what\nIn the world is is it is happening here with a controlled Silicon Valley actually promoting violence and let it go for it and then projecting onto you\nWell it's every single day we see a thousands of tweets going for people to kill the president of the United states and this is allowed we see live streamed murders\nOn Facebook we see criminal activity in very high volumes across all of the mainstream social media platforms including ISIS terror cells and pedophiles preying on children and nobody is calling for Facebook to be shut down nobody is calling for Twitter to be shut down\nSort of take the the disgusting uh actions of one man and and shut down entire platform we have nine million people visit our site every month that eight hundred thousand years\nOn the world and the ... the the actions of one man\nAnd tried to effectively remove us from the entire Internet demonize me a and make me out to be some form of terrorists are allowing free expression and individual liberty on line for all people something that has always existed since the Internet's a inception is absurd\nAnd I think that people need to start talking about these things\nBecause if it could happen to us if it can happen Alex Jones and infowars\nDon't think it can happen to you don't think they can scrub your identity and an every mentioned in every profile you have Internet or if they don't like what you're doing\nAnd fundamentally I Believe that having more freedom I think more ... H is always the answer to bash each free speech is crucial to the prevention of violent if people cannot express themselves with words\nAnd and you we push these people into the shadows you know then they're going to express themselves through violence and nobody wants that\nI mean just two or three years ago YouTube Facebook Twitter\nLet the Nazis have their Web pages and they let the blacks the premise of the Hispanic supremacist have their Web sites as well and they're paying it allows you to call the violence they could be there I didn't agree with it a lot of um attacked me for some reason I'm a big target of the uh you know you're not season and then and we'll recalls the all right but she called me All right and that's well known a\nAnd and and and and now they take those people off\nShow that you can't go see that they're attacking me or attacking Donald Trump like this monster did say he was a global is the opposite of what he is or because he's friends with Israel he's bad\nBut it's that you get blamed ... blame Trump gets blamed a you know for being Nazis one more actually the opposite it's just crazy so just a few years ago all these other platforms still allowed some free speech\nNow they've gotten rid of it are acting like we are every form of speech but it's one of the message board and we have ... and the news will say look somebody said something anti Semitic here only it's a it's a comment section ... again they are by extension trying to end the platforms where the debates can happen\nWell I mean you just see all these other leftist sort of engagement violent acts as well and they post stuff on Twitter and Facebook I mean it's again like using a telephone or email let's say the person that Gmail or Google email and they sent an email saying OK I'm done I'm going into the synagogue I'm going to do it for selfish\nHow is\nHow is the email or a service to what we know Google reads the message is how is your liability I mean there are federal laws international laws the digital millennium copyright act and other sections that that that but to protect third party sites if I have a message board or I have a social network where I\nSomething like ... dot com then I'm not guilty for what people do is they're committed a crime then I have to take 'em off and and give it needs to be the formation to the federal globally and we've comply with ourselves so the idea of prior constrain\nThat you've got to go around and police everyone and control them is absolutely crazy and now you're being persecuted\nWell here's the interesting part you know he posted a this post I I think it was four minutes before the shooting and he said I'm going in what if I'm going in mean it's not like he said I'm going into ... to a synagogue it could have been on going in to the voting you know for all we know\nWhat what people expect us to do in for a minute right with the public that is not a direct threat in any way that I could see so I I don't know what people expected us to do in that amount of time\nAnd I don't know why people are placing the blame on us a platform that welcomes everybody and it's about free expression and individual liberty or it just doesn't make any sense we we know we have a a an alleged a person in custody\nI went to him he's the one who allegedly did it\nThat's right and again I'm going in\nA back when I was on Twitter and places that we were going to go in and cover something a right\nI'd say I'm going in now to ... to cover the event we're going in that in it and it's also fun Germany is this guy was obviously deranged obscene copies of the messages I didn't see anything they're open to that point said he was going to carry on violence\nAnd again IT law enforced will tell you social media is great for them to actually catch a lot of people for they do stuff because they're out there talking about what they're going to do and and and what do you think of everything the FBI share but you told me earlier today that they've actually been very thankful to you\nYeah yeah the the FBI and the department of justice has been very thankful to us they've been praising us or our direct cooperation our speed cooperation on the phone with both of them and emailing back and forth I'm In the past twenty four hours I didn't get much sleep last night and I'm happy to do so if you're a terrorist\nBeing on God is the last place you want to be because we are going to work directly with law enforcement immediately\nSo I you know this is the thing we love our law enforcement respect law enforcement God Bless everybody at the FBI and the OJ that is working on this case and we pray that justice is served as we will do everything in our power in our capacity\nTo help them in
