have a name now a just a name is ... or say Iraq I think I pressed that right ah in Florida someone with a ... criminal history or for grand theft back in twenty Thirteen\nOr he's been arrested as the main suspect in these twelve pipe bombs had been delivered so far\nThere were two more devices delivered a this morning I attempted to be delivered they were all and you know intercepted uh those two are going to Cory Booker a senator and James Clapper uh CNN contributor\nAnd former director of national intelligence that would just CNN again um the the so far this started on Monday with a pipe bomb at its Soros home\nOr none of these have exploded no one has been injured but it has caused a lot of tear member the evacuation of the time we're talking about the significance that the hotel with the office buildings with the apartment buildings with the grocery store shopping um with CNN located there I mean the effect has caused terror\nEven if these devices were voting\nOr just weren't built correctly or that would be a good thing that thankfully no one\nWas injured there's no place with is that our politics eleven days out from mid term elections it's certainly a puts things into perspective um but it does not mean we can't have vigorous debates and disagreements in our country or without resorting to not just violence but tear\nWhich is what this is is that acts as a domestic terror and the tempted uh\nTo to terrorize people and yet we condemn it to the fullest extent of so we have a name now a again of the suspect we know the location in Florida sunrise implantation Florida I'd up here's a vehicle was in one of those locations homeless and the other location\nA such a north of Miami kind of inland from Fort Lauderdale\nAnd uh and we don't know yet or if there were other people involved this is the suspect so I get it may not be over the president is planning to address this that happens while we live on the air we will certainly\nCover it I Want to take a your your comments a Nancy on Facebook came over to your phone calls as well at one hundred sixty four thirty one ten\nNancy on Facebook rights and what kind of consequences does a person like this face said\nWell of course the obvious ... and then most appropriate and prudent and proper consequences as he put in prison because someone like this is not fit to live in the society of human beings and they're locked away for a period of time because they've obviously committed or attempted to commit the the most terrible crimes uh and\nAnd then the worst scenario this could be considered an attempted murder because you're doing everything you can to to ah eradicate the life of a human being by means of an explosive device if in fact that's what it was and even if it didn't ah\nExplode the the fact that the perception of the recipient is what counts though the ultimate penalty here is jail\nYeah I mean this is again what we hope is that this will bring it in\nThis time period after this week in the United states of\nThese devices being delivered even as early this morning with two more devices so\nA total count at twelve but the postal service law enforcement said that they have\nNo reason to believe that's all the devices 'em and\nAudit by apprehending the person that will stop them from sending more but how many more out in the postal system is is still the question so you have to remain vigilant uh listen we have listeners on both sides the jobs is obviously a focused on a lot of uh left uh those on the left\nUm if you work in those kind of offices in in Capitol Hill or in regional offices for members of Congress or be vigilant you know is going through mail um if you work in the postal service\nBe vigilant as well or we want you to be safe because while some of these individuals are so high profile their mail get screened at special facilities others are not\nAnd they're going through the regular postal service so again I we've got to remind all of the people who could be in the light of danger\nBecause of an individual like this we condemn it to the fullest extent I think you put the politics aside because that may be their purpose or their ideological purpose behind it but obviously a something seriously wrong with a person whether it's their criminal\nOr or or just insane or criminally insane\nAs you put it all together or they should be facing serious law enforcement penalties that they'll go through the process but again this because the disruption they used to the mail service or the people who were targeted a very serious and now we expect that President Trump\nWill address that as well as ... will cover that on the broadcast if it happens while we're on the air department of justice is also going to speak to it later on today a show or taking your phone calls running hundred six eight four thirty one hundred sixty four\nThree one one zero we're going to get into a little bit\nOf this caravan issue out got Andy here as well as a caravan of migrants heading towards the border uh uh they are in Mexico now their looks like they're heading towards either a Texas border or a California border Texas border crossings closer\nThe president Andy yesterday's authorized eight hundred additional troops through a a General Mattis Secretary Mattis department of fish that includes that would that up the number two ah they're already Twenty one hundred National Guard troops there\nThat can increase to four thousand this eight hundred could be more as well so the U.S is preparing\nFor for a border uh for for this to happen at our border if it is not\nAble to be stopped before in Mexico but that is the hope is that we work with the Mexican government and get this stopped and dissipated\nBecause the numbers are still in the thousands estimates anywhere between three to fourteen thousand people that is a lot more than the last Caribbean we experienced in April twenty Eighteen so and so again Eddie I mean it appears that the Trump Administration is preparing for two things one\nPossibly are having to deal with this or their own and to try to get Mexico to work with us to deal with it together\n... as we said the position of the scale Jay has always been that we want to have an intervention prior to the arrival\nOf this a wave of humanity at the border and by that I mean the intervening with Mexican authorities to stop them to turn them back to put them into a\nCategory is perhaps\nIt was those who are legitimately seeking asylum which says really available in the first state in which you feel safe and the first nation who wish to feel safe which should be Mexico in this case and then faring out those who are here to do ill to the United states\nAre people who are not here seeking asylum but the danger those who are engaged in human trafficking and so forth and we're working with the Mexican authorities to do that on of course as you said Jordan and we're sending troops to the border\nBut the ... they're they're only to support the civil authorities and they are not expected to come into regular contact with some migrants if they carry arms is solely for purposes of self defense\nAnd of course the law in the United states currently prohibits through the use of troops in law enforcement routine law enforcement activities I don't expect that that will happen I anticipate and hope that they will not be confrontations at the border between this wave of humanity and the United states troops you never know I Hope it doesn't happen\nLet me remind you the president's executive order that was ultimately okayed by the U.S Supreme Court after many legal battles on up uh immigration and preventing a certain individuals certain from certain countries\nUh for periods of time off from immigrating or being granted visas to the United states there's discussion now being reported\nThat President Trump a one idea\nTo use that executive order because it can be expanded on the list of countries that use that executive order to actually shut down the crossing point so that our offices are closed there so that people who make it don't even have the opportunity to apply um that again\nWe'll call it that will cause legal issues and legal battles but I I Do believe that under that executive order the powers there for the president to do it it would be a unique way uh to ply because it'd be happening at the border instead of somebody apply for a visa\nIn the Mexican authorities would then go through that process about whether or not you meet the qualifications that we know people want to get to the U.S and we have allowed a\nI think the laws are not tough enough people to keep crossing through multiple countries\nThen heading to our border and then making an asylum claim and get and say well you know I didn't really want these other places I couldn't be safe either in some cases individual cases that may be true\nBut the vast majority you should be able to claim asylum in the first places called the ... the first place you lay it first place you touch footed that is outside of your home country where you're under the jurisdiction of a new law enforcement I'm In a in a new car\nTree and the new sovereign territory I can take your phone calls one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to remember our second half hour\nWe're talking all midterms are so ... and your calls about that as well eleven days out from the mid term elections will give you updates on the key Senate races house races how things are looking one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to that one eight hundred sixty four three one zero let's go to Roger in Virginia\nOnline for Raj welcome to Jay secular alive\nThank you thank you thank you all men\nFace Raj I'm blessed in what you're doing\nTo cause it to the things that I take your comments on it specifically because this is also\n... which is being used in horse is kind of an international checkers and miners\nYeah well we we know that there are a lot of our department of homeland security has reported that there are known criminals gang elements middle Easterners or people who are not from Central American I I just said and obviously those who would use a caravan like this to take advantage of it for bad and illegal purposes\nAnd are you talking about the disease issue there's this these are all issues you have to face\nIf it makes it to your border and you decide to open those crossings to process the applications let me try to grab one more call quickly before we go into our our next break Laurie in Arkansas on line one Lorrie welcome to Jay secular life\nAll right thanks for taking my call scale Hitler is there any opportunity for the United nations to get involved and protect our border\nI don't think we want the un involves on protecting our borders they they get involved where there are regional military conflicts like between two countries are now with two countries should be able to work together [noise] like the U.S and Mexico to deal with this so they're involved in Lebanon Israel border in\nGaza Israel is places like that\nAt least in Africa not where it's two allies worked together so let's not get the UN involved let's handled this between us and Mexico working together [noise] hopefully long before this caravan reaches [noise] our southern border we come back\nMid term elections eleven days away politics get your calls in one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to\nThis is a pastor ... just a Donald Trump under President Trump American leadership is being restored\nBut that doesn't mean our enemies have disappeared in my new book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no\nTake off the blind as a political correctness from the Obama\nSebastian Gorka his new book why we fight is available now\nAmazon and Barnes and noble [noise] live from\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow\nOut\nWe're going to get right into the midterm elections but since ... some people\nJoined us or just the beginning of the second half hour Jay sexual alive but me up to you with the biggest breaking news the day and that is that they suspect has been arrested\nIn these pipe bombings the twelve that have been intercepted or to some high profile individuals occurred and former\nGovernment officials ... some celebrities are suspect has been arrested or they again does that mean there's not other devices that can be out there still remain vigilant or the president is likely to address this if it happens while\nWe're on the air we will go to the president's comments but we do want to focus in on give you an update on the mid term elections right now\nWe're only eleven days out there is a you know we covered the caravan a which obviously has an impact on the election or we covered the devices\nObviously has an impact because the entire week of news has been on these devices are but now we want to look right into the mid term elections were eleven days out\nFrom election day but let me remind you of many places including my home state you can already vote many people are I'm actually planning to vote in the next few days\nUm so you people are already making up their mind cast their ballots a lot of votes will be in before election day so we're at a time period now in America where we have election day but it really is like a two week period where you can go and vote and convince people to get out there to actually cast their final vote for candidates that they don't want to start off in the U.S Senate\nOr because that is where it looks like Republicans are having to potential for the most games and there's pretty shocking news\nOut of New Jersey a Senate race there are pretty blue states selected you know people like Chris Christie there's been Christie Todd Whitman types and in uh in New Jersey\nThe Senate race there Bob Menendez is in some trouble in the race has been moved by the cook Political Report to a toss up that would be a huge victory for Republicans\n... be monumental Jordan I mean this is one of the races that you and I have talked about several times on this broadcast and keeping an eye on it because if it did move into a competitive territory it was going to be a clear sign that not only the we're the Republicans are going to keep the majority in the United States Senate but it might be a significant majority now pulling inside that state has\nIt in some cases within the margin of error with Bob Cuban closing to within five five points of button and then ended it\nMonday and as of course Jordan a bottom and then that has been plagued with scandal over the last couple of years ... has run a very good campaign he's a businessman he appeals to people that are maybe a little tired of the political process but the fact that New Jersey is on the map\nTells me that the Republican dinner or in a very strong position in the United states in Jordan as we've talked about most of the political battlefield in the United States Senate is in Trump or states that were carried by Donald Trump in Republican state that at this Point New Jersey would certainly not be one of them and yet it's impolite\nLet's go to the president right now he I Believe is addressing the issue involving the type\nOf that law enforcement has apprehended to suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise]\nCredible job by law\nFor us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find that person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nI was dropped it that's our days to spare no resource or expense and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice [noise]\n\nWe will prosecute them him her\nIt may be said\nWe must never allow political violence to take root in America\nAnd I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it\nJust like we have echoed and the president waited to suspect was apprehended to say we will not accept\nPolitical violence in America to do everything possible\nMake sure it's this individual and not a ... additional individuals as well prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law so there you heard from President Trump the announcement of this suspect being arrested but still law enforcement activities ongoing he's taking a very seriously\nAlso taking the mid term elections very seriously as well or we will continue to talk about those we come back to New Jersey is now a toss up\nBetween incumbent democratic Senator Bob Menendez a again a folks and this was a race that people were not watching that closely\nBut I Try to answer traffic\nHear happening traffic ... bones
