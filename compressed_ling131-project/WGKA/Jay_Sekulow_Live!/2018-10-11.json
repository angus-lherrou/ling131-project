main control in the Senate would you consider that a win for the G O P listen to a few weeks ago\nMaybe because it was looking like the city could be in jeopardy listen we're twenty six days out something could change that's why we're going to keep\nDoing these shows an update you are not every day but we will update you as we get closer and closer 'cause things do change\nOr that have an impact a few weeks ago it was like the Senate could be in jeopardy for Republicans right now it looks like to sit at a a is a is not that it is a pretty firmly in control of Republican series of factors talk of adding\nMore Republican seats I mean they have it it's fifty one forty nine so any kind of positive ads would be good now it's still very tight margins twenty six days out so take nothing for granted a because so much for that but so quickly in politics that being said because\nIt looks like the city is is we're relatively safe for now twenty six days out for Republicans a that it really the victory would be I think than\nHere they could uh maintain control the house even if it's this limits the marches I don't think I think keeping control the Senate um or should not be so overly celebrated a\n... it's it's it'd be great it's obviously important I think for conservatives are especially the nominations and things like that but it's really the house here at least twenty six days out\nYeah the Democrats chance in the Senate Jordan or a really long shot him and you're gonna have to pull off an upset and you know either tendency our taxes and then sweep all of the contested races the Democrats are defending I mean if you just look at the wrong numbers of the three five seats up in the Senate Jordan\nTwenty six of them are held by Democrats in ten of them are in states that Donald Trump won so that's a\nVery unfavorable math then I think the Republicans are going to control the Senate and I agree with you I think they're going to expand their majority there in the house Jordan um I think all the pressure honestly is on the Democrats day they assumed they were gonna flip control of the house a historical\nData says that you would their bases animated because they don't like the president by and large although I Would tell you in specific districts that is very much not true in seats that they need to win so I think they might be over selling\nA their advantage in that regard but look the pressure is on them because if if House Republicans can maintain evening one seat majority that's not just a victory that is a huge a monumental victory for them and honestly the Democrat Party or the the demoralization they would take place in that scenario during it's almost hard to describe\nThe here to me this is what is most shocking is the vitriol going into this from our former cabinet members of the Obama administration and attorney general member that such as the OJ were told not supposed to be partisan a\nEverybody should be able to be treated fairly and it's not really under even though it's part of the executive branch were told that really supposed to be independent of president shouldn't order the attorney general around\nTake a listen to Eric Holder on the campaign trail in Georgia\nListen to the words he uses the former U.S attorney general who is supposed to be the ... was the top law enforcement official for the whole country not just for Democrats but he weaponize that do the OJ case and that kind of language he uses once again take a listen they have\nTo use the power that they have gotten\nAll the wrong thing they want to keep themselves in power they want to cater to special interests me this time for us as Democrats [noise] to me it's tough as they are\nGetting painted as they are I mean it is they are but shallow he says these are all over my wife like really high winds slowly ...\nSilly says you know when they go low we\nMay go low we [noise]\n\nThat again folks where we've seen violence out of the campaign rallies or seen ... we've seen a again a Trump supporter of being attacked or\nYou know they don't see this kind of violent language is good for either side but for the nation's top law enforcement official a couple of things in a statement one he criticizes the other side\nYou know conservatives Republicans I'm for a warning power for all the wrong things and the first thing he says they want to keep themselves to power\nIf you really think about that if you believe in the policies that you want to implement of course you need to remain in power\nBecause you can't implement the policies you believe in if you don't remain in power\nSo this idea that they want to stay in power is somehow a bad thing though that's a good thing if you are trying to implement your policies you have to stay in power if you lose you will not be able to implement your policies second kicking people uh again this idea that uh we're going to would they go low Republicans are\nThat we are going to kick them\nI always that probably say actually kick them additives used say get verbally so don't you know but again people here that differently than Eric Holder tended it especially coming from a top law enforcement official but saying to me it sets the tone\nAnd I'd love to hear from our callers is well this idea that the attorneys for return Joe the state's tally a tally Democrat activists to kick\nThose are Republican activists or would they go low whatever that means and how they define that up and say that is tough tough rhetoric coming from our nation's a former top law enforcement official\n... it's tough and I would argue inappropriate Jordan given the political climate that we're in right now where threats of violence and actual violence have been taking place look I mean I'm Glad you made this distinction because our founders set up a way of government Jordan that was intended to have tension in it you wanted to have tension you needed to have power the idea was that the\nBest and strongest ideas would prevail but what you see in that quote\nAnd I think one that you might be playing up in many here\nIs not I'm looking for ideas to prevail it's looking for the preservation of political power at any cost and using any form\nI Would say including forced to keep it Jordan that is not what our founders intended there should be tension but it should be tension over ideas\nWays for a stronger government waste to advance the the American people and then at the end of the day coming together around those ideas Jordan a that sounds from Eric Holder or it perpetuates um what I think is a dangerous atmosphere we hadn't society right now and quite frankly you should be ashamed for it\nAnd then it gets even more unique from Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton of course can't stop or getting a getting involved in politics take a listen to what she has said she former secretary of state former first lady who lost the presidential election to Donald Trump take a listen\nAnd you cannot be criminal Whipple political party that wants to destroy which is an for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house formed or the ... started down\nSo you could only be civil with people you disagree with if you get power back ah\nIn either the house the Senate Hillary Clinton or you can't be civil with on policy disagreements\nBecause the way you describe policy disagreements are destroying what you stand for and care about\n'em that's not very civil so the only way to get back to civility is to have the Democrats take the house or Senate because they're really civil river Brett Kavanaugh's hearing really civil people all that other side of the aisle let me tell you I mean let's let's let's just stop the this is politics is tough but\nLanguage coming out as we can only be civil if we get some power back when Hillary Clinton said kick them is what Eric Holder said let's go to your phones one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tend to they don't want to contrast is in fact let's contrast and now\nPresident Trump uses a lot of tough language on the campaign trail he does and he's known forty tweets tough tough language as well he's passionate and and he speaks to the way this is unique or for any American president but listen to him last night this is at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania\nUh and and we talked about why he was there there are a number of a house seats there that are either leading them like Pennsylvania seventeenth or or a Pennsylvania six Pennsylvania five bought an open seat a toss up in Pennsylvania seven in Pennsylvania won Pennsylvania so I mean it in Pennsylvania sixteen\nSo a lottery is for him to be an eerie Pennsylvania last they take a listen to his right or\nYour family values and what kind of country you want to leave for your children\nThis election is about [noise] keep the America say the wrong\nKey ... around Cape May feel free [noise] than\nI guess Hillary Clinton means that you cannot be civil with the political party that wants to\nUh that cares about your family values or the country you want to leave for your children keeping America safe strong and proud free\nUh and so that you can't be civil with that and Eric Holder believes you've got to kick that down that message or that ... that's not civil I mean again this idea that if you disagree with the policies you must uh uh uh go to war not just in the political sense but in the end the vitriolic sits\nOr he also announced a that he would have voted yes on Brett Kavanaugh now easy for him to say that when he's not actually in the Senate or he he is a Democrat\nUm he tries to play very much to the middle now the latest poll that just came out from CBS a ... just a a this was October second to October fifth\nHas black burn up eight so I was a a a big swing but the other polls show that much of a much closer to some of the earlier post so it's really within the margin of error I'd still I\nTreat that as a margin of error race than uh the end and and even in North Dakota treated very seriously because um if you could hold on to Tennessee and flip North Dakota that's a big went\nAnd I would say just one thing on each of those races Jordan first of all in North Dakota part of the reasons that the races ... runs\nSo rapidly towards Kevin Cramer is because of how few votes are cast there I mean you're talking about only three hundred thousand votes\nA state wide in that race or a league can open quickly it can also close quickly Jay are Jordan so\nYou know the ... the adviser you would spend in that state can move a lot of votes in Tennessee I I really think Phil Bredesen got hurt very badly this week because while he did say that he would vote for Kavanaugh if you were in the Senate he also got caught or some of his staff on under camera a undercover video\nOr Jordan saying that that was a not actually true that that was just a political statement and then if you were actually casting a vote he would oppose Brett Kavanaugh so look I think he did make a politically motivated statement on Brett Kavanaugh I think that video coming out really hurts him\nI think Marsha Blackburn was probably the political favors certainly going in any way I think feel Britain is in a while he's run a good race uh Jordan I don't think he had a lot of margin for error and this was a pretty big air coming down the stretch and of course we're not\nGetting into all the gubernatorial races out there Tennessee does have one of those where the Republican is far ahead in the polls for the Democrat so there's a there's that also going that affects things certainly I mean all this [noise]\nAll these different if you got a\nGovernor on top of you got to sit on top if you've got lots of\nA contested races in the house level driving different kinds of turnout\nOr depending on where you live we're going to take your phone call second half hour basically it'd be taking a second that power on politics we don't always do this on this broadcast but today is that they were folksy one hundred percent on politics so give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one time we opened a couple of lines up\nAs we go through these important races can the Republicans maintain control not just of the U.S Senate\nBut even the house of representatives tough\nWe believe possible twenty six days out\nWill tell you why one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten will be back from Jay sexual I\nOwe you a responsible person to find yourself going deeper in credit card debt than get money for the toll free number that will put you on a path to financial recovery community debt management\nWill consolidate doing accounts and work with your creditors you'll save thousands and become debt free for keeps if you're a debt has you know we should talk called trinity at one eight hundred nine nine oh six nine seven six one eight hundred nine nine ...\nSix nine seven six one eight hundred ... sixty nine Seventy six [noise] live from\nWashington DC says you know\nYou're just joining us the big question today twenty six days out to the mid term elections and the big\nQuestion is can Republicans ... maintain control of both the house and is it\nI mean you may be shocked by hearing that right now because you've heard so often that I Know the Democrats are definitely going to take control the house\nRepublicans are right now twenty six days out that could change a teenage though you may hear something different for me but that's why we do the show staggered as we lead up to the election day\nA ... is twenty six days out it looks like Republicans were really just see how many ... extra seats they could add to their majority in the ... some of that is just based on how many Democrats are up for reelection out of the thirty five races a it is a twenty six\nAre Democrats so that's a lot of seats just uh\nTo to focus on and then you got to work on that adding a so that makes it just tougher mathematically and also the states hit of those states are in states that are a Donald Trump\nWon so it makes it even that much tougher which is why uh you've got a a leading a GOP leads you appear to democratic commit like Heidi Heitkamp I'm ed or you've got a toss up Democrat races in Florida\nIndiana Missouri Montana Nevada\nUh and uh the only true toss ups on that list or offer Republicans are Arizona\nAnd a ... in Tennessee and I think to this either started to see this move kind of a a with better polling we'll we'll try to see if Marsha Blackburn gets kind of a to point range or not a ... latest polls show that\nBut again that's a big difference when you've got that many of these that many ... will be so we'll go through all of it for you right now uh let me play for you guys have to get re sets the stage though what we're going to be facing from the other side's kind of leaders former leaders here's\nEric Holder he's at George you can't pay the when he makes this comment take a listen he used to be the former top law enforcement official now\nWe had a lot to say about Eric Holder I Believe you weaponized the department of justice that we're still see the effects of that is the OJ also oversees the FBI but take a listen to his political rhetoric all became Pedro yesterday\nThey have to use the powers that may have gotten him\nAll the wrong thing they want to keep themselves in power they want to take her to special interests me this time for us as Democrats\nDedicated as they are committed as they are the shallow he says he's all over\nMe and my wife like really high which will your hair\nMichelle Williams says you know when they go low we\nGo low we go [noise]\n\nI mean again he's talking to a Democrat audience but this idea of language like kick him\nAnd he had to go back to explain why didn't meet actually attack but we've actually seen people be attacked over politics and and specifically a\nA more recently spent the left attacking a conservatives physically or with politics in politics should ever or we should be able to disagreed vehemently a run very tough campaigns against one another without resorting to any kind of violence or violence or a rhetoric especially writers that generic just kick the you know and then\nTo Clinton she described what's necessary to get back to civilian politics it's it's pretty shocking which she were what she believes is required for Democrats to start acting simply get\nYou cannot be hitting all with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house formed a word that twin civility can start a down\nSo you can't be civil with people I mean she says destroying what you care about but with people who are on the other side of the policy\nDifferences from you you can't be civil you can only be civil if you're in power [noise]\nYou can only be so you're only civil when you are the ones making the rules\nThat's what you should be some I think that it's just again that these kinds of messages\nAre what put Democrats in trouble leading to mid term elections these kind of leader Derrick holders and Hillary Clinton should probably get off the campaign trail as a Democrat consulted that's what I Would advise get them off the campaign trail stop these distractions is bad statements we come back\nYour phone calls one eight hundred six eight four thirty wanted as one eight hundred sixty eight four three two one zero adjacent he'll alive prayed for all those who are affected by hurricane bike or not ignoring that we know they're dealing with a lot [noise]\nAnd I try to answer traffic\nThere's you're asking me path
