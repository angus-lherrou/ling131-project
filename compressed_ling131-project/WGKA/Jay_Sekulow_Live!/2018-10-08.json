writer\nAnd you don't hear here's my my partial response to that and I I think one of the reasons that for people like yourself\nWho have had severe doubts about President Trump this does bring Republicans together because the point is if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh\nHe is about as mainstream he's not somebody who's out there and we had um a fairly distinguished lawyer at our at our table who had been part of the Ted Cruz campaign\nAnd uh he was at our table over the ... and he pointed out that if you look at the names on that Heritage Foundation list Brett Kavanaugh\nWas the most moderate person he could have possibly picked if you look at his judicial record he is not someone on the extreme right at all he is a down the line like Samuel Alito like a Antonin Scalia he has a mainstream normal\nVery distinguished conservative so if they are going to make him a victim of this kind of character assassination they do with anybody that do it to you\nI I feel like as a

I think it took about thirty seconds after the Republicans delivered that fiftieth vote and Susan Collins speech that Joe mansion said he was also a yeah so it was essentially J uh fifty one forty nine margin\nIs going to and I think it's important I think this is a good call the tickets were while we're talking about this margin gym in New Hampshire as a direct question on line three Jim welcome to Jay sexual alive a gym\nLike or you know that we still live in a in a country where innocent until proven guilty quest to ski vote present\nAll right so let's talk about that go into what happened was one of her ... Republican colleagues Steve Danes who voted yes on culture and Murkowski voted no on culture and and now so she would be a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh or her Republican colleagues Steve Danes was a yes vote\nAnd would have been a yes vote on Kavanaugh his daughter was getting married and he's from Montana the senator from Montana on that Saturday if he had to he ... he was going to fly back\nTo vote a but out of a out of just the niceties there she knew that their votes would cancel each other out anyway so it wouldn't affect the nomination so she could vote present so she was still registering her opposition uh didn't but that is why she did not vote no she would have voted no Steve days was there\nSo it wasn't like she was doing a favor for Brett Kavanaugh she's doing a favor for her Republican colleague who was attending his daughter's wedding\nSo what happens so thin what let's take that that's a great was a great call Jim we're taking your calls it a hundred sixty four thirty one tent but now let's take what does that play she's in there for four more years before she's up for reelection they're already talking about Sarah Palin running for that or ... or a Republican opponent\nYeah politically speaking joined us at the same effect as voting no on Brett Kavanaugh Jordan's exactly right on this I think it was a nice senatorial courtesy but look if she'd have stayed a no and they had would've needed Steve Danes vote they would have just held the vote open while he flew back a cat that ... in fact if people are watching\nOn cable news or on CSPAN you saw the first time they went through the roll call Lisa Murkowski voted no it was only when all the senators had voted and the outcome was clear that she stood and said out of deference to the day and someone withdrawing my boat I'm going to be a president because it's not going to change the outcome and it will allow my friend to stay home in Montana but politically speaking Jay and we've got to be very clear about this\nUh she was opposed to Brett Kavanaugh she did not deliver one of the votes there was needed to get him over the line and so when she's up for reelection in Alaska that's the message she's going to have\nTo take back to voters in Alaska and convinced them one way or another that it was the writer the wrong thing to do\nYeah I think this is is you have a real fight on our hands and I think it it you don't even see them as well we'll get to go state by state the minute but I I think this is an interesting thing to me is I I think the Republicans are going to pick up the house or Senate seats I thought that was I thought that was before that anything is definitely an apple now the question is\nDo there was a blue wave expected to be coming and normally during the ... after the ... midterms of the new president they lose control if they had the control of the the house easily lose it I mean that's historically how do you see it here\nWhy see that in in the house specifically everybody's up for reelection so unlike the Senate such staggered or this is everybody every two years so everybody has to fit their seat\nThat they said they say there's about thirty to toss up so it's kind of the average or that changes though I'm regularly most of those tossup still right now a Republican just to be clear only to our or a Democrat or held seats are that being said the lean ... that leads you appear all\nRepublican and the liens them are a big about mixed so I'd say it's it's about this can Republicans\nAre just kind of maintain if they lose a couple seats I speak that is a victory as he's they lose ... as long as they have witnessed keeping the house control in Brazil are the head of the joy these if they are still the majority party in the house even by one or two votes\nThey want I mean that was a big victory for Republicans coming out of a coming into a tough election cycle and then the Senate what you'll see I think certainly is an expansion of the Republican majority unless something very bizarre happened at least like a less than a month and what do you think [noise]\nI think that's right I mean ... the Republicans have two hundred and forty seats in the house right now is a Democrat who need to flip twenty three of them and you know history is on the side of the minority party so I think that the the goalposts for Republicans there is absolutely just that to Eighteen majority and I actually think Jay right now they have a pretty decent shot to do it or in the Senate I really\nWouldn't be I mean I don't know what it is an average I'm gonna let you finish but people need to understand if they will lose ... house seats Republicans vow seats I think there's no doubt but if they can still contain uh maintain control of the house\nThat would be a huge victory for both the Republican Party the members of Congress had those committees and the president I mean you're going no ...\nNo question about it both parties are only aiming for that to Eighteen number and the fact that Republicans currently have two hundred and forty Jay they hold a couple of dozen seats there really a Democrat a heavy seats so\nThey're going to lose some of those but they're not even they're not name and for two forty they're aiming for two Eighteen and in the Senate Democrats essentially need a clean sweep jamming I think they've already conceded that they're going to lose that North Dakota seat so they need to take the seat the Republicans hold and in Nevada and Arizona and then really sweep all\nOf the tossup states that Jordan is talking about I don't see that happening J I think the Republicans\nAre going to have somewhere between fifty and fifty four seats in the United States Senate yeah\nWell it would be quite an uptick alright let's go and do you think well we'll get into that much of that plays off the cabinet or a process let's go ahead yeah Ruth calling from Colorado on line to Ruth welcome to Jay Sekulow alive Hi Ruth\nOh hi thank you for having me on and I just want to say to women out there that I'm a Democrat and living in Colorado we're being invaded by thinking that is not\nTraditional to Colorado and trained as a woman I Do not stand with the the people\nThat are speaking for me and including me in all their statement and I'm a survivor of abuse but the thing is I object if I'm looking at all areas listening to all media and listening not to sound bites at the full\nMessage and I just want to commend you on your job because you helped me\nTrack what was happening in these last week and it was clearly an injustice to women and its\nItaly and injustice towards Supreme Court into our nation\nWell thanks for listening was number one number two interesting I was with um a couple of dinner on a Saturday when it does have been I spoke at and I was where I was the speaker and\nUm he was ... and is now be switching the Republican Party I think and I'm sure there are ... now switching to the Democratic party but I'm sure there's either play too but it's interesting that this galvanizing moment\nOn the Supreme Court nomination that goes got so ugly and so overheated\nAnd and um with accusations of criminality flowing from centers or that it made up their mind before they were going to vote no anyways but to to make it this person I mean there was one of the I'm not going to name the TV show but one of the head writer is one of the evening talk shows popular talk show said well at least we we all ruined his life\nBrett Kavanaugh's life that's what I mean we're giving the exact words I Want to be specific on that I'm not going to say that those right uh what was it had right in front of the major shows and this was the minimum that was out there during this process was Israeli ... really unbelievable I mean really unreal\nYes and they're trying to keep it up you know Nancy Pelosi is now taking control of the so the house is taking control why because the Senate Democrats no they can complain all they want a but they've got a lot of work to do if they have any shot at all of getting it which by the way a couple of weeks ago\nWe were talking about a real significant opportunity for them to take back the Senate even the Democrats now I think they're just hoping to hold onto what they've got 'em to keep people like Joe Manchin within their own party or a or at ... even if they are still the minority party so you're going to see now and you've already it's already happening it's Nancy Pelosi\nYeah it's the Adam Schiff types in the house Democrats who are Brett Kavanaugh and say remember we've got the best shot and they do this is true of taking back one of the the houses of Congress specifically the house representatives\nIs happening in the latest poll so I mean it's really ... the the margin of polls still shows her with a smaller margin but if you look at the latest polls in just last week it's swung significantly I mean plus a plus plus well so that again uh you watch that closely because a resource battle it this way twenty nine days out\nUm ... you'll see some ads are run directly by the candidates some ads are run by a the DNC and its affiliates in packs and things like that\nPolitical action committees they will start moving out if there's no chance of of if they're wasting their resources that doesn't mean that the Democrat will continue to run ads because they've got their own resources this in Tennessee they happen to have a personal resources in pretty well funded campaign but they won't have the onslaught of of not just\nAs with people on the ground election day you know coming from the national party if the polling is continues to ... point lead so by a\nBy their their ... Republican opponent when you're not that kind of lead um again you've got to move on how\nDo you think this play during that we got a minute forty four seconds here how big than you think this place in the house\nUm I think is ultimately be deciding factor I mean it it will depend on in some of these swing states how many of these democratic members really really make it an issue but the M I n J just the overall tone nationally I think that I think Mitch McConnell put it right when he says the his opposition really played into\nOr the Republican Party's hand so you're down to thirty or forty competitive seats in the house I think it can be the decision maker\nAre wary and talk more about this we come back from the break we'll have our full panel with us as well we're taking your calls at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten that's eight hundred six eight for three one two one zero so we'll take some more calls when we come back from the break I think look a ... you saw the you saw the full working of the constitution last week\nA you saw the nomination process president's authority there you saw the article\n[noise] uh I mean article one two and three all impacted by this the president the executive legislator the judicial branch\nAnd um there was a multi phase attack\nOn bread cabinet it didn't it didn't work this time\nThey couldn't get it they were trying to get into base for which would have been the ribbon enough to mold coming out of those investigations to have people saying we need more time and then there was a round the clock out when the FBI did the investigation they cannot cooperate\nAny of the allegations made against judge Kavanaugh and in fact the ones that were raised by one of the other lawyers\nLate in the game a gotten a sweat next I think there were inconsistencies in her own statements that came out so just the evidence wasn't there to to move it forward and that's what happened and then you saw the vote in the confirmation will be back with more including your calls or just after the break\nHi Michelle milk and hear the gods now movie opens on October twelve dean came from the entire cast her job bringing the story of the big screen\nHow the woman goes into a clinic comes out that and there's no police report\nYou might be worried about the movies too scary not the mother of two I promise you can bring your teenage children flooring friends and family here we have a unique opportunity to change your mind about abortion don't know how Cormac\nGod's know is perhaps the most prolific serial killer in America ...\nThe G Thirteen fly from\nWashington DC secular old I Know she also for the American Center for law and justice secular\nShows I call it the pivot and that's the second place right now judge Kavanaugh is now justice Kavanaugh will here's first cases tomorrow as they support\nSo she adjusted to the Supreme Court and the United states and the we're now a less than a month out of the MIT terms and all of a sudden the cabinet combination becomes a call ... ... in the sense that you have some Democrats saying that they are going to if they get the house they're gonna open up an investigation with a possible impeachment\nBrett Kavanaugh on the other hand does it unite the Republican Party has well Supreme Court nominations tend to do that so we want to get your reaction to this we're taking your calls an eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten we've got our full panel joining us now a senior counsel for the ... director of policy a professor hurry hundreds and Cornel West Smith\nOur director of military ah fares are are joining us as well as a thin and myself in Jordan All right so let me uh we've heard from the three of us let me go to a ... a professor Hutchison ... he is confirmed what do you think it's the after effect of the confirmation well\nFirst it's important to note that despite the fact that a justice Kavanaugh has indeed been confirmed that the political fight or is not completely over so there are twenty nine days or to the mid term election\nA conservative voters are mobilized they're energized and they're energized for good reason the cabinet nomination in my opinion has United conservatives from all political spectrum\nBut be sure of one thing opposition is also energized to some extent and people on both sides of this issue are fundraising like Matt\n... no question about that so when you're in a group this weekend I was in a group this weekend a different parts of the same or I Would put everybody within the same a political philosophy correct with very diverse group\nThat was kind of the reaction ... here's what I saw ... there were at a table actually at the table we were at one of the couples that we're seeing with me and Pam I'm\nHe was an independent registered independent or had been a Republican had been a Democrat had been a Republican kind of back and forth this will push them into the Republican campaign said you know what that that would they did to Brett Kavanaugh so outrageous that kind of visceral attack\nThat he's you know this is just it just wasn't going to accept it and you know he was making ... what was your reaction where you are\nYeah very very similar you know that the ugliness of what happened the last two weeks is on everyone's mind and and the I think the consensus was the Democrats just made it much more difficult\nTo to take the house or they probably were never going to take the Senate anyway and in spite of the polls indicating that white suburban women are moving to the Democratic party and they were mainly against judge Kevin Oh\nI Believe that Americans in general\nAnd Republicans in independent voters in particular they were disgusted by the behavior of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and the blatant means steer spirited attacks from Kevin out\nI think it's going to be very very difficult for them to have this blue wave that they've been champion today overplay\nIt oh well they overplayed so round and round was heavily over played by Democrats the Spartacus I Would I think to a point where it was almost kind of so law that they were the only ones making news and that wasn't really going to impact the election\nThen you get around to wear a so that the Democrats really embarrass themselves in the judicial philosophy section of the hearing and then we get to this personal attack\nSection and and again what ... what are Democrats left with a judge Kavanaugh who had to go through a horrendous experience for his family is now a U.S Supreme Court justice they're all just sitting there are still in the Judiciary Committee um they did everything they could and they they failed a yet again I'm so\nThese tactics if they use a secret serious question when the and the people that they're aligning themselves with like you mentioned one of the issues is that what do you mentioned a lawyer by name\nBut it's like if you're going to start taking info from people like that um your it means you're not doing your your due diligence before you bring these attacks and if people see that you love your cat like that against someone\nCriminal yeah allegation against someone serious wanted that\nThen then it's the American people what question your Sears this ability to leave the u._s. government\nIs saying there I mean more like a twenty six seconds they're they're gone now right I mean everybody's out\nTo send it will be back tomorrow after the holiday okay so it's going to be interesting to see come back to
