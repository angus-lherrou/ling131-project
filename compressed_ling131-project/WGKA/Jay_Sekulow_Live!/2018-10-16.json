pushing a plan called the Seattle comments\nWhich would have been a terrific sixty one acre park right in the middle of the city where it would have replaced\nAt a a bunch of warehouses and very fairly rundown area of town with a great green space coming back from lake union and uh\nAnd then that would have been surrounded by housing buildings and office buildings in any event it was turned down in a city vote a right the same year that we we arrived we moved to Seattle city vote was incredibly close\nAnd but it was turned down and so now there are lots and lots of office buildings and that same area many of them by the way developed by Paul Allen's company Vulcan\nBut he built the museum of popular culture which used to be called the experience to music project he was a huge fan of

Sunday and took the day off\nOn that Saturday Sunday and Monday kind of took a day to recover and then did so many interviews this morning we're thrilled that he's with us a pastor before I say anything to you let me say with Pamela on Facebook says so thankful for your freedom pastor Brunson Andrew welcome to the broadcast\nThank you very much I Want to I Want to I think we're on behalf of our entire audience um let you know and you know this because we talked about this is where you literally had the world praying for you\nAnd the books that are listening to the movies I lose this broadcast every day and we're praying for you without the U.S seizing but can you describe for folks I think this is important for everybody understand you weren't turkey for a long time twenty three years what you were doing in Turkey\nAnd and what's your activities warden will will will bring your current but what were you there as a mission\nCan I can I first say something that we are so grateful to people prayed for us and we're so grateful for a field day a such a tremendous job fighting for us\nAnd uh the the uh high elbows tireless and advocating for us and you also J\nUh effort cc I Know she's a lawyer but she was also a personally involved calling Nouri and encouraging her and so many ways and a and you also Jay and we are so grateful that ACL J\nUh took this on and we want everyone to know what a what a tremendous uh uh help this was and then I was grateful we are too\nWell look we are thrilled that the result was as it was we got another case right now where do we have an ad that result right now and that is a representing is helping to see a Bebe in our office in Pakistan but uh your case ended successfully but you were there in prison\nIn Turkey and very difficult circumstances but I think is a I'll take a call in a minute here but I I ... for the folks what you were ... how long you been there and what you were doing\nIn Turkey what was your call to go there\nBoth uh we were there for twenty three years before I was arrested and our main goal was to uh go and preached to this Christ one of the main things we were involved in was church planting ... several church plants\nAnd then in the last couple of years when there was a surge of\nSyrian refugees because of the ISIS attack Syria a number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity not only to show the love of Jesus by helping them a humanitarian aid but\nAlso people who never had access to the gospel most Kurds have never met a Christian or in their lives and in Syria you're kind of fish the gospel it was forbidden\nSo we got involved with a Syrian refugees\nAnd we're a start at a meeting among them and we're doing evangelists unless that\nSo you were there as basically it's a missionary I mean we can safely say that we could not say that while you were there um obviously because of the situation you're wearing but you would they're sharing the gospel that was what your job loss\nWe did it and we did it very openly we we did everything they opened our churches were open to the public the ... um Misha worked to Syria's was all done out of the open\nBut before we take calls pass to run to the question it over those twenty three years any serious issues with the government or local or as a regional government or the national government in Turkey at all\nWell there are cycles sometimes are there more accommodating to churches into Christians are sometimes there's a bit of a a tightening up\nAh we had a there are often rather than from the government it's from a\nUh other people who will sometimes there'll be threats bomb threats death threats or we were attacked once in our church with a man came with a shotgun so that's always a possibility is that just does anybody who was involved in church planting a turkey can have those kinds of dangerous but it's not from the government\nSo this was this was in a sense a new effort to arrest you and try and one of the one of the charges was Christian ... nothing nothing like this ever experienced these threats experience we understand that in that part of the world but but what happened to you was something that had not happened over twenty three years\nNo it was an unprecedented thing\nYes so there is one follow up thing we're doing you know I said you're cases close and that's a great thing 'cause you're home and and and we're going to get into what's what's next for you but see so you got it we still one legal issue where you got to finish up with and that was the un commission on arbitrary detention ... we talked about that yeah be engaged\nOn the working group on arbitrary detention on engaged and they we present at the whole case he then they're still making their decision and then I have to know finalized with than what the question was what the court that he's back\nAn update family with actually that decision and the conviction and and what and release conditions where\nOh here's what we're going to do there's a lot of you called me I mean our phone lines are literally Jim Facebook comments coming in Eleanor says God is so good so happy the pastor Brunson history Christine says welcome home pastor Brunson you're truly here due to answered prayer so we give all the praise and Thanksgiving the gun I said that the beginning to broadcast\nA Andromeda Buchanan I said this and I met her I mean I'm I'm very happy with the legal work that was done by a team that was led by cc I'm thrilled with the work that they invented in Washington and government affairs shop and Greg ... who runs for office in ... and it just a great job and and and the circumstances of\nThat I was representing you and then ended up representing the president\nI mean you'd none of nobody could have put down altogether at the end of the day\nThese though I I Believe that with an ... to take nothing away from any one\nThat uh the lord was in this and that's that's how these things happen and I'm Glad that\nAh everybody I'm Glad for the tenacious advocacy by our legal team by the president by the secretary of state but we do also have to give credit where credit's also do you not just the way we feel as an institution but let me do this we we Andrew we've got a lot of people want to talk to you so you stay on that phone and we're going to start taking calls\nYes Karen is calling in from New York on line to Karen welcome to Jay Sekulow alive Hi Karen you're on the passer ...\nThank you for taking my call and I did find that ... and I pray for him daily I'm so thankful for prayers answered that he's home and I wanted to let him know\nWhat an inspiration his testimony as a Christian to other Christians throughout the world and on the light and he was in the darkness\nAnd I just thank him for that um he really inspired me as a Christian to um the mole\nAnd preach the gospel time there's that's what were called to do so I Want to thank him and tell him how happy I Am to hand him back in the United states\nWill do what you're talking right to um Andrew where where do you what do you say to Karen\n... are we are very grateful for parents prayers and for a number of people who prayed for us and we believe a obviously a God is is that people\nAre but I think that uh what was moving that's what brought our name up to this level or with the president uh was was periods of God's people and but I also think that as we look at it we think well we're we're not very significant or importance for our name to rise for so many people\nAll the pray for us we think that there was much more that God was doing and I look at it as a almost like we're looking at a puzzle but from the bottom side and someday we will look from the top and all actually see the picture\nRight now we don't see the full picture but God was doing much more than just using ... to release me from print prison\nA I think there was he was just pouring prayer from God's people into turkey and then to the middle east and that there is going to be a great harvest from this we haven't seen all of what all of the results yet but I think there there was much bigger than us\nI think you're right and again I I think the confluence of events that took place here was was pretty unprecedented I say that\nI mean because when we representing US Senate did know it'd be written a representing the president of the United states and then you had the the ability to use this platform that we're doing right now we're talking to millions of people in on Facebook compare scoping all these social media platforms\nAnd you're right that the end of the day that your your goal was to proclaim the gospel new you you're doing that you've done that and I'm sure you will continue to do that we have a lot of people don't want to talk to you we're going to keep going back to the phones ...\nLet's go to Scott in Colorado on line one Scott welcome to Jason you'll live you're talking to a pastor Brunson who's got\nGuys thank you for taking you to Jay and your team\nFor your your focus on religious freedom not just domestically but also internationally it's a great statement that this was making\nFive to two brief questions are first of all pastor Brunson how are you treated in the prison because you seem like kinda fairly healthy when you've got released I had no idea what to expect since you were there that long\nAnd number two are you going to write a book on your experience has got to be fascinated to to see what this was like from the inside of Turkish prison and were you able to do history in that\nWe believe in our prayer we believe\nAlso and and partition that as we pray for people God can\nA pass something spiritual onto a spiritual blessing on\nAnd so we we ask God to give it set up or to any one we asked the president and if we could pray for him he was very receptive and it was a great privilege for us to do this\nAnd say one more call before the break here Julie California online six Julie you're on the air with pastor Brunson Julie\nI'm In Oregon topped current current custom all that's why I'm a member of the hail today papers they care about one individual and they care about is is that the whole world\nAnd passed on her like question can you think\nYou feel occurs people around the world praying pretty well 'cause it's hotter than let's kill fair for them to court e\nOkay so first I Want to say something about it so they said they care about the individual and so my wife told me how cc would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us the hearings and then the next day goes through a whole day at work\nAnd just the personal care there was a really phenomenal uh uh the question I just forgot what the question\nWas should no no no the question was did you feel the prayers of God's people\nYou know I I was very encouraged knowing that people were praying for me one of the fears that I had it sent a rational thing perhaps but when one one is isolated the way I was\nIs it would be forgotten and that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that for her because I I felt very weak\nAnd so uh as I look back uh on my second year upon God was rebuilding me\nI didn't feel God's presence very much but uh I I Know very well that it was a ... of God's people that was a there was a grave coming to me that often was not felt like a hit and grace\nAnd I wasn't aware of it at the time but then I Would look back and say well I came through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was great\nYou know you're absolutely right and we're taking a break we'll come back with Andrew and pass arrange runs the moment but interesting statement\nWould you say where you felt like you were alone there were those times we we've had other cases where people say the exactly the same exact was saying that they feel even though it's irrational they kinda know into rational in those situations there can there be completely forgot\nI Will be back with more Andrew Brunson in just a moment\nPete's national maker will month at legal

we want you to be able to talk to a pastor Brunson um for the next half hour this broadcast as we do in the first half hour but I Want to ask you something here because I Know this is on people's
