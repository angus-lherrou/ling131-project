based on the alleged sexual assault of a teenager in the distant past it's based on ... years of judicial assault on the purported right to abortion in the near future\nThe determination to defeat Kavanaugh stems from the misinformed idea that any revision in roe v Wade would render abortion illegal in every state in the union\nIn fact even a full reversal of roe v Wade would give states more choice not less there is no chance that every abortion would become illegal just as under roe no state has made every abortion legal in the end Americans can only come to terms with this complex issue

notion I'm going to run this filling in for two and on her this week our guest right now is other McDonald's senior mellow at the Manhattan Institute is also the author of diversity delusion\nHow race and gender pandering corrupt the university and undermine our culture and now they're we talked a lot about race let's turn our attention to gender now and one of the most often quotas ... on campus one in five females will be sexually assaulted do you make it clear\nThat you are very skeptical of that claim what did you discover new research\nWell the fact is certainly not what the feminists tell us a what we know for a fact\nIs that there's a drunk and hook up culture that is the product of sexual liberation that says that there is no differences between the male and female libido that there should be no traditional constraints on the male libido such a chivalry or\nRespect that female should not exercise modesty and prudence they should be a sexually aggressive as males a\nAnd and this is resulting in a hook up culture of one night stands with partners whom you barely know sexual liberation said that would be great for males and\nFemales turns out it's great for males have a natural biological inclination to have sex with as many females as possible females respond differently to sex they they feel more emotional connection and they're\nLess prepared to just sort of walk away from an encounter so they often feel regret\nAh sometimes they're trying to cover up was infidelity to a boyfriend but\nThey will translate that and they're encouraged to translate regret into rape accusations if we were living through what these numbers if if the numbers put forward by\nThe campus rape and dust real complex or correct that would signify a crime epidemic that's really never been seen anywhere not in the worst African civil war certainly not in Detroit and and if that were the case if if there was that\nMuch sexual assault going on on college campuses uh you would have seen a movement to create single sex schools decades ago instead what you have is highly educated Gen x baby boomer mother's\nDoing everything they can to get their daughters into selective colleges you have now a majority of students on campus are females so either these feminists are not\nBeing strong women together and are simply staying silent and not ... not warning these girls who were to believe or like lambs to slaughter going into the nominee of sexual violence or it's not going on and\nUh when I look at the numbers again the numbers of applicants to cook female applicants to college the frenzy to get into college ah the fact\nThat there are practically no actual rape reports to the police I conclude that this is one big hopes\nBetter as you point out in the book and as you mentioned when you were talking about Google a little bit earlier discussion that a lot of what you are writing about focuses on what's happening on campus but it's also infiltrating our culture as well and some would say it's been happening here in Washington as a result of this\nFerocious Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight or just a couple of weeks ago you had Mazie Hirono Democrat from Hawaii saying this was the appropriate role of men as this debate unfolds\nExpect some men in this country and the men and this committee and many of them believe me because we all signed onto this letter to demand and MCI investigation by really perpetuating all of these kinds of lack of\nAction is a man in this country and I just want to say to the men in this country just shut up and step up do\nTo do you see that blowing from the mindset of that we see on campuses or is this more unique to the situation at hand on Capitol Hill\nOh it's a direct conveyor belt Greg you're absolutely right\nI mean that there were just sitting a mirror image from the notion that the so called survivors must always be believed I've heard somebody on the view say well the the males on the Senate Judiciary committee or not protecting women whoa you know that\nI thought that's what we're supposed to not have any more but again we are\nWe we importing covertly aspects of the Victorian age does because it turns out that it actually\nThe the notion that the male veto needs to restrain through norms of respect\nAnd chivalry was a much more honest acknowledgement of the differences between males and females and what we've got now and and so slowly but surely with nobody actually being explicit about it ah we're putting it back\nOn of course but we we do put males that double jeopardy all the time a week we want them to be protectors and yet we're still get a hold them responsible or we want females to have the rights of promiscuity and yet they get to claim fainting victimhood at at at at a turn of the hat\nI'm so there's a war on men in this country I mean that's the bottom line uh if you're a white male from here on out\nGood luck getting hired or promoted you're going to have to be twice as good as everybody else because the obsession with diversity the the the push to hire by race and gender is now\nAccelerating in every mainstream institution in the country and it all comes out of the academy\nHow do you define diversity versus how they define\nDiversity ah so I'm just say well but strength of America is diversity and\nLeave it at that are from a more traditional perspective yes we loved diversity because you could be an American because you can come from anywhere but you agree with the ideals that America was founded upon by personal responsibility and rule of law and pursuing your dreams where freedom of opportunity and all the\nThe basic freedom of speech and and religion or an association and so forth\nBut it doesn't seem like that's necessarily what the other is mean by that\nNo they definitely don't they have no interest in American ideals diversity for them as skin deep uh it's what's between your legs it's things that I think are are trivial that are now being used to\nUh to to destroy the extraordinary legacy of western civilization the literature music art architecture philosophy I'm home with ... may be a bad thing it may also be a good thing I I just don't think these are ends in themselves what what really matters\nIs are we selecting the best possible people if it turns out that the scientific lab\nIs all female and those females are the best possible researchers of Alzheimer's that's great who care but who cares I really don't care but if it turns out\nThat the best possible researchers to cure Alzheimer's disease are males whether they're white males or Asian males I also don't care either I just don't think diversity is particularly interesting concept\n\n\nYou know we've got so many incredible clips already playing today your radio listener I'll describe them for you but TV viewers obviously can see it if they cross the country ended in full wars dot com\nForward slash show but you've really got to\nSee us to believe that a mental illness on parade it's a bunch of people that have liberal arts degrees and then have degrees in theater I'm not saying that's a bad thing uh but just everything is like a bad junior high play\nMixed with a good dose of\nEveryone follows the same chance\nAnd it's just giant bizarre pay the parties and it's all about being dysfunctional and lying about people and then just banging on the doors and trying to open them and\nI tried to go get video of the Supreme Court building and it's the most protective building and they say even it was a White House I'm Serious and they run over usually in the footage of that she'll get footage of it and say turn your camera you can't take\nThen I talked to the guy said well you can type for five minutes but don't walk across the street and get near the building I was like five years ago [noise] show but they said oh we're going to let them do it\nAnd so you had over four hundred arrest the last few days last number I saw you got all the footage coming up today a of them attacking pregnant women them attacking\nOld people holding up pro life side that tends to trigger the most uh\nThe

Christians and veterans groups are conservative ... just harassing people\nThat they have no honor no ... no nothing\nAnd show their entire mission is the dominant control but ... but the ... the ... the number one thing you find\nA that they're involved in\nIs being professor and the biggest group of these are these crazy power tripping thirty five something professors who are I mean\nWe've got ours the video that our own reporter shot live when they see also divorce dot com you gotta excuse for yourself\nThan it is the most incredible footage you'll ever see of these individual\nFreaking out on anyone else's speech and saying you're not allowed to have speech and attacking people and just hysterically screaming ripe ripe ripe ripe right and so they so dehumanize people over and over and over again\n\nThat it's just seen as acceptable to attack women by men\nAs long as they're wearing pink or purple they're locked in a cult\nTook in the wash nice cult or something you know that
