worst part a majority fifty three percent in this survey said they often felt intimidated in sharing their ideas opinions or beliefs in class because their ideas and believes were different from those of their professors\nA slightly larger majority feared expressing themselves because of differences with classmates\nOn this question fifty four percent said they often felt intimidated and expressing

there'll be a very uh later on HBO ... the idea of birthright citizenship he's asked a question about\n... through executive order when it comes to a those board a from illegal immigrants so we've got a question company Christine on Facebook\nTrue George what is it there was for the illegal immigrants and undocumented immigrants it is a matter of choice of words the left typically likes to use the word undocumented immigrants is seen as more PC uh because uh\nAgain a documented the truth is what is a doc you to be the major illegally here so there's no difference I just try to use both terms because people\nAre sometimes hear one and say well maybe the other doesn't apply it applies to both because they are there to affect this they say\nThat take a listen to President Trump he he was asked have you spoken with as you plan on on on this executive order 'em and again there's different ways to write this executive order I mean we're just getting the very ... general statements for President Trump\nHas he consulted council tickle us by to be told that that\nTo wear in the process in the process it'll happen\nSo I mean they say it's in the process it'll happen I I Believe the focus will be\nA primarily on those who have no legal right to be the United states so called a document called the illegal who didn't have children and I just to give you kind of some statistics about that uh this is peaks\nBut uh just back and I see it was there's been three hundred Seventy thousand of these children according to a ... a study a so the numbers are kind of all over the place depending on how you define the term in twenty fourteen\nThere were about two hundred and Seventy five thousand babies tour Seventy five thousand babies were born to unauthorized immigrant parents so illegal immigrant parents that's about seven percent of the four billion birds that year US citizenship of course is a grant of over ... that's a very important\nThe difference between getting birthright citizenship it'd be naturalized actually has long applications for what kind of office you can hold\nIn the United states can you be president of the United states but also the rights of responsibilities that come with it or all emanating from one part of the constitution it is the fourteenth amendment which reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states and if the state of where they reside that is the big question west at Harry are you subject to the jurisdiction of the United states in a positive way when you are here illegally\nRight and you go back in and look at at one can versus art to Eighteen Ninety a case where which was the last time the Supreme Court definitively dealt with this they put qualifications in their decision that the parents of this Chinese American they were here legally and we're doing legitimate business in the United states\nAnd so what we're looking at and I know a lot of people just assume that his law that if you were born here no matter the status of your parents you're automatically a citizen while that is settled practice Jordan it's really not settled law because the Supreme Court has not dealt with this directly since Eighteen Ninety eight\nYeah I mean you look at it it really wasn't until the Nineteen sixties till they started becoming\nAcceptable and we just kind of said okay well if your parents were here legally that doesn't matter you were born here so you're a citizen\nWe're not really I don't think the president said to do to change this for lawful permanent residents and even people who are here temporarily but lawful a but instead for those who are here totally illegally without any kind of proper paperwork\nThat they are not subject to the jurisdiction there of of the United states in a positive way\nYou look at Harry the constitution the positives and negatives of law at innocence if you're here illegally if it it's the negative that you're facing as the jurisdiction and the jurisdictions as you can be deported but that the U.S government owes nothing to you other than the deportation proceedings itself\nI think your analysis is spot on first white citizen trip is tied to the fourteenth amendment the fourteenth amendment codified the Eighteen sixties six civil rights act\nThe Eighteenth sixty six civil rights are quite clearly exempted from automatic citizenship\nOr children of parents who owed allegiance to a foreign power\nI eat those were in the United states only temporarily and particularly those who were in the United states illegally\nConsistent with that analysis in Eighteen eighty four\nIn the L. versus Wilkins case the Supreme Court rejected the citizenship claim by an American Indian who was born on a reservation and subsequently moved to a non reservation territory because the one ... was not subject to the United states\nI'm a jurisdiction at birth so the key question is\nAre the parents subject to the jurisdiction\nOf the United states if they are not then there's some doubt as to whether or not their children their offspring are indeed citizens of the United states\nAnd lastly let me add that the United states is one of only two developed countries according to the international monetary on that allow or birthright citizenship and also early this policy is questionable\nAnd not only that Jordan a number of countries in the last ten or Fifteen Years have\nChanged their laws to explicitly forbid what the is predominantly called anchor babies in their country so that you're not automatic and citizen if you're born there and that includes the United kingdom Australia New Zealand France in India those five countries have said no no longer are you automatically a citizen if you're born here\nWho talked to us on the air what's your opinion of this the president doing by executive order give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tended how this could inflict [noise]\n\n\nImpact the mid term elections as well I think you can't take that away when you're talking about this city on Facebook that really gets his oppose asked is why I think it's a great question to individuals from another country come here to the U.S visit so basically tourist visa\nHave their child be bored here so they will be American says this is called birth tourism though the Obama administration has cracked down on this right now under the current laws yes you could if you came here to a tourist visa happened to have the birth\nWow you were all that tourist visa or you did or your child would be or could be a few so choose a U.S citizen\nBy birth absolutely so essentially what we've had is a deliberate pre meditative practices by some visitors to the United states to ensure that their child would indeed be born\nIn the United states and then they would take the child back to the home country of the parents so that the individual could later claim the trial citizenship and the United states and perhaps citizenship in China or Japan\nOr some other country it's important to note that at least one of the nine eleven terrorists a was born in the United states in the state of Louisiana\nHis parents then moved abroad I believed to Saudi Arabia he was raised abroad and then he came back to the United states to do was to terrorize Americans in other words he did indeed owe allegiance to a foreign power yet\nHe was treated as if he were a an American citizen or based on both like that makes no sense at all let's go right to the phones Linda calling from Colorado on line one Linda welcome to Jay sexual alive\nHi thank you for taking the call the lead to\nMake me\nWhen I sit back and I look at this I I feel it's very black and white if you are a legal to the United states\nBy type a measure that means and you're pregnant and you had a baby\nI Do not think that The Elders eat less citizen because the parents are not I think it's black and white if I go to the fact is avid ... and I think a lot of code I'm going to ... to ... and they're not gonna let me go 'cause I was cold\nSo I don't want to take anything away rosy from your family's experience your brother's loss proudly serving his country and it is his country that he served and fought died for it is your country Rosie to be proud of both the president's talking about is moving forward is this the right policy\nFor America and other countries in the western world have said no\nSo the United states perhaps along with Canada um ... is the only remaining contest\nAre you in the developed world that authorizes birthright citizenship\nIt's important also to note or that there has been a sky rocketing number of\nChildren born to illegal so in twenty sixteen the number approach four hundred thousand or that is an absolutely huge number and so policies have consequences and so we should see two to her birth tourism\nAnd this a proposal would as you correctly point out Jordan not affect those individuals who are already here this focal point\nIs on ending the practice going forward yeah uh and so I think I'm there is perhaps some unwarranted fears that have come up with respect to individuals who are already here the president has also proposed a\n... ... legalizing Selma illegals\nOr over time or in the ... with the cooperation of Congress or what we're talking about is a proposal uh that would look at new birth a and in this practice and I think at least\nBased on my legal research it's clear beyond question that the United States Supreme court has offered various opinions on that particular question going back to Eighteen eighty four\nI think this is what we can answer very quickly Larry and Indiana has this or a question for slavery welcome to Jay Sekulow alive you're on the air\nThank you I'm I'm a I'm a supporter of changing correct in the immigration laws of summonsed for the ... but I Believe it would have either have to be done through through a legislation and Atlanta or the uh the men that process for this reason these are using\nIt for for many years now that the uh the people that were born babies that were born even out possessions and states ... ... ... or a ship ...\nOur work instead of says to fire in the U.S code right\nRight second um [noise] it's so if someone comes in a way to take a scenario for male male illegal alien comes to the United states across the border and then does not marry but has children by a U.S citizen\nOf the child is a U.S citizen one parent is enough\nAnd that is to find also even if you were born abroad are there some time issues there but if it happened in the United states in the ... is a U.S citizen or one of the pairs than that child is a U.S citizen that is not an issue here on on what President Trump is talking about through this executive order we write back on Jay ...\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken

happen\nThere there you go from the president now I've focusing on illegal immigrants called the undocumented if you will so both parents be illegal or documented\nHaving a child in the United states is that child automatically a U.S citizen by birth it is now the question that has been settled by the court case\nIt is not a question that you could say is totally clear by the constitution or statutes because the statute on this issue when they took the constitution they put it to a U. S. C. section fourteen and one of the immigration naturalization act\nThey just quote that first part of the fourteenth vivid person born in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there of\nWhat does it mean to be subject to the jurisdiction of a southern state or a uh it's it it is a requirement\nThe were subject to the ... that means something that phrase so it's more than just be bored in the United states that phrase subject to the jurisdiction there of his there for a reason both in the constitution the fourteenth amendment in the statutes that followed that\nHas a meaty how far does is what is an issue here\nUh for let's say I I see this record has already been clear if you were a lawful permanent resident have a child here or there US citizen right now if you are here legally ah those children are us citizens I mean even if you were here legally that is how the U.S has been treating those situations it's Nineteen sixties\nThe president looking at doing this or by executive order appears to be in a limited way too limited group of of individuals that are here illegally there's also this idea this birth tourism the idea of these people who are planning\nBirds around at companies that set this up the Obama administration really fought down a fought back against those companies as well because those people would get tourist visas\nThat have the children I think that's the issue as well or to talk about here so we're going to get it all the one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tended let's not forget we're a week out from the mid term elections we've got this caravan issue as well but people have a lot to say on this topic and I want to go right to the phones Greg in South Carolina\nOn line three Greg welcome to Jay sexual alive\nThank you for taking my call\nI'm I'm a resident in this country and um what I originally applied I applied for a temporary visa while the word processing like green card [noise]\nUm [noise] one of the things I had to do was appear in front of a judge and agree to deportation processes all habit actually in place that I've been deported should I write the laws of this country yeah my question is how could anybody even get to that position of training citizenship\nWhen the laws are already broken\nA you know it gets into an issue of it is the child needs to be bored breaking the law\nOr at what point did they make the decision now and so that's where it gets fuzzy Greg just to be honest with you legally that's why there will be battles over this discussion the heated discussions over it on both sides the out but I think what you brought up Greg what I hear too for so many people as those who came here legally\nThose who went through the process to be either become ultimately maybe ... play the ultimately become a U.S as it takes a long time we went through the ... the the temporary status to the permanent status ultimately to the citizenship status they are who are out there who are most affected\nBy these laws that that people could utilize this to jump for it I Will talk about we come back to the break but to me it's always interesting to hear from those calls you've had to go through the\nThe legal way right right it's very unfair to to the the hundreds of thousands if not millions of people waiting to get permanent residency or citizenship that they are pushed to the back because of the legal people coming in in jumping in and then that is that is on the face of it's not fair\nWe keep taking phone calls so we keep open up lines for there's two right now if you want to call in one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to the idea [noise] president will it'd birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants by executive order [noise]\nYou know some place to do that one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tend to talk to Saudi or an important to update to see a bb as well we get back from this break [noise]\n\nBut I Try to answer [noise]\nBears are asking traffic I pay toward you pour hundreds planned for than with ... and you can leave ... half\nHalf the money and then I ... down in North baton between foreign hungry in Brooklyn interchangeable going to be a really ... our\nI Would continue to avoid that really make anything from them on our I find more than half again against a team from ... wells on that in early but you know you type in your way from like ... pounds I find [noise]\nApplegate ...
