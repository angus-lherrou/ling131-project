I'm ... and uh the the client of a a sweat Nick missed what the client a Michael ... they come forward\nSo now you're saying that it's not just allegations of what's their sexual assault which will be serious and another ... obviously\nBut now it's also a judicial temperament credibility did he make Paul statements under oath about his activities in college this is where I so you're never going to get those that are opposed says nomination\nOn board with him what you're trying here to do what the Republicans are trying to do is can they hold three senators flake being one of them a center Collins and Murkowski that's what they that's where the focus is right now yeah absolutely\nIt's you're talking about a handful of senators if this is going to move forward that's who is important um because it's either I think it's very clear those those those handful vote over then I think you get ... maybe a couple of Democrats or the nomination goes down\nAnd the question also would be is while we're talking about this let's be honest or will there ever be a vote\n'em or will the nomination would be pulled that's also a political calculation right now it appears I'll go to say a bit of Washington that it appears that we're heading towards the vote even if it's even if it's like the healthcare ... compared to like that situation than like the health care vote\nWhere um we didn't know until the late Senator John McCain voted where it was going I mean but they decided to have the vote and and uh and things change I Would imagine though unlike that than\nThis is somewhat different I Can't imagine a college or Murkowski not putting out their statement before they voted 'cause this is so serious where do you think that I I think\nI think that's a great comparison joined I think there are a bunch of senators and the Democrat side of the aisle probably senator Manchin center Heitkamp senator Donnelly who don't want to take this vote so you know you have to ask the question of area and whether or not it's called I agree with you and senator Collins and Murkowski Senator Flake as well by the way because remember before consideration\nIn committee he did put out a statement so I think they will make a statement one way or another but I come back to this bottom line there's more information coming out the president's supported more information coming out at the end of the day that constitution gives the Senate\nThe duty to just vote yesterday a yes or no on a nominee I think they need to take that but you're going to have that information they should\nTake the vote well here's what but here's when I go back to I think this is you've seen this in three phases here Harry this is what I'm looking at you got three face in our first one was judicial\nPhilosophy they couldn't really\nThey they disagreed with it those left of center but they knew that that was under this qualifier right right so they that that didn't work then you had delayed allegations regarding the sexual assault serious they have a hearing on that reopen the hearing that space to of this I Would say and that goes and it made and it's kind of a drawl last week I mean it was\nThere were allegations there is no credible cooperating evidence of that time but Senator Flake then says I Want the FBI to investigate the the\nFBI investigation and is the president now says should be a comprehensive\nNow I'm starting to see it's not so much not that it's not about the allegations on sexual assault\nBut now it's about veracity under oath of what he did in college or didn't do in college and how we perceived as issues so now you're moving into what I call these three of this and the problem is time in Washington is never you know the longer it goes the better it gets is not usually how Washington works absolutely knew lived up soon northern Virginia for a long time you know that\nAbsolutely so if you look at the latest round of attacks on judge candidate a judge Kavanaugh\nEssentially they're grounded in his performance ah last week in defending himself and defending his family\nAnd so now some Democrats including professor Larry tribe are arguing\nThat judge Kavanaugh has this qualifies himself even if he were to be confirmed yeah why because he attempted to defend his family against arguably scoreless attacked\nAnd so uh uh uh Larry tribe argues judge ... justice Kavanaugh if he's confirmed could not operate as a justice of\nThe United the clinical fate that's a phase for attack yes it'll pay more for attack is if he gets in what can they do to cabin him whether it's\n... of course the recusing is completely after the justice there's no standard or the judge justice of the Supreme Court they decided they should recuse or not not some panel not some judicial calm personal ethics charges but they're trying to Cabot this so they've got this\nIt's a multi prong attack now with a strategy of what you gotta give 'em credit they're they're they're not that they're not smart enough to go ahead any no I mean they're doing a great job of doing what they set out to do and that's to resist because for Kavanaugh's nomination delay means defeat\nYeah yeah I Would just remind people that Elena Kagan came straight out of the Obama administration on to the Supreme Court\nAnd and did not recuse herself from the health care case say and so\nUh that you know and it was handled by her office civilian or for up to her it's up to her so they can they can complain all they want a but guess what if it's the highest court in the land ... you've lost your place\nUm art that's it I mean there's nowhere else to go now I I Do think that I don't like to use the word I think that would be\nLevel five impeach if but they would have to have again they'd have to super majorities they're not there yet but I think that the question is like for most Supreme Court justice even controversial\nLet's say justice Kavanaugh is confirmed\n... confirmed they try to look this up for a little bit longer in two years from now like is this going to be what people were electing a president over when we have another presidential election\nAre ... most people can't name a district court a Supreme Court justice not alone pick them out of a group of pictures now they might be able to pick by Kevin uh for a few years yeah but ask them for three years from now if they can question no probably not\nSo let me say give us the ... on a best case scenario what's the timeframe their ... and the realistic timeframe result I should say what is it realistic ... well the the sentence\nDebating unrelated bill right now Jay and they cannot get off of that bill until tomorrow night so the earliest the leader McConnell could file cloture would be tomorrow night which would mean it would set a cloture vote for friday more down that we\nKnew that we are report by tonight\nWell by tomorrow night or Mara nights when they get down to the un other bill right so then you have to have the intervening day according to rule twenty two you get the cloture vote on friday morning and then you have to add that that thirty hours a debate that we all know about food set up a final confirmation vote Jay for\nAs early as Saturday Night so friday morning for cloture Saturday Night for final confirmation that's really the fastest time line you could have here\nIs a Saturday Night the earliest now in there and then Blumenthal has already saying delayed the life and let's go ahead and take a phone call one eight hundred sixty four\nThirty one tell us gets oh yeah right to the phones we go a Christ is calling from California on line three crystal welcome to chase you alive I gross to\nTake I Love it but I Love every all that and ... thanks to quit\nThat's my plan is since the president already at a time limit for this investigation can they demand\nGo longer and my second question is does judge Kaplan I had any recourse against or whether or not he get that the point that that\nWell on the on the question on timeframe so the FBI's got at the president said he wants to return in a week they are capable of doing that Andy Beyer resources are going to be able to do something that's not a criminal investigation oh they're not interview and and but not trying to recreate the crime scene there trying to find you know the truth here as to what allegations are there's no doubt that the FBI\nHas the capability that I mean the the the person power is there they could get the agents out to do these leads and follow them up in a day I mean I've done I've I've handled the FBI investigations in terms of supervising FBI agents and told him I Want you to go out and interview this witness and they come back with a thrill to the next day\nSo it would look for more than right down there in in in ... so that's number one number two records for judge Kavanaugh if confirmed no I mean he just goes on the bench and and rules and then that's it it beats not confirmed he goes back to the court of appeals although they do you put it behind them trying to trying to get him removed they'd have to have a super majority that I\nThought I was saying I I don't see it doubled down on issues that people move past that again it it's like it's like we have some calls you still say let's open up the investigation they get here we hear that right and the truth is that not happening too many people are not that focus they want a government is moving forward and doing things proactively to help them\nRight to help the American economy to help the American military to help the American people\nThis is a an ad so this back looking ... sounds okay in the middle of it but then it's very tough if you have any protests mood to receive that just don't they don't pan out because it's it's a if you fail it failed failed so yeah I mean we're talking about a situation where\nYou said you think the boats going to happen is he going to be confirmed\nI think the vote will happen I think there's a greater chance than not that he will be confirmed Jay but look just underscore the point you just made I think if it goes past this week you have crystal clear evidence\nThat what is being pursued here is not the truth I mean because you were just a matter of days ago that Chris Coons and Jeff Flake made this deal that said look we're ready to make our decision if you get the FBI one week\nTo look at these allegations then we'll have the information that we need to make a vote or J. if that goal post is changed again\nI Will tell you a certain due to the United States Senate does the detractors of Brett Kavanaugh are not looking for truth or evidence on which to base their decisions and they just never want to take the vote so I Do think that vote is going to happen and I will tell you that if it doesn't happen I think there is a commitment inside the United States Senate to just ...\nLane until the nominee is withdrawn and frankly I think that's in front of the constitution you think that as an ... do you think that's a possibility here\nYes it's a possibility but I did the scheduling to the voters up to one person and that's leader McConnell and I think he knew we had that he's editor of time it will be done because we don't have culture we don't you will know the answer to that tomorrow night Jay when the FAA builds finished if leader McConnell files cloture tomorrow night I think\nYou can really close to ... be I investigation a complete without the three oh Tucson beard\nHe could but I don't think he will but basically you need three days after filing closure before you here's a bomb them you could go right into next week\nYeah I mean the only way to look at it this I mean everything has to line up perfectly for this to go to be done this weight\n... you're absolutely correct I mean that's really where we are ... meantime of course the Democrats are coming up with more and more fresh allegations which may not necessarily be grounded in any fact [noise]\nAll right we're taking a break up you don't get to pull out of the program go over to ACL Jay dot org or any of our multiple

justice secular\nSo let me give you a sense of where it is a as we were in the second half hour to broadcast I I'm looking this thing now in phases and I this is uh something I worked on Leslie in this morning but I think this is where it is based one of his a confirmation was judicial philosophy and he passed it reluctantly by the Democrats they're not going to vote for maybe a few on the floor will\nBut he you could argue with the judicial philosophy is judicial capability his qualifications to be a judge that did not work then you get the last minute eleventh hour base to\nAttacks on allegations of sexual of salt it starts with Dr Ford it ends up to others so you have faced too and that expands out at base to is all these other um allegations against him so there are serious allegations they've got to be investigated president authorizes an FBI check after three Republican said no\nI'm we're not going to vote on him until you have a full episode vi investigation he authorizes they were his words president's word comprehensive a investigation for background this background check not a criminal case\nThat space to then you're starting to see now I think we're in a phase three based or he's a little bit different they're not so much going to find it looks like cooperating evidence on the sexual assault or at least so far they have it so what are they go to where their statements that judge Kavanaugh made under oath that maybe were false misconstrued basically a a what we would call it a thousand one violation if it was a federal case\nA a false statement to me that's where it is their space story then there's a face for we're not at\nBase for yet but we're clearly and phase three and delay his defeat I think that is what the economists said earlier and that fits right in with the scenario that I'm putting together and that's exactly where I think there's cases right now if I was looking at this was a lawyer in charge of is I Would say you're in the story\nAnd the way you respond to phrase pastry is get this FBI investigation over with rapidly put thoroughly they can do what they the capabilities and vote yes or no if it's no it's no the jets the jets get the process over with now they sell it may be he's up there right now dealing with the staff\nThat it's not like it there is a chance it's this by friday but that's not a guaranteed by any stretch of anyone's imagination\nYeah I think the sense that I'm getting Jay is the Senate Republicans believe that Senate Democrats have as many phases if we want to call them that as they will allow them to have so I think leader McConnell has decided this is the last one senator tuned in Senator Flake made\nA deal for the FBI investigation and when that runs its course there will be a vote I Do think that's accurate Jay but look if Senate Republicans decide not to to force it through and I think Senate Democrats will bring as many of these stages or as they allow\nIt then you get into face for I think they form becomes very difficult phase for becomes not only it's it's it's a ... that's what happens in pays for here it becomes a pile on an ... you know face so if the Republicans are trying to get the nominee confirmed and if they're willing to wait for the FBI investigates which is supposed to be done expeditiously get it done in both because we go to face for I don't see\nHow this goes forward I think that's correct so it's important to know too much violence there is really only an audience of about five individual federal I mean that's really important free moderate Republicans to moderate Democrats\nAnd I think all five are wavering at this particular point and so if we go to space for a that may be enough uh two caused the collapse what do you ...\nI mean the FBI airport will will come out this was the deadline is friday the votes so that would trigger the time to thirty hours and all this a procedure that most go on\nA that will be very telling itself it should be enough for us to know if the votes are going to be there or not I mean that that's it I mean they're they're either going to be there or not based off this um I don't believe there should be any more uh\nFBI investigations passed this of I don't think that there should be any more testimony [noise] uh there should not be more they just need a particular hearings or anything like that it is they gave it over to the FBI Congress\nAs usual punted\nTo another branch we got back to another branch you get back to the executive we it was interesting because their role is if I can say they they think is so important but then they give it back to the executive to really make a decision for them and and that is what I think that's what's being done what if the FBI presents nothing\nThose those fighters have to vote yes on Capitol something they have\nA choice if I were to find out soon enough now those who is who is anyone you expected\nI suspect those two two and then by the close of
