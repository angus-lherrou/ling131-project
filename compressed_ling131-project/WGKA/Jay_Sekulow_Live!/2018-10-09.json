Washington\nAnd justice Douglas or for thirty six years on the Supreme Court he wrote some of the most important legal decisions some of which are kind of nutty but they're very important and justice Douglas had so many ethical problems and just named one of them\nHe actually because he had so many alimony payments he had three ex wives\nAnd he had to write little articles to help meet the expenses because he wasn't generating enough money and he wrote articles for a guy who happen to be a pornographer who had a case before the courts and he later than pay the money back but he was caught with that\nAnd and they see also wrote articles that it had appeared in like a magazines were some justices thought were pornography he didn't and just that\nPlus the fact that he got involved with a Twenty one year old who had been assigned to do a term paper and her college about justice Douglas he was married at the time he got involved with her it could be construed as sexual harassment and today's terms it didn't\nHis judgeship a and a and by the way there were attempts to impeach him and they were foolish and I oppose those attempts\nOr they were led by Gerald Ford who later became president of the United states as a point over here is that when people say oh because he said I'm some in temperate things when he was giving testimony he can never be taken seriously as a judge Clarence Thomas has had a fine career on the court\nHe's made some by the way brilliant and amazing speeches since being confirmed on the court\nAnd uh I don't think he has been ruined by the charges against him or let them ruined him at all David I appreciate your call very much um we have a time to go to the audio Jeremy for from Cairo\nOkay we are coming up well we're coming up to um somebody who is ...\nAnd criticism the rock well maybe not so beyond criticism and this particular movie member rock was one of the world's tallest buildings and rescue people flying through the air\nWell the movie's called skyscraper worth checking out on DVD and video on demand will tell you in the ...

Bennett who is are are designated representative to the United nations for the European Central injustice our European affiliate are bought a international community pressure is the reason to see a bb is alive\nWe have found at time and time again with these cases professor Hutchinson that keeping international pressure up is what keeps these people alive\nAbsolute but he's so international community pressure is absolutely necessary absolutely essential to maintain the life of a ... baby\nA it's clear beyond question that there are many people within the Pakistani community who are prepared to allow these blasphemy charges to go forward with out evidence as a way of course in the minority Christian population within their country\nAnd I think it's absolutely essential for westerners poor people from all over the world to mobilize against this effort if we are going to sustain a C a baby's life and sustain the lives of Christians where ever they are throughout the world\nSkip let me ask you this is our international law expert here and the ... runs or international legal group give me your sense of the nature in scope and the importance of his day obviously we're fighting for this woman's life see there's nothing more important but this blasphemy issue is a really serious problem on a global scale\nIt really is for instance even in Pakistan we have determined that when you can get a fair trial and Pakistan provide that the issue is not one of these very\nSensitive issues like last Sunday so this is a problem with recall the twenty eleven the former governor of one of the states came out in support of your baby and he was assassinated because he just took the stand saying that she wasn't getting a fair trial so the pressure on the judges is amazing\nNow what they are what the international Islamic community though is concerned about is that this type of thing and bring discredit upon his law and I and I think they're as concerned about that as anything else and therefore the outside world needs to race and keep the pressure on so that we say this is not what you claim Islam to be\nBut look was we'd look and see what happens in Pakistan we see this law being misused of being applied primarily either as to to get a vendetta against somebody or to keep down the minority populations so we have to keep pressure on them so that her name is constantly\nUh before the government of Pakistan and pour the course of Pakistan so they will operate in the correct way\nAs I said we're taking comments coming in from Facebook and periscope as well as your number of calls that went in hundreds of say for thirty one done maybe in on Facebook wrote this can the u._s. put pressure on Pakistan to withholding international aid than\nA yes the answer is yes and we've asked for that on this case in a number of others Pakistan actually gay as one of the largest recipients of us\nAre foreign aid I'm a human rights have have long been something to the United States Congress has done a poor job of of of drawing money down on for Jay we have consistently said if you want to be an ally the United states human rights especially agree just violations like this one\nShould be one of the criteria to continue seeing those dollars Jay we will make that request again next year we think that this should be something that should cost Pakistan a usa\nSherry I I'm getting a lot of people I'm looking at some of the Facebooking periscope feed this coming up before me a lot of people saying they're going to pray for the judges\nLet's skip mentioned that the governor that came out in favor of a C a baby was assassinated what's the pressure like on these judges\nWill just by looking at today's hearing there were a lot of Muslim clerics present in the court I just received an email from a from her office there in which they have told me that a Pakistani Muslim group has released a video in which they have noticed this uh this hearing and they are saying that\nThey have these judges are are open to releasing her and I'm listening to even listening to the appeal was horrendous for them and they have released that video asking for death penalty for her\nAnd even against the judges or that they are very angry at the judges to even hear the appeal\nI don't know if we have the hash tag ... we do I want to show people what's going on on on the social media platforms right now or by Muslim radicals that are trying to make this case um they want to see the definitely look take a look on on the screen I mean this is this tells you what's going on\nAnd uh let me hang around here is what that's called\nI mean there you have a nice sort of showed up on my feet over the weekend as we were starting to promote the case\nUh we've been involved in this case for many many years and I it it's there's always been some of this but I think it's fair to say well it's never been at this this is the highest level of\nSocial media interaction coming out of it looks like Pakistan or certainly um they're they're using Arabic uh and sometimes in English sometimes appropriately the English sometimes not but clearly they're trying to make a point here so what what's your what's your Harry are saying\nUh skip is it the judges are under incredible amount of stress absolutely and they looked like they want to do the right\nThing I think they\nWith a reasoned opinion and they can then throw it back if they wish to to say the a false accusing the blasphemy is in itself a form of blasphemy and then that could put people to be more careful in the future about making ... ... per se accusation\nThe gym on periscope asked this question have you had a question of parents could replace we'll get an or social media teams looking at right now can the un do anything I feel like they're joke when it comes to these types of cases actually they can be quite helpful in these types of cases\nI've got issues with the United nations but they they can be a very important force than a to utilize international as you said international literature can be very important [noise]\nI think there's a reason to be frustrated and frankly those frustrations were the reason that the United states officially left the human rights council we've talked about this many times Jake you put the wrong members in the human rights council their effectiveness two official\nYou stand in the way of actions like this is very much uh to the detriment so I thought the United states leaving was the right call there\nBut we as the ISI L. J. engaging\nOr through formal intervention sometimes they're written sometimes they're oral Jay it as one of the blessed platforms that we have uncovered for keeping a case like this in in the in the visibility of the international community and look I I'm I'm going to say if there wasn't any visibility on this case unconvinced you to see a needy would not be alive no debt\nYahoo does say she'd be dead I mean ... professor ... would be without an international attention that\nSends would have been executed absolutely so if you look at this from the context of the domestic political atmosphere in Pakistan\nThis would be an easy case for the justice in other words they could throughout the presumption of innocence fake it for a while the rule of law because they're under intense pressure from her clerics and activists\nOr to execute someone for a crying she did not commit\nSo it's absolutely essential to maintain international political pressure uh so that the outcome of this case can\nBe reversed in her paper All right we've got thirty more minutes of this broadcast so if you want to stay with us we appreciate that on Facebook and prayers go you know how to do it religiously or radio just go over to a C. O. J. dot org or Facebook or periscope broadcasting it there wouldn't be wracked with more than just a minute but again [noise]\nPray for these ... of course our family pray for these judges that are going to make that decision could come out of any literally\nAt any moment and it's that important that we hear from you on this really critical that we hear from you on this uh and that you're praying for a sea of baby and praying for these judges will make the decision as we get more information of course we will get a two year will be back with more in just a moment\n\n\nOr you are responsible person to find yourself going deeper and credit card debt than get money for a toll free number that will put you on a path and financial recovery community debt management\nWill consolidate your accounts and work with your creditors you'll save thousands and become debt free for keeps if you're a debt has you know we should talk called trinity at one eight hundred nine nine oh six nine seven six one eight hundred\nNine nine oh six nine seven six one eight hundred nine nine oh sixty nine Seventy six\n[noise]\nBroadcast that when we're talking about the case of a sea of baby a special three member bench\nOf the Supreme Court on Monday reserved it's judgment on the final appeal against the execution of a sea of baby but the hearing went very well uh normally Ninety percent of cases as we've said that they get a decision right away this one they're holding we think that for security purposes\nJordan has been following this case where it's a lot of our international work especially the persecution issues he'd been heavily involved in this area to say when I asked him about it\nFor to have a special report on a C a bb this is the case involving the Christian Woman who's been sentenced to death\nIn Pakistan or for sharing her faith they accused or a blasphemy case she's been in jail for eight years she's a mother we have been heavily involved in our case we are case we have an office in Pakistan it's been involved directly in the case\nAnd um I Will tell you how heated it's become when we sent out a request for people to pray about a pray for her family and the lawyers are handling the case I I did this over the weekend because of the hearing was today um that we started this we saw all of a sudden\nI'm moving to a technical term I guess it just is what they're just the people that were writing really horrible things about a sea of maybe we were saying pray for people or say hang on for actually hang a sea it'd be but\nYeah I mean there's multiple in English is hashtags running through this it was just going to Pakistan as well but um it's a again to anything positive about a sea of baby so I wouldn't be enough you\nTweak things out and ... with your Twitter account but it's happening worldwide not just to our Twitter out I'm at this call for what section of surreal all to do it under a as we said this is the death penalty case\nAnd are these are ... primarily a a Muslim Pakistanis who are are calling for her to be executed ... so its hang her executed or kill her punish her\nAnd uh and again this makes it so a dangerous for the judiciary there because they've judges have died in the past it at the top court as well as other cabinet members who have expressed support for ... years now but in prison or eight years how difficult\n... will will will do this in the moment but we'll get back to the top of a bond there see it'd be be cases for a moment here this was this is the hearing this was the hearing ...\nYes are we talking 'cause we talked to sharia are you know from our office right he said this is it I mean this is\nYeah so that they X comes a verdict and there's no timeline on that most cases in Pakistan even the Supreme Court so very I'm like ours at the highest court in their language the three judge panel\nOr the chief justice did sit on this one we know that um that's a pretty ... Ninety per sitcom\nThat day you know I could write it it'll be right ... yeah um this important cases so the other ten percent they do take time but I don't it's not usually the time like here where it could be months and months and months from our Supreme Court this this could happen at any moment there's probably a lot of security concerns at risk here\nThere's geopolitical issues at risk here um and I get nervous because of what these judges face so I'm a what we saw before his is even like you get to this point\nAnd judges start leaving so you don't have a core um so you can have a verdict\nYou got to go through it again I get nervous about all of that because you know they're under sounded like hearing went very well the hearings have gone well for her is that the judges have either been killed or have quit\nAnd ah it again I think that's ... that's a ... we get people more and more update on his the news comes in you know we're gonna we're gonna give you a full ... hour on that tomorrow is that big of a case I Would prefer the judge is\nIn a situation I mean that's the only ... and even the prosecutors\nAh the government officials at the police um her attorneys as well of course her family but I Know you're doing that but but especially for those judges not not on the decision a but but on a their safety um even while they're um they're deciding a because what we know the other side is that is try to harass or kill them\nBefore they got into a decision points\nSo the ... I think that is the fundamental question here and that is the concern over the judges\nAnd the impact of all of that are we're taking a break um\nWe come back from the break we're going to take some more comments got some calls are coming in order to save for thirty one baseball can parents go get your comments in as well [noise]\nCase has been argued [noise]\nWe wait we're hoping we're waiting because they're going to set the right security apparatus in place\nThat case later the week [noise]\nAndrew Brunson trial starts again October twelfth I mean there is a lot going on on the international scene that's why we want to take a break on this uh today to to focus on some of these other cases will be back with\nPutting your comments get those enforce again to put them in the comments or social media team is reviewing a those as you you've got to pray for those judges as they make a decision to get rid of his death sentence for a sea of beer crime give me a couple of water to Muslim women and ends up becoming a blasphemy charge more in a moment\nI taught a dancer traffic\nHere's your act in traffic half gate Q eighty five on both sides had handed calving Fulton County really straddling\nHe ... off the meaning if you are having found found on the west side you're looking at almost be forty minute drive came\nOnto any time to get from that cop cleverly pounds when he ... he signed it even worse traffic crawling near the Lawrence do highway it's gonna take almost fifty minutes telling south found\nOn the brand that are from like anytime soon he I plenty without getting new crashing Fulton County and in fact ... by housing ... ...\nAnd the traffic in the ...
