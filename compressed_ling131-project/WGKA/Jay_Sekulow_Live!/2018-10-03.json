Collins\nAnd center mccaskey it gets two of those three votes he's going to be a justice if he doesn't Jay you won't make\nOr we're going to go to the phones we want and what you have to say we do want your comments on this one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tenth of you're listening to us by radio give us a call it a hundred sixty four thirty one ten if you're following us on Facebook or Twitter or TV get your comments and also that way in the comments sections on on Facebook\nOr on periscope is where our social media teams looking at those we do want to hear from you let's go ahead and take your questions coming in from Alan in in New York on line three Helen welcome to Jay secular lifestyle\nI guess\nThat what's happening now if you have to live in the sixties and I've never seen this before and I was wondering is there a way to override this foolish is the Democratic party judge Kavanaugh is not I\nKnow you've got to I mean the liberal look here's what the constitution says the president nominates\nWith the advice and consent of the Senate so you have both branches or two of the branches of government involved selecting will be the third branch of government that history so article one article to an article three all in play here but no if he did it mean procedurally than let's let's quickly review that procedurally what happens next\nSooner report the FBI reports are done today what do they do them tonight\nThe first thing they will do is what's called file closer day it's just simply emotion from leader McConnell to start the end of the debate now there will be no voted that phase there has to be a day in between according to rule twenty two so two days after closures filed which would be friday if this filed today\nThey would take a cloture vote which requires fifty votes in the United States Senate after that Jay there will be thirty hours of what's called post cloture debate and then there will be a final vote so ultimately he's got to clear those two votes likely on friday and Saturday both at a fifty vote threshold\nAnd Jay goes back to Jordan's point about Merrick Garland I mean the constitution says the Senate can vote\nNot vote they can do yes they can vote no uh but ultimately it's there is to decide so votes on friday and Saturday\nWhat do you thing happened to ... I think uh I get this all comes down to how if the Republicans are hold together or not I mean the I don't I don't think it comes down to any Democrats\nI'm On the actual votes so's do Republicans hold together um I I Do believe they will put out statements\nUm clarifying not just say was here and there but actual statements about how they vote 'em as it gets closer to that made me that they allow a vote on cloture but they they don't vote they don't vote for the nominee I Am talking about Republicans here so it could be a twenty four hour period where\nUm you could get passed cloture because there's there's some who believe that that's you should not a truck\nAnd allow a vote and still don't know because that's the that's passed the obstruction part but they\nGet I think you're talking to three or four people right now probably just three you know what I mean I think it's a Jeff Flake Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins a lesser something the airport that causes the nomination has to be withdrawn\nWhat would that be any if there was an allegation in the report how would that ... is what is this report look like\nReport simply is a statement of the facts that the FBI\nIs elicited from witnesses that they've uh interviewed and it just said oh conclusions of now I said I talked to John Smith John Smith says I talk to Jane Doe she says she says she says is she denies this she admits does whatever and it's a two three page document depending on how long remembered two agents there's always two agents\nWho are going to be interviewing these a particular person and then they're going to just factually ... if it's done right if it's done right and if it's the FBI\nI Know and I remember that's the way they're going to do it and they're going to turn it over and you draw your own conclusions from the facts\nSo if that's the case yeah and there is no cooperating evidence of the sexual assault outlines the question then is it most of the face three which they're already at the judicial temperament\nIssue that's the temperament issue that everybody's talking about that he was too angry that he was too hard that is that he was too partisan he was attacked\nAbout a horrible things and then how was he supposed to react so what's your reaction to that\nWell I think Andy is correct I think the Republicans they have to steal themselves to the fact that they will face a\nBuyer store they faced a firestorm initially with respect to judge Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy they faced a firestorm with respect to be alleged sexual misconduct\nNow they have to deal with allegations that judge Kavanaugh violated some ethical rules that he's through ice that he lacks judicial temperament and so the quintessential question becomes what will the Republicans stand up will they fight back\nOr will they indeed have caused the the attacks\nAre going to be unrelenting which is all part of a premeditated intentional strategy on the part of the Democrats and the Republicans have to face the fact that those charges those allegations\nWill indeed continue this oh will they stand up or will they not time will tell\nBut I think there is a face for TBIs than and that face for is let's assume you get through the ... the traditional temperament face it's going to be they're just trying to run the clock out where the guy out\nI Do want to make that clear the Democrats said they don't like his personality they don't like how he handled uh the hearing uh they were never going to vote for him they were all no votes every single one that he spoke to in that area of the Judiciary Committee was a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh was already and announce no vote before he opens his mouth before he had to come back a\nAfter his judicial philosophy hearings and into this personality here about his personal life here is they were they were nose before all that right some didn't even me with a a Democrats or he met with a sixty some odd senators because the mini refused set big said that being said\nIt is Republicans who will be responsible for his failure\nTo I'm not saying it's every Republican personally I'm saying it is Republican senators who have the majority\nIt it would be Jeff Flake and what are the Lakers and say what is he doing playing gays because he's retired so he's trying to make a name for himself before he goes I mean if you went alone now they know me either weekly\nLet's face it he goes Chris Coons gets in there for hours works on them and the Judiciary Committee he comes out of the ... sits back and he says although died and get advanced it but there's got to be an investigation investigating now there's an investigation\nAlways as if we had to do we have that is their sound from Jeff Flake saying the partisan issue you know I Want to play that if we have let's go ahead and play it\nI was I was very troubled by the the tone of the uh the remarks the interaction with the members was sharp and partisan and that concerns me that and I tell myself you give a little leeway because of what he's done through\nPeople are out alleging that he was guilty of rape right I mean people forget what they were asking Brett Kavanaugh than I mean and I mean he attempted rape\nNo they were always is planning to move on and you know Jay and during that hearing I I was\n... when you listen to what judge this huge like yeah when you listen to what Senator Flake said I mean he defended himself go ahead [noise]\nWell I just say I was critical of Cory Booker and Kamala Harris for running for president during the hearing I look I think that's where Jeff lakes do and you just went to New Hampshire so you know we can criticize with political motives on both sides and I think all three of them day I think that's what they were doing type here's what we're doing we're here for another thirty minutes we're taking your calls one eight hundred sixty four thirty one day and\nSo again Russ as we come back we'll one line open and they were little lines are going to open up the way to get will do some calls even in the first\nSegment coming back in the second half hour and hundred sixty four thirty

from\nWashington DC the secular old\nI Know she felt so for the American Center for law and justice secular\nSo here we are in face I mean clearly face three of the judicial confirmation process we're going to go right to our bones and I'm older but let me just laid out very quickly for those just joining us phase one judicial philosophy that was the first hearings professor options and said this among don't say it again in a short way a concise way he he passed the judicial philosophy dead even knew what he does a great\nWith this law somebody absolutely I mean it was clear beyond question that's why the Democrats are so prepared to move around quickly to face to face three\nYeah so base to was the sexual assault allegations and they were taken seriously and there was an FBI investigation or ... and ... and it was I ordered it now looks like it's being completed it may be even be done today let's quickly tell everybody what that's going to look like right now there is no leaks of any cooperating evident\nNo there isn't and that means it probably isn't any but we'll wait and we'll see what a what leaks there are the three oh Tuesday it tells what happened\nBut that that investigation simply was further background investigation into the allegations made by these three women and perhaps others and it's a factual investigation made by the agents who are in the field to agents interview each person and come back with a factual statement of what they find that you\nFace three which is where we are right now is the attack on judicial temperament Jordan that's where we are right now\nYeah and his personality I mean like his personality at the hearing um after he's been accused of right now of course they wouldn't have even Russian on judicial far right this is his personality after he gets accused of attempted rape and are these allegations no cooperation and these Republican senators are agreed to allow\nA doctor for to come testify even though no one will will agree that uh even acknowledge it her stories any bit of truth like even a bit of truth\nTo it or who was actually a president at the time or even someone who was a not even president but uh but around her at that time period um and yet they allowed this to happen\nHe he likes to have it um as usual these senators show they're very good at giving speeches they they're not prepared most are not prepared for responses they don't like being a they don't like toughness or they love to act tough and act right and they are nasty people they are nasty if I'm President Trump says that\nAh it it has a it's a real tone because it means something different to be\nA a mean are kind of obnoxious and nasty and I think a good ... to ... to put that up for like ... or ...\nYeah they both have this tone that doesn't sound so obnoxious but they are meet at the end of their nasty yeah every question is uh is is is so ... about the person uh recently tournament I think he kind of meats all those states he's more of a tough guy there um but\nHow tough where they where they get someone to go back at them they get these these are blue state senators they don't ever have real opposition to the alright\nSo thin where are we on the timeframe and then we're gonna we will get calls right after the break but where we on the timeframe exactly what the hell do we expect to happen I got word that there can be a boat Saturday I\nMean I I think I think that's correct yeah I mean I think they're waiting for the FBI to turn over their report those three oh two\nOne you didn't get that I've met happens today no cooperating evidence what happens\nI Believe leader McConnell will file cloture tonight which would set a vote cloture vote on friday probably late in the day and then a final vote on Saturday afternoon J I think that's the only thing they're waiting for\nI I don't think they know whether or not they have the votes but I think they are committed to study that clock in motion as soon as they had that a report from the FBI and that would be a cloture vote on friday and a final vote on Saturday\nSo it's a yeah you're on a on Saturday in your view\n[noise] that's right and I think it's important to point out we are joined it earlier that did that in most cases if you clear a cloture vote you're fine on final I think because of the dynamics here I don't think that's true I think both of those votes or a hurdle what do you think any\nYeah I think are saying is right both of the boats are but I think it's going to clear cloture and if he loses it's gonna be ... Republicans that did it to him not the Democrats\nDon't I I think this is the substance here were Democrats will just be bonus votes if they come on board [noise] they're not going to be this way here it is Jeff like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski if there's a chance for brains having all that means he got passed this that the FBI Rick Perry [noise]\nNorms analysis spot on but I fear must be Republican and most of the Republicans what does that mean\nAnd it's something that time is it you know it's ... days killed days to go All right we'll take your calls we come back from the break one eight hundred sixty four thirty one thing if you're watching on Facebook and bears go we've got a special video for years we always do it the same so we'll have that ready for you in just a moment but again a C.
