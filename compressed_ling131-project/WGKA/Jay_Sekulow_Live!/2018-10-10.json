you're on the Michael Mann that show\nBut I disagree with your harshly here go ahead and I think and this is the this is the fact of the matter I think that it's about everybody's officers being or do you have religious people on the right to vote their precious religious freedom\nAnd all of those is very religious freedom to impose their values on the other\nWay way way way way north to tell me tell me how that applies\nTo the case we're talking about in other words the case of a Baker\nWho says look all all you can buy any geeky one for me I don't want to do a special wedding cakes for gay wedding ... why why is that not taking away his rights to say no to a customer who wants him to do something he doesn't want to do\nOkay my First Amendment rights and for someone else's fourteenth

fine\nYes he would have lied it would not have been find\nSomething you want to stay out of trouble\nCorrect it would have been very convenient for him to live and he didn't want to use a personal

particular cake\nI see I don't understand why it is a gay marriage is the law the land and and and\nYou have to respect the law the land we all live here we all believe that it's the law the

them but if they said we're not hiring you because we don't have any openings now it's basically just a way of getting around a lot of that's fine\nOkay but here it is a question of someone not

this question is uh Nikki Haley's going to be leaving at the end of the year a surprise to the American people not a surprise to the president a but it's important to understand the role that Nikki Haley has played a advancing usa at first and supporting our allies especially Israel where she's going to\nA tremendous job and she's been tough on North Korea too I mean she's she was she was very tough a following administrations guidance and so I think she was a very effective advocate for getting the position of being a distraction to the world I think that you know whenever you say what is one of the hallmarks of Nikki Haley's tenure as you and the best I think that clearly on my number\nOne a hallmark is when she announced that the U.S would no longer be giving out aid to countries who voted against us interest that the UN that we would no longer be supporting countries who were taking opposition's or a positions to the U.S and that we're all related to the recognition\nOf Jerusalem as Israel's capital by the U.S and the move our embassy and she said\nThe times have changed that the U.S is no longer going to be your piggy bank where you can come to the UN or denounced the U.S\nVote against our interest and then assume that we're going to give you a millions upon millions of dollars so I see that change\nUh American leadership it's a total shift\nFrom out of the state department in from the diplomacy in the U.S\nHas has existed for decades it was we used to have the idea of kind of placate everybody with cash now it now the new strategy is we take that cash from you and you can come begging to us when you changed your policy I think that's exactly right they never won I think that there is that relates to all of those issues\nAre so we're taking your calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one town we want to know your thoughts on what do you think the main issue that we should be focusing on view in the United states and I my I start with Israel but I Want to get other people's and North Korea certainly in there as well Iran another one I mean you're talking about hot spots so you went to Vassar ship than you are un representative\nFor the ... it's a big role I mean and look through years is a longtime service uh in that role she's worked very very hard I we had the chance to work with her a closely last year and I've been an obscene or a on and off during the last a year and a half and I will not see there you could tell she is working on it and I think she did a great uh disappointed that their job\nIt's a huge role Jay because of how\nMany leverage point to exist inside that chamber in Jordan talked about the financial aid when I totally agree with that I also think ah in in terms of foreign policy team everything comes back to that signature move of moving the embassy\nBut think about the other leverage points Jamie no longer has the United states deferred to other caucuses inside the un I mean the organization for the Islamic cooperation do you think they're driving the agenda now know the United states is\nNo longer have they decline to use their leverage to things like vetoes and the Security Council which the last administration\nDeclined to do a no longer had they been afraid to withdraw from ineffective un bodies think about unrest and then again back to the financial support both dollars to the United nations and two countries who don't align with the United states to Jay\nAll of those levers points that essentially the last administration had laid down a President Trump an investor Haley pick them back up and use them over the last two years yeah I think that's a no you're exactly\nCorrect and you know I think very effectively as I said well taking your calls and comments eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten let's go ahead and take a vocal yet right to the phones we go Jerry in Rhode Island on line three Jerry welcome to the United states have welcomed three of the about the other hand welcome do their job\nI think I think you partially answered the question like\nI I mentioned the producer when when you put an ambassador end I'm assuming that even the agenda by the point the president ... or like I said so what part of it as a reactionary for the rest of the world so when you ask us what are we saying whatever work just now with Harry\nBecause not broke don't fix it he's going that way but I think it comes from a leader and the president\nWas your so here's what happened to the United nations up sometimes is a cabinet level but not always under this administration it has been a cabinet level I think under Brock Obama's it was not\nUm so independent she was a cabinet members that meant you had to go through the confirmation ... investors do anyways but she had to go through a confirmation process but the agenda is set by the administration she works closely with the president the secretary of state where she was extremely effective is our advocacy at the United nations itself both publicly and behind the scenes\nYeah that's right I mean she again I think she showed this idea of strength\nShe changed the way the U.S foreign policy was going to move forward or from the past administration so the Trump Administration and she put it into action\nSo she called the un out for what it was she called the Russians out for what they were doing the Chinese what they were doing the Iranians stood with Israel and when the administration decided to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move our embassy to uh to is to Jerusalem\nThe there were there was voted to you and of all these countries condemning that\nAfter that even before she said you better what we're watching how you vote after that she announced the new U.S plan which is that you would no longer receive aid if you regularly voted against us interest at the United nations I think we get that if you're a country that came to the un\nAnd bashed the U.S and and then voted against her interest but you received all this a humanitarian aid for I Know more humanitarian aid for you if you continue to vote that way and act that way\nBut when you say than a from your experience in dealing with the state department on this issue I says she's a very effective advocate both publicly and behind the scenes what's your sense\nI think the most effective we've seen in recent times she and look at it comes back to the ambition level of the ... the ... the engine is not very ambitious to position is not that important but this agenda was incredibly ambitious all the way from the embassy move to the financial aid withdrawing from bodies\nAnd back to the last caller's point I think it really enters this question Jay the president determines the agenda but then the ambassador has to implement I'll just give you one example withdrawing from the human rights council that is a decision that has made at the presidential let a level but then ambassador Haley had to actually go down to the human rights council and implemented in and\nI'll tell you the fallout was tremendous around the world and I would say in an extremely important in a positive way because that council has has has ceased to further a human rights agenda for a long time now but the president decides investor Haley has to actually go into the well into the chamber and implement that agenda let me play for you what\nA Nikki Haley said this is a former announcement yesterday\nPaul what has happened in the United states on foreign policy now the United states we have what\nWe say we're going to have something we fall for that whether it was that the chemical weapons in Syria whether that other country wants to pay their fair weather trade deals with the naval base have fallen\nSo I think the legacy that Nikki Haley creates is a very positive one but look it's an important role I Know there's a lot of people complain about the UN and believe me we are critical because they they their policies on Israel and others have been ridiculous and they're fake redlines in and you can go on and on the back of the matter is that we need a victim advocates there\nAnd we've had that with the gay guy late so again we want to know kind of your view on what you think the top aspect topics you should be that we're addressing at the un I view it as this way in the middle east\nAnd this isn't at any particular order I I think these are the big issue points it's the middle east so it's the it's the it's the Israel Palestinian conflict the greater Middle East that would include Iran because you have to look at the Iranian situation that's part of that then you got the whole Russia\nThe issues would you grade then you go over to China you've got the issues with China and then particularly been into the Korean Peninsula as you look at that agenda you understand that that UN ambassador has got a broad swath of what they're dealing with yeah when you deal with an expert in a lot of\nIt was Russia and you deal with Iran you're also dealing with Syria and that conflict there um and then of course the broader issue which is reforming a corrupt\nUnited Nations so we looked at the edge defunding of unrest and those other kind of a un programs that have been a a so so poorly run and uh again so this out of control you and I think all of that is very important I'd love to hear from everybody out there one eight hundred\nSix eight four thirty one to ... hundred six eight for three one\nZero it and then you said that you thought that um the fact that that the situation in North Korea and the sanctions there and Nikki Haley's aggressiveness on behalf of the president in ... in the United states served as very well\nYeah and you mentioned it earlier in the broadcast day but I think it belongs in that list that you in Jordan just rattled through because North Korea has no doubt move in a positive direction now we're not all the way where we need to be but the reason that that dialogue is happening in the reason that progress has been made\nIs because the United states led the international community and putting sanctions in place on North Korea to actually bring them back to the table investor Haley was the main spokesman in the United nations chamber of for those sanctions so I think you know going forward certainly in the middle east is always the epicenter ... always has to hostility towards Israel\nFront and center on their agenda but I think right or in the next year is that North Korea a front\nI think that's right and so what's going to happen is the president's going to make a an announcement in the days ahead\nOf who is nominee will be ... and we'll talk about that process there'll be a confirmation process there\nTalk tough when necessary stand up to bullies at at the un but also a or B a reconcile and uh be diplomatic at the same time and I think that's something that Nikki Haley had a unique ability and why she has been so popular in that role of standing tough\nWithout it's seeming gratuitously tough yeah as the United nations\nShould relations yeah I mean we're hopeful that here we may be able to hear from a bachelor daddy didn't own the Israeli ambassador to the United nations during the second half hour the broadcasts will keep you posted on that are taking your calls the eight hundred and sixty four thirty one time I Want to ask you a quick question that they are going to throw Mary from eight people are asking already on Facebook\nWhat the confirmation because they've just been through the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process what's this confirmation gonna look like\nObviously depends on who it is Jay but look I think you need expected to be contentious I think you're going to have to\nSomebody that is is qualified ready for the job so that they can get through look I I think this is one of the reasons jade that you're not going to see somebody who is already in a spot that require confirmation because then all of a sudden you have two people that you've got to get through the confirmation process\nI think there's probably going to be somebody that's not in a confirmed spot already and Jay all predict that there's two qualities that Nikki Haley had that the next candidate ... it's got to be somebody that's tough as nails\nBecause they've got to go into this venue and be prepared for people to walk out when their advantage or gender or but then they're going to also have to have that diplomatic characteristic that Jordan's talking about Nikki Haley leaves it very well liked inside the United nations and that's tough to do when you're advancing it engendered as aggressive as she has she's\nBeen very effective uh Elena based books that Nikki Haley resolving stripped changed the position of viewing the bachelor we need something like that to fill that role I think I think ... exactly right here I think that's\nPrecisely correct so we need someone like Nikki Haley someone who is a clear coat your it advocate of tough American policies someone who demands respect on the world stage\nAnd someone that advance our interests how hard do you think the confirmation fight for this one could be the person but it's very hard I could be very hard difficult and this will like this will be after ... [noise] yeah so I think they'll determines a\nAs what happened another impact on the river and let me see if we could [noise] to control the U.S Senate though it'd be a tough confirmation but not as tough Supreme Court which is what\nWe're taking your calls the one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tennis 'cause we're here for another thirty minutes if we're not going to pull out of the broadcast discovered ACL Jay that over audio and video streaming their same on Facebook and periscope in our social media platforms\nAnother way for you to hear the broadcasts we encourage you to do that\nAs well at a a seal jaded over Facebook and periscope I mean if you want to talk to us eight hundred sixty\nFour thirty went back with more in a moment\nRefreshingly Chris dating cool nights our favorite time of year is here at the company store dot com our thought they're turning to the comforts of home like stopped flannel sheets lofty down counterfeiters fluffy towels and cozy sleep where how with the company store dot com friends and family event going on now\nYou enjoy free shipping and twenty five percent off your next to order there's no better time to shop needed the company store dot com and enter family Eighteen I check out for twenty five percent off plus free shipping from our family and your eyes that company store dot com live from\nWashington DC secular old I send\nThings heck of a lever internal and I think you have to be with enough for now when you walk around someone else have I have\n\nNo chief counsel for the American Center for law and justice\nThe gambling houses that you will be resigning at the end of the year as her position as you investors you served for two years and that's\nA that's a significant amount of service it's a big sacrifice for the government officials when they go into government service like this financially uh it's it's you know it's an expensive undertaking as you can imagine\nBut she's been a very effective one of our most effective advocates in us history I think Nikki Haley will go down as one of those affected un ambassadors in us history I have no education and saying that\nThe I mean think about what we've done I mean the U.S has accomplished under ambassador Haley we recognize\nJerusalem as the capital of Israel finally and we take it to the world and say you know what a a you can condemn is do you what\nAre you better watch your aid money uh we've changed the u._s. foreign policy approach to diplomacy where we used to just throw money out um even in countries that would oppose is that the wind oppose our foreign policy\nAnd to throw money out to try to appease them and that has been changed uh so the the tone or it's been ... I Would say it's not just the tone change from the Obama administration it is a complete\nLee new approach to diplomacy at at the United nations that has been done by any previous administration in modern history what do you think Harry\nWell um I think that's absolutely correct I think it's important to recognize that during a Nikki Haley's tenure the United states has withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal\nWe have responded with top rhetoric to North Korea and that has drawn I'm a real loss and we'll continue to impose sanctions on\nA mini regimes including Russia Iran and North Korea and I think that has drawn a real response of throughout the world\nOut of the level of respect for the United states has risen immeasurably we are getting a lot of calls are a lot of ... notes posted on Facebook and periscope a fan about what's gonna happen let's walk people through 'em\nBut what the process looks like the this is another one I mean we just came out of accomplishment Supreme Court justice ambassadors are also confirmed and this is the president nominates that's his authority\nSenate advice and consent\nWhen we've already heard from the president on this day that he expects to give us a name and the next two or three weeks he said maybe sooner he said he's down to a handful of names already but once he decides\nUh yes it will be sent to the Senate\nOr there will be there'll be confirmation hearing to we'll go to the floor I think Jordan is correct that it's not going to follow the protracted timeline of the Supreme Court nomination ah but yeah I Do expect it just it just because of the nature of the Senate right now I expected to vote margin or will be slim I think that whoever is nominated will probably get all of the Republican support\nAnd probably a handful of Democrats so it probably won't be as razor close is is pretty in court but look I think you saw the play by play book from the minority in the United States Senate right now up until the elections and maybe even following Jay they plan to oppose any one significant who's nominated regardless of who they are\nI mean during that were just taught me that I think that look we can it can be a bruising process is going to depend on who it is now the president is going to he he picks people that are going to carry the agenda administration forward of core you almost starting with forty eight objects before you start yes I think the votes going to be close I think we just went through a really horrendous\nProcess for the Supreme Court and\nAnd so a comparing it to that is is is probably not fair it to get it is always the person is ... is qualified\nThey will be confirmed um let's just let's just issues you know about that that uh again it appears that the city or remain in Republican hands and will be the key 'cause that's what this will happen is after the midterm elections either after\nThose people are in place so it's because she's staying until the end of the year so that that means it will be the next Congress that will be confirming a this uh this investor to the ...\nI I think good look I I spent all of a fight but a report that because it's a very very important role All right we're gonna take more calls me come back from breaks up your online hang on we're beauty right after the break if you want to talk to us wonder what do you think about the UN would be important issues are what do you think about the gay Lee said you're twenty eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten\nBraver friends in the panhandle of Florida it's a monster storm coming on about an hour and a half again we'll take your calls at one eight hundred sixty four three one one zero Dover gets more and more can be a seal Jay you could do that at ACL Jay dot org but boy we're praying for you in the winds of a hundred and fifty miles an hour is going to depend most of the morning\n[noise]\nAnd I want to answer [noise]\n... do you need ... earlier ... we had ... cat down right before Khamenei pie\nThat trailer crash happened here we had people leaking all over the expressway and retell out they're really trying to get paid for clean not without the rain now in our area that ride he ... he jak math\nAvoided it hadn't gotten there yet because that GM now backing rethink heating the granny gear and highly not really looking that bad path out because I had him get on there at least out and try to avoid that as\nWell get a check 'em at Fort ... interest here we bend the traffic in the ...
