nomination this will be the vote the up or down vote\nOn whether or not judge Kavanaugh becomes justice Kavanaugh you need fifty one votes the vice president came cast the fifty first vote if necessary there was concern that one Republican sitter had a daughter's wedding to attend a tomorrow he made clear\nA sitter day that he will fly back to Washington DC tomorrow evening if necessary to be the vote 'em to be that fifty or fifty first vote so that is no longer a a really a concern\nI let me say this before we get into kind of all of the what ifs as well I told you yesterday that again they're not related to the Democrats they only had one ... defection ... all the rest including some who are facing very tough political battles\nIn states Donald Trump won and Republicans traditionally win state wide and um they just all the ... decided to vote against cloture\nAnd let me read some of these comments that came out there were the word temperament I said listen for that from Democrats here senator Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota she's a no vote now she was one that used to be in that group of five to say and talks about always that or potential for a vote for judge Kavanaugh no longer now\nShe says last Thursday's hearing called into question judge Kavanaugh's Kurt temperament\nShe's voting no the Washington Post editorial board which is no surprise opposing judge cabinet and calling for a no vote\nOr says that his judgment and temperament would be in doubt the New York times just comes out and call him a jerk seriously that's the term they use they call judge capital a jerk Senator Feinstein says that he's angry and aggression and the aggression so talking about two permits she didn't use the word but Senator Schumer did\nQuestion the confidence to judge Kavanaugh has the temperament center Durban\nUm uh it's asked we put on the ... how could you trust his temperament center Doug Jones the Democrat from Alabama also a show to permitted to becoming a judge and Senator Patrick Leahy a he has neither the judgment or the temperament that is just a sample again\nAnd they're not going to let up on this folks I think that the seats we made very clear to you that we have a time period here it's more than twenty four hours for like thirty hours where people like Jeff Flake and Susan Collins um are are going to be under immense pressure as well as Joe Manchin\nOf from both sides but especially the left right now who is flooding the offices in Washington DC and obviously did have the impact of Lisa Murkowski so they they said um I think with the white Lisa Murkowski explained she was the only Republican vote no on culture\nIs she decided she was walking into the Senate chamber a right before we went on the air and they had that vote that those protesters did have an impact so I don't think they can impact every senator I think that they probably don't have as much of an impact on someone like Joe Manchin of West Virginia especially with Hollywood liberals\nProtesting but they did on in Alaska Senator\nSenator from Alaska Lisa Murkowski now the big question of today is what will Joe Manchin say what will um what will Susan Collins say she's already scheduled a press conference and we'll just like\nSay anything or do we go into tomorrow it it really still not have a clear indication that the votes are there for\nBrett Kavanaugh saying right before I get to the phones I just want to make it kind of clear to people you need fifty one votes\nUm he got that today to give to cloture if those votes held he would be confirmed without the need for the vice president he could lose one more\nAnd the vice president could be the fifty for ...\nYeah that's right joined in fact if everybody votes as they did today the way this would probably go down as the vote tally would probably actually be fifty to forty nine\nBecause Steve Danes will not have you back in Washington DC now now you're absolutely correct he said if his vote is needed he will fly back in time to cast it so if you play that hypothetical out so you did you know Jeff Flake or Susan Collins or Joe Manchin\nA flip to know the final tally when it is initially taken will probably be forty nine to fifty but\nThey won't close that vote Jordan and then in that scenario you would see Steve Gaines get on a plane to come back from Montana and at the same time the vice president would have to make its way out to the Senate chamber show if everybody votes as they did today I expect it would be a fifty to forty nine confirmation and if you see the tally\nA sort of come to a close at forty nine to fifty then it's going to be held held open for several hours to get Steve Gaines backdoor and\nAll right I don't want to put words in a sitter college math but she's having this press conference which to me is unique because she she indicated one way by voting yes on culture I think she could have let that stand\nBut she decided to have a after do press conference then hypothetically you lose Susan Collins and if you assume that these Murkowski that's which you could vote or you didn't have to rely on a job at should to save this nomination [noise]\nYeah I I think that the perilous or Jordan I mean I Know there's a lot of reporting out right now the Joe Manchin has a pretty solid yes because of his race because of how popular judge Kavanaugh is in the state and maybe even some speculation of a party changing after the elections but Jordan\nThat's a very tenuous place for this nomination to be no I won't tell you that it's absolutely impossible for that to happen\nBut look if you go down to the floor of the Senate and the final vote is forty nine to fifty and you're starting to fly Steve the Danes back from Montana like we just talked about and you're starting to bring the vice president over to cast a tie breaking vote can you can you imagine\nThe pressure that would be an Joe Manchin during those hours while that Bo was held open and the delay was hanging on his vote look it might happen but that that\nIs not the best path to nomination for judge Kavanaugh the best path to nominate a confirmation for judge Kavanaugh is to hold Jeff Flake vote and hold Susan Collins vote and by the way during there there is some reporting coming out right now that Jeff Flake is holy orders that he's a yes on Kavanaugh\nUnless something changes yeah again\nThe typical jeopardy you're saying but I mean bright things can change the thirty hours of\nA debate right now it's just started last hour or so or Jeff Flake is a waiver yes uh but still is leaving it out there to be persuaded to vote against\nAh the nomination I did want to it's just one called the companies I think this may be a incorrect information may be some confusion with names as well or something that would be totally breaking those ... has to report it looks good Roberta in Colorado on line for Roberta welcome to Jay said he'll live\nHigh it's I heard correctly Cory Gardner is thirty now and I'm encouraging Colorado and please call Gardner's office and encourage them to vote yes for cap now\nYeah I think that's incorrect information he's a Republican from Colorado I think you might be confusing or you're in Colorado but don't confuse the Cory there's also Cory Booker in New Jersey fan who was definitely a no vote but I've not got any courtyard whether yes he was a yes vote\nOn cloture he has not indicated all that he'd be no votes on Capitol\nYeah I think he's a yes on final Jordan I mean there there there was some reporting last night that he was still undecided as of last night but he has since announced his vote so you'll either there's some confusion with Cory Booker\nOr more maybe as thinking back to that story of last night you know there were there were several senators yesterday that came out and sort of made their first public statements like Ben Sasse you know he had some problems with the process but his boat was never in debt and ... and I think that's the category put Cory Gardner and I don't think he's somebody you have to worry about at this point\nAt that point if those votes started dropping a you've you've you've got the nomination is duped um so you know you've got to really be able to focus in on these final hours which we've got some questions about these final hours to than we have to be the focus in these final hours uh because if you got everybody out there is ...\nEssentially listen because they voted for cloture and that was their first kind of comment on it and they haven't been one of the people who have hung themselves out as I'm undecided throughout the whole process\nUm you know may have they said so they'd twenty four hours but then they voted\nOr you can't focus there because if you do focus they're literally that means you've got serious trouble with a nomination I don't think that's the issue right now I think the issue is these handful of senators but let me play this up both Rhonda on Facebook who wrote and please explain the thirty our weight dawn on Facebook writes why can't they hold the final vote today than\n[noise] yes so do the way you get over a filibuster or a never ending debate on anything Jordan whether it's a nomination or legislation you have to come to some sort of agreement to end the debate now if you can't get unanimous consent for that which obviously they could not get in this case\nUh you have to end debate through a process that's called cloture that which was the vote today was to end debate but uh the rules of the Senate said for that if if culture is invoked which it was today that still allows for thirty\nMore hours posts cloture of debate so you know there'll be there'll be senators down on the floor debating this nomination it probably won't be wall to wall Jordan but that thirty our clock is in a Senate precedent\nAnd even with cultures invoke you cannot move to have a final vote unless there is unanimous consent now it it could be possible Democrat you and your back some of their time I think it's unlikely in this case but essentially unless Democrats agree to hold it sooner they can't have it for another thirty hours\nAll right so I Hope that answer your questions for Iran has done if you get does as part of the standard procedure one eight hundred six eight four thirty wanted to talk to us on the air that's one eight hundred sixty four thirty one Ted just in case you're just joining us Brett Kavanaugh gets through this first a major hurdle for the ...\nWhich is the cloture vote or he got through all the the smallest margin is possible fifty what forty died but it did require the vice president to come in and cast a vote so there's still a sub wiggle room there for the final vote\nWas not about the allegations that temperament and as I read you told us they listen for the words to prevent it appears in uh all these no votes\nStatements city that senator Heidi Heitkamp which I think she's good by North Dakota of the Washington Post editorial board that says to vote no uses to prevent a New York times editorial board just called him a jerk a very very uh very uh\n... it's just a bit absurd these are the kind of terminology at Senator Feinstein a angered aggression is how she explains it should wear uses temperament Durban uses ... Doug Jones' Alabama uses temperament sodas Patrick Leahy plenty of others have as well as just kind of\nA sample for you as well this is a good word coming from Facebook talked with Saudi and one eight hundred six eight four thirty one too that's one eight hundred six eight for three one was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jay Sekulow Live!", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "05"}
