apps\nContests promotions on demand higher\nOn your smartphone free download the items or Android app\nThis is liberty nation\nBack to liberty nation on the radio America network I'm Greg aromas news director of radio American co host of the three martini lunch broadcast filling in for him again this week similar back next week joining me as usual Scott ... legal affairs editor at liberty nation dot\nWith a full list of juicy legal topics for us this week and Scott thanks so much for being with us\nThinking Greg well let's start with where we left off last week and that's what the Brett Kavanaugh nomination that was last weekend that the Senate voted fifty to forty eight to advance\nThe nomination to confirm it he's now justice Brett Kavanaugh and in the wake of this because we knew what the vote would be pretty much for about twenty four hours before the final vote the reaction from cabinet opponents has been interesting and we're going to look at this and a couple of different ways\nOne of the things you don't usually expect is for people to attack the system\nOf the attack the constitution that's put us in that position for how these things get resolved for example the Senate has the advice and consent role when confirming\nJudicial nominees but on the left they're pointing out that while the Republicans have seats in states that's only forty four percent of the population that that shouldn't be that way why do we have the set up the way it is when tiny states have the same say as big states like California and New York\nAnd then you also have a going all the way back to why President Trump even gets to make this a an appointment this nomination he won the electoral college we didn't win the popular vote why do we even have these things so what do you make of this going back to the arguments behind our founding document\nAll you know I I like to to a poke a little that Tim and the side a little bit sometimes I'll do the same for you Greg you said you started off the segment by saying that you are confident in knowing what the vote would be twenty\nI think the only person who says I reached video hosts borders on this uh seems like most people did it so uh but in any case ah yeah I think that the the recent attacks\nOn the sound of the new the decision are so hilarious because they're so transparent um it it I think most famously it was the one of the ... the higher Google guys who said a abolish the Senate ah this is a great\nYou know a great solution at the reason why it's just so transparent is you know there are\nA six hundred and ... called seven hundred thousand people who live in Washington DC and if you ask the average leftist to DC you should have statehood they'll tell you yes absolutely they should as they did so then\nThe seven hundred thousand people in DC we have the same number of votes in the U.S out of the twenty eight million people in Texas right [noise] um it's they don't have a problem with that because the accidents and Republicans to the Senate by and large in D.C the presumption is would send Democrats to the Senate by and large so\nThis idea that it's about fairness I think is wrong it's also wrong that it seems like a lot of our students are being taught that fairness as an important part of the the sort of rubric that our constitutional system when in fact\nIt was deliberately unfair you know the\nThe notion that rural votes and an urban votes might be treated differently a and that a state you know like Delaware is also a akin to California and it's equal in his first state those are on equal measures so we don't have\nA direct democracy we have a constitutional republic which protects the rights of the minority and that's why it was designed that way to protect those right so we start taking down these fundamental pillars of our of our system I think you know you mentioned was a two for two hundred and forty now years the Senate there's been ah doing his job um it gets pretty scary\nYeah Seventy eighty seven we put this together or read it but uh to really start people that don't have the finished ...\nWe'd better there I think I think it's appropriate to say we right I mean in America is the one place in the world where we are a weather and we have bloodlines or not that's our direct legacy of of of freedom I think so I like that term\nAbsolutely so real quick follow up we're still hearing Democrats talk about if they take back the\nHouse next month and the mid term elections come January we're going to get a fuller investigation into Brett Kavanaugh uh there's also some talk that mean for Michael ... so even most of the Democrats aren't necessarily ah drinking this yet but uh he's talking about court packing bubbling up to eleven justices of the five\nRight leaning justices now don't make up a majority of that goes through a what do you make of those tactics\nYeah the ... thing Israeli he gets more popularity I think that the Democrats seem to be of a mind like where well if he can bring the votes and the money then we're going to include them in our club but if not then no and he was a real stink or\nA of an accusation of his with um the Kavanaugh hearings and he's got a lot of sort of digging to do or or or Philly in that hole I should say I'm so we'll see about that as far as impeachment goes you know one of the things that people don't realize\nIf Democrats win the majority that then they get the subpoena power so they have the ability to directions legal subpoenas and and compel testimony and that's why it will cause a mess and some have said they will vote for or or try to move for capital of the peach and I\nThink that'll tear the country apart and for that reason whether or not he perjured himself or not I just hope they don't do it just because I think it will really lead to\nA just just a massive amount of of discord in the country on a level that we haven't seen in ... and a lot of years\nTalking with Scott could send the legal affairs editor at liberty nation dot com and ah one of the ways that uh the Democrats could make life difficult for President Trump and others as you just mentioned is through winning back the majority in the house or the Senate or both\nMost likely the house if they're going to win anywhere uh but also one place where they're making a big play especially with some\nPretty strong liberal activists is in races for state attorneys general and we're going to be seeing a lot of those races around the country and you're following a story where a New York University School of law program funded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg who this week\nBecame a Democrat officially and it probably thinking about running for president is placing lawyers in the offices of democratic state attorneys general and paying them to prosecute energy companies\nAnd challenged Trump Administration policies on energy\nAnd environment so obviously they're going to win and some states some of them fairly prominent state so\nThat sounds like the courts are going to be pretty clogged here in the next two years at least\nWe have seen a disturbing trend Greg of\nState attorneys general using their office to promote a political ideology\nA it's a political position so we can't divorce it entirely from politics\nSo that the people's preferences with respect to their law enforcement priorities are honored but there's bald political like basically that to to this climate change lawsuit stuff that we saw again Bloomberg uh funded with a little touch of um [noise] what's his name from uh from New York everybody's favorite bugaboo Soros excuse me\nUm and this privately funding a public attorneys general though I think is very dangerous we know that Mr Bloomberg has\nSome very anti liberty positions but even if we agreed with those positions it's not appropriate for private actors to fund prosecutors even if there is no direct a influence because we know there will be in direct influence and that's an inappropriate influence on somebody that has the power to bring prosecutions in the name of the state\nJust a couple of minutes left in our conversation here so let's move now to Massachusetts that's where a conservative nonprofit that plans to attacks to attack Massachusetts taxes in a pre election ad brought\nA federal complained Wednesday to keep its donors secrets\nRepresented by Foley Hogan the Institute for free speech the Massachusetts fiscal alliance would fall under the state's reporting scheme merely because it plans to mention state a state senator in an ad so uh the from the fight over your eye here is I guess who you can mention and what that constitutes in terms of the law\nAnd then once again it looks like a knowing who the donors are\nIs a big priority the laughter kind of reminds us of the ... [noise]\nYou know you wonder why is it so important for them to know who donors are when we know that politicians have said they want to reward their backers and punished their opponents using law and regulation and that's why it's important for these people to\nGood conceal their identity they don't want government actors punishing them for exercising their free speech and that's all we're talking about here they're saying to their fellow Massachusetts ...\nHey it's not okay to levy an additional tax on people simply because they're wealthy uh they pay more money anyway right they're making more so they're paying more but they shouldn't have a separate an additional burden over and above everybody else's burden simply because they are very successful\nAnd they should be able to the you know the pro freedom position as they should be able to say that that sense um without having identified themselves because they're fearful of them Massachusetts taxing authority is right\nI I think what people need to realize that when people like Cory Booker said get up in their face\nAnd he may think that that's okay but what do you have to realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face when I was going to be an stable enough to commit violence we don't want to encourage that we have to somehow ratchet down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK\nEver reason for or a means we're trying to wrestle\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation those who are actually getting their face to realize that they are some responsibility of ...\nWild Michael Savage to more hands on and immediate approach\nDo you believe and people should be deemed a terrorist or domestic terrorist organization\nI think they have declared themselves to be a terrorist organization last week we saw a on the Drudge Report a link where they claimed that they were going to pretend during the day they were for all the people\nBut at night they were going to engage in activities of assassination towards their political enemies meaning all those who are not communists and the leftist about any kind\nA I'm Talking assassination\nMission went out from antifa people they're absolutely domestic terrorist group what else would anyone call them\nSo what what should the attorney general what should the FBI which they do about that well if you're a terrorist organization\nWe have a department of homeland security deli if you have a a group within the United states that said they're going to assassinate political enemies your round up the leadership and arrest them what else do you have to wait for them to kill people\nMeanwhile Trump arrangements syndrome and the fast approaching mid term simple left to do a blood thirsty rampage\nOn the heels of the Kavanaugh national disgrace the Democratic staffer accused of leaking personal details of GOP lawmakers during the Kavanaugh hearings was ordered held without bond on Tuesday\nAdditionally investigators said they've found cocaine and methamphetamine during a search and claim ... may have been under the influence with according to them used his credentials to dock several lawmakers by leaking their personal addresses and phone numbers and Maxine Waters continued to manipulate the Democratic base while denying any sense of wrongdoing\nWe're not going to allow them to take this last message that they're trying to carry to the American people trying to make them believe that we're angry mob when I got to let them get away with that\nCannot be ... with a political party that wants to destroy the fans for what you care about that's why I Believe as we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and the words that plane since ... can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and versus strength\nWhat do you think of that well I like that and we are not saying we got to kill anybody we gonna hit anybody oh we're going to cause anybody in a harm that's a lot\nI have an awful lot about blowing up the White House [noise]\nHillary Clinton and Eric fast and furious holder lit a fuse so dangerous they will have to be held accountable for the uncertain chaos ahead meanwhile that chaos is unfolding\nFBI agent today continued searching home just north of New York city where yesterday they discovered to hundred pound bombs prosecutors St Paul Rosenfeld plan to detonate a bomb in Washington DC on election day he allegedly wanted to kill himself and attention to his political beliefs\nAs someone who says that you don't want your name goes oh\nThey go low we go [noise]\n\nWas the Democratic or any of the national\nReview s who will save the Democrats from their leaders writing when they go low that's where they are sure to find or colder sometimes\nThe former attorney general is helping a Democratic president commute the sentence is a hard left terrorists who's only regret was failure to shoot it out against police interrupted another bombing spree in their war against the United states but if there's anyone who knows about\nGoing lo is Mr holder years after all the first attorney general in American history to be held in contempt of Congress empty pose following Hillary and holders advice to the letter writing our attack\nIs merely a beginning you're not passive we're not civil and we will not apologize those are good conscience and clear mind no the state of oppression and cannot remain the U.S fascist political system is one of the most Savage institutions in history and we will combat it relentlessly until all our free of American barbarism\nThis after vandalizing the New York city GOP headquarters hey Democrats we did it you hate America\nAnd everyone enjoying its freedoms\nOr what's left of them John bound

of really gigantic news here\nBut I Do want to hype up when you're going to learn the next hour I have made quite a few phone calls to forces I have the military forces in Washington and I've been a lot of research last week and I tell my Tom soldiers sure about what was going on with the murder of this very prominent sigh harsh level\nSaudi journalist\nAnd then when I talked to a frequent guest on the show Zack who's been in the military in special operations and also a lot of prominent people like Kanye West and\nThe lawn mosque and others are confirmed that separately with what are those

they don't their names on there but they were confirming\nAnd he laid out what I was thinking was going on but I wasn't sure a week ago but what I separately got when I called other individuals sort of what you've been on the show before but because I get so much trouble when they come on they don't come on now people could probably think to some of those folks might be\nHave this from a lot of people very high level what happened\nAnd why they're hyping this show big murder the journalist them and how it ties into mad as the word that he\nMay be leaving according to Trump uh and uh the Iran
