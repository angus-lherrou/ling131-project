four thirty one Ted\nI showed you the differential that he made regarding Korea North Korea specifically a but he also said if the ... not only was it a about these dictators but it was also about America's role in the world let's play a number twenty to\nAmerica will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance control and\nDomination by honor the right of every nation and there's room to pursue its own customs beliefs and traditions the United states will not tell you\nHow to live or work [noise] for worship [noise] we only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return\nSo how do you how do you read that one area I mean I Would I say it's and again we'll take your calls an eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten is that the president is still making it clear that we're not leading from behind but that we're not engaging in every global conflict either\nAbsolutely so one of the things that the president emphasized in his speech is that the rest of the world has to respect us sovereignty\nUs in ... the president of the United states is putting American citizens interest first rather than the interests of global elites\nAnd that is true in a number of arena including a international trade and dealing for instance with Iran and be a rainy and move us he\nIs not prepared to continue to send cash\nTo Iran he withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and he is has imposed sanctions on the Iranian regime new sanctions take effect a new November the fifth or twenty Eighteen\nAnd this is placing pressure on the Iranian leaders and the European global is who continue to attempt to prop up the Iranian regime in country distinction to support the Iranian people\nYou know what's interesting about that is that there are reports that the Europeans are meeting to try to figure out ways around the sanctions because they know that if they got to make a choice between doing business with the United states are doing business with the Iranians that's a very\nEasy choice right now and it's it's pretty general but the the us going to put together some vehicles they're calling it a that all the funds would flow through that would somehow a take these cut make these companies immune from us sanctions because most of them would also do business\nHave some financial traction transactions that the U.S because of our banking system being so important their stock market or so that they would create some vehicle that allows a this works that allows them to continue to do business with Iran\nIn violation of the usa should but somehow protects them the truth is though does it you can try all at once the corporations want to make that decision most of the major corporations is Harris pointed out before this broadcast we talked about these sanctions\nHave decided they're not going to risk\nA business with the U.S or us sanctions and having their assets frozen\nOr in the United states or any trades actually goes to the United states to do business with the country that that is large\nBut let me go to a better here I'm going to play in a moment of the president use this phrase America's policy principles realism\nOr we're going to get ... get get that played in a moment but before we do I thin as our un representative or you go to the un you've been there many times are bad usually about people being held captive for their faith but on on other issues as well what is your sense of Capitol Hill reaction and\nWe sing anything yet so far\nA not a whole laundry I think still digesting this speech but I think here's what your gunny here and this is this\nIs certainly would I took away from it for the first time in a long time J I heard a balanced approach with the United nations that said two things that might seem to be in contradictions each other but actually work in harmony on the one hand you heard the\nPresident say we're not going to meddle in your business miniature sovereign a right to engage in an issue but on the other hand Jay he said we're not going to be the world's pocket book so we're not going to find every little program around the world that might not serve American districts we've seen this uh with repeated account\nYou talked about unreal you talking about withdrawing from the human rights council you talked about reducing the UN's contributions to Jay it was the president putting the world in a more appropriate posture leading at United Nations but at the same time not propping up everything I Love this line ... J. he said going forward we will only\nGive to our friends what a novel idea we're going to support those people who are friends into Jordan point J I don't think Europe better go down this line of has the United states resolve on that point\nHuge mistake now interestingly I like this line I'm going to read at first I don't want to play at\nThe president said that aim is it may not harmed by acknowledging the obvious facts America's policy of principle realism means we will not be held hostage to old dog much discredited ideologies on so called experts who have been proven wrong over the years time and time again let's listen to it\nThat aim is advance not harmed\nBy acknowledging the obvious facts America's policy of friends who will realism\nMeans we will not be held hostage ... his credit ideologies and so called experts who have been proven wrong\nOver a year's\nTime and time again you know\nAnd the time and time again is important because let me give you a for instance wintertime replay despite the moment and this is about Jerusalem the president made a very bold move in May of this year\nMoving to recognize the embassy of the United states from Tel Aviv to Israel's eternal capital Jerusalem\nNow there were a lot of advisors previous advisors in previous administrations saying this was disasters this was going to start a third intifada there's gonna be a new war in the middle east\nThe our allies will be angry you cannot move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem with out reshaping the world order I mean it was it was that significant the way people are going to impact the entire\nArab world the entire Muslim world and there'll be no way that this could be reconciled All right so what happened is the president moves the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\nAnd did they did the world collapse did the middle east realignment get injured know who are the allies of Israel right now in the region who are thought this Jordan Egypt Saudi Arabia and a number of the Gulf states\nSo taking Jerusalem off the table as a negotiating chip actually it was really smart so when the president engage that issue he knew exactly what it was going to do it did admit the ball forward\nOut and also those are ... or so called experts thought that the best way to move forward palaces was throwing money\nHundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion dollars a year at all their program so you know what it's gotten us nowhere over decades like the president said so we're not going to go by just the the so called experts were going to cut that funding\nWe recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel would cut off the Palestinians and then we see what changes we it it's all about taking new approaches you don't always know exactly how things will turn out I think would Jerusalem that was a long time\nDecision all the funding of the Palestinians is because what has happened in the past has failed and how many times how many decades of failure do you need on record before you tell the state department we're not letting you do business as usual\nElevate let me let me play the Jerusalem because I think this is very important number thirty seven\nThis year we also took another significant step forward in the middle east\nAnd recognition of\nEvery severance to determine his own capital I Move the U.S embassy in Israel\nThe United states has committed to a future of race and civility in the region including these doing\nThe Israelis and the Palestinians would the president\nDid do and I think this is a very significant by moving the embassy to Jerusalem all we recognize was the obvious its sovereign nation gets to determine its capital ... states is the district of Columbia\nIn Jerusalem that Israel is Jerusalem so we simply recognize what was under the law the right of the Israelis to do and that they did do through their process they determine where their capital was going to be\nNow you take it to the next step in Jordan mentioned to the United nations relief agency which we think it's been a scam on the un and the American people\nBillions of dollars for one is we and we we went to court on this against the state department in one and started getting the reports\nAnd saw the fraud that was involved in this and again the president took Harry decisive action counter two decades of policy advice\nAbsolutely so the president's policy encountered distinction to the prior administrations approach in the middle east has produce results today if you look at the middle east it is quite different than it was even two or three years ago\nThat is you there's only so much you can cover ... but that doesn't mean there's not meetings going on but it's not so much what they say than it is also what these countries actually do\nIt's also what we do behind the scenes as well gee I mean look the president has been very consistent with this call not only for contributions to the UN but also contributions to other programs and let me just give\nOne small example there is a program called the un development program which is supposed to support something that Jordan was talking about the resettlement of refugees who had been displaced by ISIS\nUh Jay this administration has told the rest of the world I'm pulling back a big contribution to the United states is making that program because you all aren't supporting it as you should and guess what I'm going to do I'm going to send it directly to the Christian ... as you use the communities that have been displaced by\nThat is the way he has backed up the words he gave to Jay Jay with action on the ground so as it relates to China if they don't come to the table and contribute in any like fashion the president will just keep pulling the United states dollars back and allocating indirectly\nWhen we come back from the break I Want to get into the issue of the international criminal court the president mentioned that and I've appeared there I Know that when\nA so this is we're able to talk to you about a lot of these issues and said I I had the privilege of being at that podium at the general assembly I've been here before the office of the prosecutor at the un at the international criminal court in the Hague are presenting Israel's interests before the icy state so I've done this\nOr we're talking about that we're talking about the president's comments on globalism and take more of your phone calls at one eight hundred sixty four three one ones here that's eight hundred sixty four\nThirty one time was interesting that the president had this statement the Iranian people again just this is drawing a distinction between the Iranian regime and the Iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have embezzled billions of dollars from Iran's treasury let me play for you sound bite thirty one\nYear rainy and people are rightly outraged\nAt their leaders have embezzled millions of dollars from Iran's fresh [noise] sees\nValue ... of the [noise]\nLooted people's religious and down this all to line their own pockets and send their promises to wage war not good\nThat is from the president the United states speaking at the United\nNations strong words on the Iranian regime we've got thirty more minutes ahead of his broadcast if you don't get the full hour just go to a C. O. J. dot org were screaming at their course on Facebook as Facebook dot com slash Jay Sekulow were periscope you could run if you can get up there as well and we encourage you to do that quite a lot of station now carry the full hour\nFor those of you that are going to be staying with us we've got um coming up [noise] I really want to get into this issue of global is issue the whole international criminal court now that plays into this and we're taking your calls at one eight hundred sixty four thirty one said don't forget to work in the ACL Jay do you do that at ACL's less customer loyalty program\nPoints for purchasing products you me and with human for merchandise trips and more get started in Ferguson dot com [noise] live from\nWashington DC secular law\nNow counsel for the American Center for law and justice secular everyone and welcome back to the broadcast or the president gives a major\nAddress to the United nations I joined decide this during the break through the two that are always the most and dissipated at least for the media or the presidents and the prime minister of Israel\nThat's usually it for me to hear the United states that's where the focus goes ah because you will see a lot of controversy surrounding the prime minister of Israel from ours in the crowd\nThat the United Nations General assembly inside the building\nAnd then of course we want to see our president kind of lay out the foreign policy issues that are the most important but also\nWhat we're doing is seeing our presidents speak to the world this is a a unique time when it's not the president just addressing the nation he does that you know he addresses our nation regularly right this is an address to the world and world leaders that's his audience there\nOf course there are there are things for everybody to pay attention to our Americans to understand the thought process going by a our foreign policy but\nThis is really a statement to the world on where America's going in twenty eight twenty nine tea and where they focused and we're seeing a lot of focus on Iran\nWe're seeing a again I'm the focus on the middle east of the reasons the world that is again still the most uh turmoil I'm ... and then obviously a lot of economics or we haven't gotten into all that there's a lot of economic focus in this speech as well and the idea the America First idea\nBut also saying you should be doing this in your own country to yeah should be looking up your own people's interest stop just joining these global institutions and letting them decide for you your trade deal\nHarry what were you say that you took is the biggest takeaway from the speech\nWell among other things uh one of the biggest pick a ways but I took his the rejection by President Trump of the advice and the approach taken by global\nGlobal is are quite willing to prop up horrendous regimes for instance like the Iranian regime but number one state sponsor of terror\nAnd so the question then becomes how does that approach advance human rights\nCoon by is not a solution maximum pressure in principle realism is\nA solution so the president offered a clear message to global elites who are often willing to trade human lives in pursuit of the illusion that all of the world leaders are actually interested\nIn peace rather than expanding terror and so one of the messages that was clear or to the world and to\nGlobal leaders was we are rejecting past approaches that have failed with respect to Iran with respect to Syria and with respect to any ... regime\nBut ... it's um people's hopes and dreams instead of advancing\nA true peace schooling for America is governed by Americans that's where the president to listen to this\nAmerica is governed\n[noise] we're in jak the ideology of globalism and we embrace that dot\nPatriotism I\nMean this isn't contradicts ... this is the complete opposite man of the way the previous administration address the world we were all part of this you know global ... a world which of course we are part of a global\nOf world but we are protecting here our sovereignty and our ability to determine our own fake it was very strong and very much in distinction the previous administration\nWilling quite frankly Jay that approach is necessary if you want to restore American leadership around the world I mean the president I thought\nUh you know he backed up by saying if their program is not helpful not only to the world but to American interests like unreal like the human rights council\nWe are not going to go along with it just because decades or tradition say that we have to you at the same time J E S U the red lines for Syria we've heard red lines before but I think the rest of the world knows that this president uh now means in won't dare cross stitch so again\nAmerican leadership in the world Jay if you can be resolved to restore that but unless you're committed to back it up with words it won't be able to very far this president will back it up and I think\nThe world knows I we're taking your phone calls at one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten eight hundred sixty four three one two one zero your reaction to the president's strong statements that the United nations and our approach\nIn dealing with global events again one eight hundred six eight for three one one zero again one eight hundred six eight for
