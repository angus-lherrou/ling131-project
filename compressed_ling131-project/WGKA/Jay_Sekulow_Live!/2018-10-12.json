degrees [noise]\n\nI'm not going to broadcast everyone and I'm On the road obviously but I received the call this morning from the president of the United\nStates president girl who told me to have good news um looks like your ... will be coming home to the United states he\nGave me some of the details about that that the government has been obviously working on their release but that what the process would be we'd be going to to military bases that's how these things are handled but I express for the president on behalf of all of our ACL Jay member or the ... family are\n... for his unyielding\nUnyielding a efforts to obtain the pastor's release and of course your prayers and support for the past and let me also say there's\nA I have a lot of idea what the media lot as you know on it in several different capacities outside the ACL Jay but I Need to say this to my friends in the media these reporters up for these uh newspapers that when I'm dealing with other matter of fact but very tied\nIn covering test or a ... case and the story and that helped keep them alive as part of the process when you got\nPeople held like this and I'm a I'm a huge thank you and I told us to a couple of reporters today I appreciate them covering it and continuing to cover it and uh and that that's across the board here a ... and it's been on many networks of Fox News CNN\nOr have covered extensively ab seniors\nAre discovered it I mean I even talked about it with George Stephanopoulos on ABC this week a couple of weeks back so\nA good news on that front and we're thrilled with his release but again if you're just joining oppressor I drew Brunson now being processed out of turkey and what that means is he is they were moving the ankle bracelet which was a monitor it was at a house arrest\nA will be taken to a military transport aircraft uh them probably flown directly after Germany or be evaluated the return to the United states I don't know exactly when that low but will be yet we're ... into that but I'm a will keep everybody posted as this progress progress over the next several hours but a great\nDay uh on any time you get these releases like this door to a great day we're still waiting for the baby that case was earlier this week I Know this way way up to them but yeah that they are there were reports this morning that that could be coming at any moment yeah I'm Out of the package in the great to\nGo ahead out of the Pakistani U.S Supreme court that that case here or what happened pastor Brunson ultimately was ordered I is that is unique in similar in these situations\nAs time served all the witnesses against fascism burns who basically dropped their stories this morning in court in Turkey um and said they were there was they were not accurately reported as a as a what they had accused pastor Brunson of\nAnd ah and then ultimately the prosecutor a recommended in Turkey that he be allowed to travel or the ... no longer under judicial order and so that's why the ankle brace will be coming off or is coming off as we speak right now his house released a house arrest\nWill be released and ultimately will be given his passport and able to travel and and we have planes on doing that um later on today\nA in Turkey I just to remind you this is someone who spent two years and containment a year and a half of that in prison\nBecause of his Christian faith a pastor been there for twenty three years in Turkey in American I raised his family has three children he'll be reunited with the United states ah two sons and one daughter his daughters spoken out a very publicly for her father even going to the United nations in Geneva or\nSo again I I've heard of his uh as a sister on a as well so there's a family\nWhich is very excited to uh to see past her Bronx is released it was a long and difficult process more difficult than it should have been with a NATO ally like turkey these and that was not like a situation\nI'm In Iran or North Korea right by a with how complicated it God I'm an because an American citizen dead I figure it's just as big of a deal\nOr to see his freedom or saw everybody's a ... who was innocent and persecuted because their face it doesn't matter what countries doing it what relationship to us may have with that country or their release is something to celebrate\nWhat look absolutely and we're thrilled with the outcome here and I hope this also goes a long way in restoring relations\nBetween the United states and turkey Turkey's been an important ally of NATO ally and they play up strategic role in the region and it would be good to see those relations are stored and this is a positive step is a secretary Pompeo said it very positive step it met restoration process having said that also let me just say that this also gives you a glimpse\nAnd I'm going to go to bed on this gives you a glimpse of that nature which we have all these cases that was a unique situation here in that\nUm we had a situation where we had a NATO allies Jordan said that took custody of an American so a NATO ally taken custody of an American pastor\nIt happened to be also at the very same time but that pastor was a ... in jail his family contacted us we immediately began a representation of him that predated my representation of the president but then of course now represents and at ... for over a year and a half now about a year now representing the president the United states\nAnd so it gave us a unique perspective on it and\nUh I think it was helpful for the past year or two to have an advocate that could obviously a speak with the president but having said that this president has been\nVery very assertive on regarding sausages that are Americans back to the United states and is that a great track record there\nBut it was a unique perspective for me it we've had a lot of these over the years but this was a little bit unique in that sense but again I when I got back all the president this morning I was just a really delighted with the with the news that we wanted to convey that I'd be set up a a video on Facebook immediately\nWe sent out a report boards or social media outlets as well but we're glad now that we're talking with our our radio audience than I think it's important for you to state the nature of\nThe bipartisan ship that was involved in this and what we were able to accomplish on a legislative level that help move is all\nWell I think it was particularly important given the fact that you just pointed out that this was an ally of the United states that we had a vested interest in maintaining a good relationship with so today we're grateful to both countries but you're right Jay this was a little bit different in that regard first of all it was important for the administration\nTo speak with one voice the vice president the president the secretary state ambassador brown back being in the courtroom Jay but then in Congress I mean I I\nI Would first give a it gave me a tip of the hat to senator Jeanne Shaheen Democrat from New Hampshire who went over to turkey herself and J I Will tell you was extremely engage behind the scenes\nBoth on putting pressure on turkey when when it was appropriate but then also engaging diplomatically with turkey and reassuring turkey did the United states wanted a strong relationship with him and and free and pastor Andrew Brunson was the best way to accomplish that and so you know there was sort of the a team of four senator Lankford senator tell us who went down to the floor the United\nStates Senate every single week for the past several months\nTo speak on behalf of the pastor and Senator Graham but Jay a multiple letters multiple congressional testimony a pastor Brunson daughter came\nTo Congress to testify visits to turkey engaging diplomatically and also with your pressure means by camera all bipartisan and all of them gay speaking with one voice in the United states government a behind the president\nAnd at the same time you say you're my uh came our team your teeth are that are listening and members of the AC OJ your team at the ACL Jay bad bet it is him in DC a grave or ...\nA team at the European Court of law and justice engaging un on multiple occasions or so we're very happy that are very happy with the way this tape\nCame out a Logan team that was in charge of the media and social media races a year steak your toward tire team we want where we said we utilize all the lawyers\nOr government affairs professionals are mediate professionals social media professionals video media proposals everyone engaged in this top to bottom\nA and I think your door tired they literally are steps in all those I Would say every office or that we have around the globe was involved in one way or another with this uh effort so I'm a great great result\nYeah that's right and we have our one of our lead attorneys here in the United states other matters cc has been very busy today on the phone with the with the family coordinating everything now that they have gotten to this day that they were waiting for hoping foreign praying for as we know so many of you were praying for\nIncluding let me think the five hundred thousand a six hundred and seven people almost six hundred thousand people who sign on to the petition to free uh American pastor Andrew Brunson or\nAt our our team again all of those efforts to grassroots efforts here in our country\nOr the legal efforts the efforts abroad by our European and uh other affiliates of the American Center for law and justice this is all because of a your support of the ACL Jake that we're able to do these kinds of cases of this kind of scale and help the family\nAnd represent the Brunson Brunson or in this manner\nAnd ... with no charge or to them and to take this again and ultimately again we were able to work with our government in a way that his was more dish cope with the previous administration but the current the Trump Administration\nA sister talking about that how important of a ally turkey is the United states and that you shouldn't have this kind of relationship so that's very important to send your grand was talking about that\nAs well I I just want to underscore to all of you\nAre thanks and how how important it is to stay with it these are tough cases they take us a long time that a ... you try diplomatic options um you could uh we had a White House in a president willing to take steps are\nAfter diplomacy or or was not working just to get it done to even issue things like us a targeted sanctions on Turkish officials or to see the release of past\nFor Andrew Brunson and I cannot underscored enough um how important it is that all of you stood by for those two years I'm a pastor Brunson I Know he sang shoo\nAnd his family things shoe and as usual in these situations though he realized because in Turkey it was such a big story\nUm I think he will come to realize even more so over these next twenty four forty eight hours how many people were following his story almost on a daily basis here in the United states and certainly when they were updates on every news network\nA route or many different broadcast shows are some that will be doing later today who ... who stood with this story\nI Would this American pastor because of his wrongful imprisonment I've got
