this meeting with someone that maybe it's a client prospect when you have as you put it the social lubricant in front of you\nKnow what better way to get to know the person the business mind the collaborative the artist behind someone that you may work directly or indirectly with or potential keep it as a as a business contacts then exchange ideas you know it's been twenty to thirty minutes sitting down\nAnd when you get that face to face meeting as you put it when my mind was invented as a community\nTool facilitator it establishes trust and respect right but when there's trust and respect to ... then you end up doing business with people and we all know this because I did as a civil meant for company before this and for four years we always wanted to go out there in our clientele and\nWhen you do the productivity increases because you get commitments project commitments time commitments and so forth and so the problem we're solving is digital connections are not professional relationships you know so you mentioned before you're you're we're talking about your Lincoln before David so when you get an accept or ignore\nInvitation crumbling ten number sometimes that might not amount to anything right and so what we're trying to do is bridge that gap that missing piece and where\nThat connection now actually means something to you in terms of your experience with that person the feeling the vibe you got you know for you to in order to continue business\nWell we had a show on a couple of weeks ago the main guest that I had on was the author of a book that was about speaking human and the gist of that conversation is we are becoming less human all the time because we do everything on line we\nDo everything in little short word bites you know whether it's Twitter or just a simple message through your iPhone and we've lost that human touch and I think that\nThe idea of getting face to face once again with people and adding\nA social element to it is something\nThat we have really really lost touch with absolutely ... on ...\nThese days ... phone to her laptop and then if if someone can't reach you live via phone than the voicemail has that

midpoint I'm doing here but that's one of the time we have a yeah I'm Glad this is going well for you I'm going to be keeping an eye on you for a long time and\nAny experts to bring them to ease into tomorrow\nHears the grave lies\nWeekend of October twelve twenty eight team your tune in to tomorrow I Am Dave grave line I'm Chris Wray line yes indeed and the control room there are small in New York working with the show is her ratio\nAnd in Naples this week working with the show is bad but we're all here one way or the other to bring you further into tomorrow to help solve your digital delivers to address your calls and occasional emails but mostly calls because we want to hear you on the show you make the show\nBy calling in any time at the number of course is about to give you were just toll free by the way from anywhere in North America\nSome people's Skype into it from around the world or otherwise why calling from Timbuktu even works whatever the case\nOr or wherever you may be where you have a digital dilemma let us help ... hopefully and help police off it for you that number would be here I've got a pen eight hundred\nEight nine nine four six eight six nobody one more time translates to eight hundred eight nine nine\nInto a very fine subject there was a commentary and then we will get to those out for mentioned the calls\nI Want to start off this week on a soapbox though and I don't mean to get political but there's apparently a lot of news lately about um undercover cops getting in trouble because they create Facebook profiles that aren't quote unquote real\nTo sort of get in with gangs and protesters and try to find the bad actors and you know ... as a former police officer I think that's perfect because that's how you work undercover and I agree with you know however the American civil liberties union says not\nOkay and the point would be so what else has no they apparently they they have sued the tennis police roaming a tendency for allegedly violating in Nineteen Seventy eight agreement that prohibited pleas from conducting surveillance ... lawful protest\nIf we have so many different site if you asked me that's not surveillance snow you know and and I don't I I think following someone on Facebook or you offending putting information you're not surveilling anybody you just because when you think about it when you're on Facebook there's no privacy so what is there to serve veil and [noise] you know I don't as a former cop and you know I Know how you feel about it but\nYou're wondering how our audience for you yeah well I think that's a good question eight hundred eight nine nine into what do you think one way or the other yes or does do you care does it matter you know do you want our law enforcement to be able to infiltrate some of these groups that cause harm or or wreak havoc or otherwise\nYou know and when Facebook finds these pages obviously they close those accounts because it who goes against their rules because it's like a little lake illegal life but if you ask me why wouldn't they want to work with police departments and law enforcement to try to because that's what they're doing they're not ... out there trying to like ... you know ... people in the breaking\nThought you were going to talk about that they're that they feel they're being entrapped or something and not the case it's always used to get a kick when I worked at traffic which I didn't do a whole lot of thank God I did actual police work\nYou know fighting crime and and making arrests and whatnot but occasionally I had a rookie with me I got to teach them how to write a ticket so we do traffic or we do what we call sandbagging a stop sign where you're in the distance maybe you're just watching for people blow and throw it then you pulled him over\nAnd they say that's entrapment how was that entrapment I just didn't make you blow to stop sign if I was on the other side of it waving you through and then wrote you a ticket yeah okay there you go there's your entrapment for your stopped signed blowing\nBut that's not the case if I simply observed it whether I'm hiding\nTo observe it as these undercover officers apparently we're doing in Tennessee with a Facebook account a fake Facebook account they're hiding but they're conducting in this case an investigation\nRight you know an officer who uses an undercover account I'm In New Jersey to monitor gang members and drug dealers says at every high tech crime you know has one and he says it's not uncommon but we don't\nWant to talk about all that of course not if they're not going to say oh by the way this is our account go ahead and friend does especially if you're in the gang\nYeah that's not going to happen and it's not just Facebook either certainly Instagram and and and Snapchat which is so popular with with younger folk of all kinds of things you know Twitter accounts and\nAnd that is very normal that's not at all unusual the FBI does it to got news for you not just police agencies you know local police agencies\nFits all and certainly you can assume the CIA and the NSA and everybody else does it do maybe for different reasons or different international reasons and so forth\nBut similarly as being accomplished you know if you asked me on Facebook to spend more time going after ... and people trying to get personal information and less time you know go after ... or ... how about letting us see our friends post on our own news feed instead of\nFacebook deciding what we should see or not and then we get to see things four and five times as you simply scroll during your morning constitution or something\nAnd totally miss other things that I've talked about some or so before I follow a couple of low or local news TV stations and I'll see a post that was the breaking news but to post the two days ago\nBut I just now seeing is just not as well because it doesn't fit their narrative of course now which is unsurprising\nSo good luck there to the ACLU you know what take it to the Supreme Court that's a good idea to have you seen those means lately to various he some protester going crazy and we're going to take it on the Supreme Court it's like okay well go ahead and speaking\nOf Facebooking Supreme Court I'm sure you've heard about the ... the backlash because of one of Facebook's top execs who was who's been a lifelong friend of of justice Kevin ... yeah and showed up at one of those hearings and it caused a huge uproar there where they had to even held to hold a town hall meeting last friday to to talk to their employees about about this whole issue tolerance\nThat's what it was it was tolerance oh my God [noise]\nYeah well this we are attacked showed up not political but we're talking about tech related things and how tech affects people and opinions and and so forth we'd probably upset a whole bunch of folks now and that's fine but tell us\nWe don't stand by tomorrow supposed ... exactly and it's an F. B. dot com by the way if he didn't know it is is a short cut for Facebook\nBut slash into tomorrow post something on there and and share it with us or call us at eight hundred eight nine nine in to\nKeep it tech related but we want your opinion about it\nAnd we'll probably get you on the air if you keep a tech related if you just want to ranch\nAnd wind and do stuff that we do that is not that Chris we probably won't put it on the air but here we have microphones ... that is true so yeah when you when you grow up and have your own radio show [laughter] you to get tolerance is the key\nI Hope they take that to the Supreme Court now to [noise] I guess Google's hoping that we would all ignore their latest major security issues by announcing a few new products they announce a new pixel three a tablet computer into Google Home speaker was built in display\nCopy elect so much a but Google Plus is finally shutting down I didn't even know it was still a saying well because they've been trying to cover that up along with their other big covering up father my gosh I mean seriously show of hands keep one on the wheel if you're driving how many people have or he would have even been using Google Plus\nNobody thought to three All right that was that\nIn the entire audience so oh my gosh breaking news they're going to shutter a Google Plus and a major security bug allowed hackers to access Google Plus user profiled data since all the way back in twenty Fifteen all the way back three years ago\nBut I probably still had an account I should never used it it was like it's nobody's usually get why should I bother and I never did but they uh\nThey they claim Google discovered and patched it back in March but they didn't bother to tell anyone not letting the public know not letting their members no bad Google I Wonder if you could have Google to find them I don't know maybe since March something would have come up\nA bit if you asked on being you'd probably get some info but maybe Google's hiding it I mean they're trying to they're trying to hide all kinds of stuff to be able to do business in China so why wouldn't they censor\nEverything Chihuahua\nWalmart is trying to pass the design for a biometric feedback cart handle shopping cart full of measuring shoppers heart rate temperature speed and amount of force if they apply to the handle as they walked around the store and whether you live in a trailer park\nRight maybe they could determine that I don't know\nThe ... the applications shows the car would first measure a baseline biometric data and then compare it at different points in a shopping visit to the baseline photo and see if you're getting angry maybe getting angry or getting excited the data would then be we laid back to a central server and if indicated the supper was not satisfied\nThe central server would send them alert to a shopping assistant to go and help the customer right because of their stupid mess that say may I help you and they don't or in this case in Miami don't even speak English um they they're gonna be so helpful\nYeah [laughter]\nSo I so let me get I guess if you're then going down there but they still use the big smiley faces for price drops or something to do so if you see a smiley face they want to see a with a biometric card handle\nIf you react to the smiley face yeah and if this maybe if the sale price looks really good and they're going to say well we're doing something good ones do more of that or if you're angry because you're grabbing the car going down the aisle because you can find what you're looking for\nAnd eight five five six six to sixty five thirty three that's eight five five six six to six five three three as an investment the price of gold and silver may fluctuate over time and you could lose money check with financial and legal advisors\n[noise]\nNothing is this constant is changing and that certainly describes the tech world we live in here I didn't do tomorrow we tried to make it easier for you I'm Dave grave line on Chris grapevine that supports them into tomorrow is brought to you by decks calm accurate\nGlucose readings for people with diabetes visit decks com dot com that's D.

platform\nOkay very cool I like the the the bar connection even if you're not a bar person you kinda get the idea of you know a lot of folks just like to stop after work and have\nA refreshing adult
