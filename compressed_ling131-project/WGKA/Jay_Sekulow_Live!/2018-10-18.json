too bad how getting up to the fat\nAnd be ready to fight team for bringing load on your own life from ... ... genome\nLive up from the AM nine twenty the answer studios in ... it's Seventy degrees\n[noise] probably won't come\nBack so you have heard a ... show the Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi Government living in self imposed exile looks like\nWhen he went to the Saudi Arabian constantly in Istanbul, Turkey and we just dealt with turkey on the Bronx in matter so and this is all fresh for us to obtain a document even eat for upcoming wedding he did not leave that conflict\nAnd the reports are that he was killed inside that conflict\nThat's raised a whole host of issues we did have Bruce on Facebook say worry involved with this at all he was a Saudi national not a U.S citizen well let me tell you why because Saudi Arabia is a critical ally of the United states by the way that does not excuses ...\nBut my palm pay the secretary of state has said that they give it a few days for the Saudis to investigate there's going to have to be action taken here on some level or either internally or I'm sure the ... world opinion ears going to be very very bad for the Saudis\nBut let me give you the relationship of the United states with Saudi Arabia we pulled diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia in Nineteen thirty three\nAnd that is when oil exploration began in the kingdom 'em by a and by the way I talk about some of this actually in our book on a a Syria or when we we have the uh unholy alliance but because it's got to Syria\nIran Russia thing and and and some of that's discussed in there about the oil exploration that was going on at the time\nSince and the United states and Saudi Arabia and maintain a baseline of economic and security cooperation\nThat has kept the the relationship pretty strong\nBoth countries have been an ally and opposition to communism in support of stable oil prices and instability in western economies where the Saudis have invested both countries were also allies against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the Nineteen eighties now the Israelis have a a diplomatic up sort relationship with\nThe Saudis which is was it would have been on think about five or ten years ago but they do 'em\nBoth countries have said been allied into variety of issues in the U.S Saudi Arabia were also allies in the explosion of Iraq from Kuwait in Nineteen Ninety One that was the Gulf War than us dependence Saudi Arabia against the threat from Saddam Hussein more recently there's been a robust defense cooperation between\nThe United states and Saudi Arabia including arms sales of Saudi Arabia as the U.S largest foreign military sales customer President Trump authorize a one hundred and ten billion dollar deal in twenty Seventeen I'm so very very significant bear\nThe deal are included sign documents with letters ventures intent but it's not actually a contract at this point so some people have been saying that this was already done it's not the U.S had a long physical presents an advisor military role in Saudi Arabia we train Saudi pilots\nSo you've got all of this cooperation it increase even more so when the ISIS situation came up Saudi Arabia is a tried to balance between his role as the leader of the Arab world and strong ties to the United states that allows us to get answers to what happened here\nSo that's part of what has to happen then what action is taken is a separate issue and you've got to balance the entire geopolitical situation\nAnd balance to the same time this is not easy balance the interest in the region\nBut also you got to get you know the idea that analogy bars would would be complicit in doing something like this has to raise serious serious concerns gave me I Know Senator Graham and others have been very strong on this already and I want to go to our director of governmental affairs or let let's talk about that\nYeah the United States Senate I think probably the most vocal on this has been Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina Jay historically a Senator Graham has really put a lot of value in the alliance with Saudi Arabia for many of the reasons that you just describe but I Would sort of boil it down to three reasons one other one of the key players in limiting the reach of Iran\nOr to Jay they've uh they're going to be a key base for the United states to push back against ISIS and other radical forces that emerged in the region and in three uh you've got to have places in the region where you can provide support for for a allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia is probably\nThe most important player in the region in that regard so that's why historically people like Senator Graham had been\nIn favor of this alliance Jay ... he is very concerned about what just happened a which I'm off the show again he has said that it's the facts bear out in the way that he thinks there are pointing to the United States Senate will act a very strongly including sanctions now again I think if the United States Senate is going to do that Jay they need to do it based on a set of facts\nAnd so I think what you'll hear from Senator Graham today is that he's in favor of secretary palm pay a statement of making sure that the United states draws its own conclusion Jay you can't take the word of the players in this region at face value the United states to look at the facts\nMake its own assessment and come to its own conclusion but it if it's if it's a poor conclusion J I think Lindsey Graham in the United States Senate will be ready to act\nYeah so again let me say this or do we have this statement from Mike Pompeo where he says let's give a couple of days here for them to give us a full report I Want to get that one ready 'cause I think sometimes in these we do have it let's go and listen\nTo old for the Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days\nTo complete that the way to have a couple of understanding of the facts surrounding that which one we can make decisions about how\nThe United states should respond to\nSurrounding this show\nI think that is the right response we've got to get the facts and circumstances let's go ahead and take some phone calls we're taking your calls incumbents won eight hundred sixty four three one one zero let's go to Michael he's calling from Cleveland, Ohio is on line too I might go up in the broadcast Ron\nHow are you doing today sir I just wanted to see in the fall you folks have any information on a ... passed a possible connections with Saudi intelligence and or any other radical groups\nWell you know he's got an interesting past and that he had that showed some sympathies for Osama bin Laden ah in interviews that he had done and by the way this it's an excuse these actions or he also had some ties to the Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd so this is this is not someone that's coming to this without living in that world and when I say that understand the world you're living in in the middle east these kinds of things are unacceptable in our standards unfortunately this is you know the beheadings you saw with ice it this is the mindset of some of these these groups\nBut that does not any change he's moderated his tones over the years he was in exile in the United states and it look you don't want to go to the standards I don't want to say well I just did it so the Saudis did it so that's okay so I don't think that's because we've got one question came in\nFrom Ted on Facebook it says it's not America's bill is to get involved with is putting pressure on Saudi Arabia is wrong in my opinion I disagree\nI think sending Mike Pompeo over as the president did was exactly the right thing diplomatically we need to be addressing this a diplomatic framework and that is what is happening here it's a diplomatic framework that's being implemented because you got to get the facts but you can ignore\nWhat has happened here and I don't think anybody that you're going to hear from our broadcast today is going to say that at all and I think where you can ignore the realities what's taking place\nNo there's competing truce here day I mean number one just pure and unequivocally he should not have been murdered if in fact that what happened this should not have happened at the same time like with so many situations in this region J I mean there's a an extent to which there are no clean hands here I mean some of the association for him in the past have been troubling and you need to look at it so again when you say look at the fast\nOf the day I just want to say something about this uh because Washington Post reporter and so yes that's true ah he's had some some\nYou know I Would call troubling relations in the past none of that justifies the action is looking at a coroner wasn't a decision this wasn't a you know this was apparently we don't have all the facts until we get we don't know but there was more to go ahead\nWell and that's why I started there because I think that's absolutely where you have to start and finish any conversation on this it's a very troubling instant incident and that's why I'm Glad the President Trump and secretary Pompeo had committed to getting to the bottom of it but I think the larger point though is that the facts here don't involved just what happened inside the consulate or the embassy a few days ago they are also\nAh have you have to look back in history you look I have to look at the interplay between the United states and\nSaudi Arabia have to look at the interplay between turkey and Saudi Arabia frankly you gotta look at the interplay between Saudi Arabia and other powers in the region like the Shia Iran so Jay when you're talking about getting the facts the reading you don't have them in a period of twenty four hours is because the fact or not confined to just what happened inside those four walls go rounds of all involved are important\nIt is I mean facts and circumstances matter of days and we got to get a complete knowledge of the fact now again it doesn't justify the actions if they did happen that apparently happened here it would you got turkey involved you've got Saudi Arabia\nBoth allies of the United states and we just had the situation with Brunson released a relationship we are getting better with turkey but as I say that I mean the Turks are concerned that the United states is concerned where all opinion is going to be concern Lindsey Graham is very concerned let me play what he had to say\nI'm In their biggest offender on the floor of the United States Senate this guy wrecking ball\nHe had just gotten murdered in a conflict and turkey into stagnated north I feel he used and abused hours on the floor every time defending Saudi Arabia because there is a good ally there's a difference between the country and an individual thing I NBS thing here is to me toxic he can never be a world leader on the world\nSo that is the crown prince they're talking about there and a Lindsey Graham's it is very concerned we want to get the facts and you can't just rely on the Saudis for those facts either they need to do an investigation but they're going to have to come clean on this I mean something's going to have to transpire here are we're taking your phone calls at one eight hundred sixty four three one one zero\nAre probably the first country to feel that squeeze Israel\nLet's go to take a call here before the end of the first half hour a Joe's calling from Lakeland, Florida only five Hi Joe\nThank you for taking my call I've got three short questions first do we know for a fact that he was required to be at the conflict in order to obtain ...\nIf you get the humidity yeah it'd be easier to get the document he had to be their edited and he went there earlier and they told them to come back on October second\nOkay that sounds like it was pre planned dumber two did he have any reason to be concerned for his safety uh wellbeing while he was\nKnow you would have had ...\nIt's a criticized the Saudi Government extensively in in in articles so I mean yes um I think that yeah that is no question that that was he had reason to be concerned but but he took these acts and he told his fiance to wait for them and call friends if he did not return that's what he told the fiance I\nOkay All right well it pretty well ...\nNow shows on a you know I Want to go back to to to ban on this and then uh and looked at what stay on with us for the second half hour ... ... ... was the beginning he's\nTraveling today but we want to see if we can keep ... a month and that's why I think Congress I understand the concern when we got to be measured in getting to the bottom of all this we've got to get all the\nFacts I mean look look I I think there is inappropriate role for both the executive branch and the legislative branch I think it's probably good at legislative branches gone up so that ... that Saudi Arabia to take this seriously and so that it fully equipped the hand of the president's doing do you deal with Foreign Relations but at the same time the constitution gives the president\nTheir responsibility to balance all of these measures so I actually think it's good right now that you have Lindsey Graham and others in the Congress or just sounding the alarm and how serious this is and then at the end of the day the secretary of state and the president well they have to balance all the things we're talking about income\nTo a conclusion I think it was and I think dispatching Mike Pompeo to meet with them was the uh absolutely appropriate and correct thing to do anything cancelling a secretary ... participation in the uh Saudi Arabia investment for him\nTo some it was the right thing to do as well and I think giving them a few more days to respond is fine but understand or something happened and something bad happened here I'll give me a Fifteen seconds on the importance of the ally here we've got to remember that too [noise]\nYeah they are they are they're the leader of the Gulf states there in the Persian Gulf and standing has the malign influence of Iran and and they're radical Shia Islam is philosophy and we need Saudi Arabia or to to help us with Israel and taking that stance\nI Will be back with more and and just about a minute here at a a feel at one eight hundred sixty four thirty one and if you want to talk to his ACL J died or just more work to be a seal Jay\n\n\nBasketball is almost here here twenty eight Nineteen crossing basketball team or during the ... starters off of last year so things have teamed Fisher and take advantage of multiple take it back and just see the tigers play John coliseum by visiting tigers dot com they have a package includes a special\nPass pamphlet plan will see John how are you from\nWashington DC you live [noise] and now comes to the American Center for law and justice Sekulow\nEverybody wants to the broadcast one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten let me tell you what we're talking about democracy\nShow the Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi Government went into I Lived in Washington see basically self imposed exile\nOr what is it a Saudi Arabia consulate in Istanbul, Turkey to obtain a document you needed for the upcoming marriage\nOr he did not come out he had his fiance wait outside he told his fiance a that and he was very clear on this that uh it wait for them to call friends if he did not return and he did not return so he may have had a a concern the consul was going to be issuing some marriage certificate that he needed\nA to ... marry a Turkish citizen having said all of that here's what we know a week after the disappearance Saudi Arabia said they would allow Turkish investigators to search the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to investigate the disappearance of Mr ...\nHowever the search did not take place until October sixteen\nAnd then we find out that the walls to the buildings on the inside were completely repainted\nSo it looks like something awful has happened which I think there's no question as something awful happen the president spoke with uh the king king Solomon\nOf Saudi Arabia but then dispatch Mike Pompeo here's what Mike Pompeo said once he left meeting with the president this morning\nI told President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days\nTo complete that way to avoid understanding of the facts surrounding that which we can make decisions about how\nThe United states should respond to\nSurrounding shoving\nWe want to get to the bottom of this because an extrajudicial killings and that's what it is is what's called a colonel Smith called it is exactly what looks like took place you're having said that this is very ... I don't want anybody to pick you just say we're cutting off Saudi Arabia and that's it because you're not the way it works\nThis is a very complex geopolitical situation I always say in the middle east you gotta think nine dimensional year\nColonel Smith there are complicating this does not justify what they did and there should be repercussions for that and there will be world repercussions for the beers and it may be that this crown prince has to go is that you cannot be the new leader of the modern Saudi Arabia but I Want to defer to colonel Smith on that you've served in the region\nYeah I think you're right I I think if if it if it is proven that he was involved in this that perhaps he ordered this hit and they asked if him being a legitimate leader Saudi Arabia\nOr that that simply cannot be he does have Thirteen other brother some of which are older than him he was elevated to this position even though he will take off her brother and in some ways he's tried to do some good things\nYou know Saudi Arabia part of the reasons that they have they have a they have such\nA cultural norms and their religious beliefs are so strict and up until recently women to drive women basically have the rights there is because of the concerted\nCan sort of it will hobby a strain of Islam that is there the religious leaders we'll do a lot of political power one of the things is crown prince dead is he stood against their religious leaders he's trying to modernize Saudi Arabia\nWearing them morally and culturally ... board to the twenty first century\nBut if he's involved in this in any sense of legitimacy that he had is absolutely gone and the United states needs to be measured\nVery strong forceful but measured in their response to this uh these allegations prove true and the part of that will be the that the king needs to select another successor could look around\nI mean that's the kind of repercussions that could come into play on this and I when I Want to say are going to the break here is that understand the scope of nature what's going on here nine dimensional thinking multi dimensional thinking here because what you have\nIs an extrajudicial killings were going to call it a took place evidently at the consulate Saudi Arabia and its ... turkey the Turks certainly have the right to investigate a crime that took place in their country but there's more to it than that\nThe Saudis cannot get away with it with impunity that's for sure but we can't be ever rush to judgment on what our reaction will be other than a terrific\nAnd condemn than what actions we take and\nIt may be the removal of this crown prince if he was involved who is the heir apparent to the throne the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that would be a big results [noise]\nAnd I think the world pressures maybe on at this point that's what I think our here's what we're going to do when you take your calls coming up at one eight hundred sixty four three one ... remember we've got a lot of expertise in this area and I've traveled to this ... we have offices in this region I travel all over that region\nAnd colonel Smith I served in that region so we want to give you our analysis on this and I think the president's tone on this right now is correct that big dispatching Mike Pompeo secretary's day was the right thing did we come back and break we'll take your calls one eight hundred sixty four three one zero that's eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten\nTwenty dancer traffic [noise] ... we've still got a couple of happening in rock ... remain blacktop year round one evening wanting you know I'll\nPlay during the old having some made more Irish cried and gasoline I Want to get them to find a point of our big her hand to hand when a county ...
