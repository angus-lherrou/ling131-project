thirty one ten and the phone lines are jamming up our guest I'm happy to say our client a pastor Andrew Brunson who is now back home in the United states was at the oval office with the president sees the I was there as well on Monday and sees me Sunday and took the day off\nI don't see that one Saturday Sunday and Monday kind of took a day to recover and then I did so many interviews this morning we're thrilled that he's with us a pastor before I can say anything to you let me say would Pamela on Facebook says so thankful for your freedom pastor Brunson Andrew welcome to the ...\nThank you very much I Want to I Want to I think for on behalf of our entire audience um let you know and you know this because we talked about this is you literally had the world praying for you\nAnd the folks that are listening does the millions that listeners broadcast every day and we're praying for you without the U.S seizing but can you describe for folks I think this is important for everybody understand you weren't turkey for a long time twenty three years what you were doing in Turkey and and what's your activities were and then we'll we'll we'll bring your current but what were you there as a mission\nCan I can I first say something that we are so grateful to people prayed for us and we are so grateful for a field day ah that such a tremendous job fighting for us\nAnd uh the the uh high all was tireless and advocating for us and you also J uh effort cc I Know she's a ... lawyer but she was also a personally involved calling Nouri and encouraging her and so many ways\nAnd a and you also Jay and we are so grateful that ACL J uh took this on and uh we want everyone to know what a what a tremendous uh uh help this was and and I'm grateful we are too\nWell look we are thrilled that the result was as it was we've got another case right now where do we haven't had that result right now and that is a representing us helping them see a Bebe in our office in Pakistan but uh your case ended successfully but you were there in prison in Turkey in very difficult circumstances but I think is a I'll take a call in a minute here\nBut I I Andrew set for the folks what you were ... how long you been there and what you were doing\nIn Turkey what was your call to go there\nBoth uh we were there for twenty three years before I was arrested and our main goal was to go and preach to the Christ one of the main things we were involved in was church planting we're involved at several church plants\nAnd then in the last couple of years when there was a surge of\nSyrian refugees because of the ISIS attack Syria a number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity not only to show the love of Jesus by helping them a humanitarian aid but\nAlso people who never had access to the gospel most Kurds have never met a Christian or in their lives and in Syria you're kind of fish the gospel it was for it and\nSo we got involved with a Syrian refugees and we're a start at a meeting among them and we're doing evangelists unless that\nSo you were there as basically a missionary I mean we can safely say that now we could not say that while you were there um obviously because of the situation you're wearing but you are they're sharing the gospel that was what your job loss\nWe did it and we did it very openly we we did everything they opened our churches were open to the public the ... um Misha work to Syria's was all done out of the open\nBut before we take the costs pastor Brunson question over those\nTwenty three years any serious issues with the government or local or as a regional government or the national government in Turkey at all\nWell there are cycles sometimes are there more accommodating to churches and to Christians that sometimes there's a bit of a a tightening up\nAh we had a they're often rather than from the government it's from a\nA a there are people who will sometimes there'll be threats bomb threats death threats or we were attacked once at our church with a man came with a shotgun so that's always a possibility is that just does anybody who was involved in church planting a turkey can have those kinds of dangerous but\nIt's not from the government\nSo this was this was in a sense a new effort to arrest you and try and one of the one of the charges was ... so ... nothing like this ever experienced these threats experience we understand that in that part of the world but but what happened to you was something that had not happened over twenty three years\nNo it was an unprecedented thing\nYes so you there's one follow up thing we're doing you know I said you're cases close and that's a great thing because you're home and and and we're going to get into what's what's next for you but see so you got it we still one legal issue where you got to finish up with and that was the un commission on arbitrary detention ... we talked about that yeah they engaged in\nThe working group on arbitrary detention on engaged and pay a ... percent of the whole case he then they're still making their decision and then I have to announce finalize with than what the decision was went to court that he's back\nAn update family with actually that decision and the conviction and and what can release conditions where\nAll right here's what we're going to do there's a lot of you called me I mean our phone lines are literally Jim Facebook comments coming in Eleanor says God is so good so happy to pastor Brunson is free Christine says welcome home pastor Brunson you're truly here due to answered prayer so we give all the praise and Thanksgiving the gun I said that the beginning of the broadcast\nA Andromeda Buchanan I said this and I met her I mean I'm I'm very happy with the legal work that was done by a team that was led by cc I'm thrilled with the work that fan but it didn't and Washington and government affairs shop and Greg ...\nWho runs for office in ... and it just a great job and and the and the circumstances of that I was representing you and then ended up representing the president I mean you none of nobody could have put that all together at the end of the day these though I I Believe that with an ... to take nothing away from any one\nThat uh the lord was in this and that's that's how these things happen and I'm Glad that uh everybody I'm Glad for the tenacious advocacy by our legal team by the president by the secretary of state\nBut we do also have to give credit where credit's also do not just the way we feel as an institution but let me do this we we Andrew we've got a lot of people want to talk to you so you stay on that phone and we're going to start taking calls yes Karen is calling in from New York on line to Karen welcome\nTo Jay Sekulow alive Hi Karen you're on the pastor ...\nThank you for taking my call and I ... and I pray for him to LA and so thankful for prayers to answer\nThat he's home and I wanted to let him know what an inspiration his testimony as a Christian to other Christians throughout the world and on the light that he was in the darkness\nAnd I just thank him for that um he really inspired me as a Christian to um the mold\nAnd preach the gospel time there's that's what we call to do so I Want to thank him and tell him how have the I Am to hand him back in the United states\nWith what you're talking right to um Andrew where where do you what do you say to Karen\nWell are we are very grateful for parents prayers and for a number of people who create for us and we believe a obviously a guy is is that people are but I think that uh what was moving that's what brought our name up to this level or with the president\nA it was was periods of God's people and but I also think\nThat as we look at it we think well we're we're not very significant or importance for our name to rise\nA for so many people to pray for us we think that there was much more that God was doing and I look at it as a almost like we're looking at a puzzle but from the bottom side and someday we will look from the top and all actually see the picture\nAh right now we don't see the full picture but God was doing much more than just using ... to release me from prison a I think there was\nHe was just pouring prayer from God's people into turkey and then to the middle east and that there's going to be a great harvest from this we haven't seen all of what all of the results yet but I think there there was much bigger than us\nI think you're right and again I I think the confluence of events that took place here was was pretty unprecedented I say that\nI mean because when we representing you as I said I didn't want to be written a representing the president of United States and then you had the ability to use this platform to us that we're doing right now we're talking to millions of people and on Facebook compare scoping all these social media platforms\nAnd you're right at the end of the day that uh your your goal was to reclaim the gospel new you you're doing that you've done that and I'm sure you will continue to do that but we have a lot of people don't want to talk to you is we're going to keep going back to these ...\nLet's go to Scott in Colorado on line one Scott welcome to Jay says yo alive you're talking to pastor Brunson he's got\nGuys thank you for taking you to Jay and your team for\nYour your focus on religious freedom not just domestically but also internationally it's a great statement that this is amazing\nI have two two brief questions are first of all pastor Brunson how you treated in the prison because you seem like kinda fairly healthy when you got released I had no idea what to expect since you were there that long\nAnd number two are you going to write a book on your experience has got to be fascinated to to see what this was like from the inside of Turkish prison and were you able to do history in that\nA pass something spiritual onto a spiritual blessing on and so we we ask God to give us at opportunity when we asked the president if we could pray for him he was very receptive\nAnd it was a great privilege for us to do this\nAnd say one more call before the break here Julie California's online six Julie you're on the air with pastor Bronx is Julie\nI'm gay and are going to burn coal because of all that's why I don't remember the fail to pay ... per se clear about what end\nThat's all I care about is set up a whole world and passed to burn per like question can you is that you feel the prayers people around the world ... ... ... and it's harder to lift up her friend Corey\nOK so first I Want to say something about it so they said they they care about the individual and so my wife told me how cc would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us the hearings and then the next day goes through a whole day at work\nAnd just the personal care there was a really phenomenal uh uh the question I just forgot what the question\nWas you know no no the question was did you feel the prayers of God's people\nYou know I I was very encouraged knowing that people were praying for me one of the fear that I had a center rational thing perhaps but when when one is isolated the way I was\nIs it would be for God's and and that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that to her because I I felt very weak\nAnd so uh as I look back uh on my second year of one guard was rebuilding me\nI did it feel God's presence very much but uh I I Know very well that it was a personal God's people that was a there was a grave coming to me that often was not felt right it was like a hit and grace\nAnd I wasn't aware of it at that time but then I Would look back and say well I came through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was great\nYou know you're absolutely right and we're taking a break we'll come back with Andrew I pass arranged runs the moment but interesting statement\nWhen you said where you felt like you were alone and there were those times we we've had other cases during where people say the exactly the same exact was saying that they feel even though it's irrational they have no it's irrational in those situations there can there be completely forgot\nI Will be back with more Andrew Brunson did just a moment\nThe ... one of nature's most one so [noise]\nBut has not ... that's come the sewage tank is feeling all over her camper\nWay way out in the middle of the country [noise]\nWhy there when it gets too while progressive as you want to be covered quoted a progressive dot com for insurance company instantly live from\nWashington DC secular on\n[noise] and now the council for the American Center for law and Justice Samuel oh\nWhat does this certainly a joyous occasion for us with this is not something we get to do often we cases you know it's it's interesting we've\nHandled a number of these over the years uh and with the success in but sometimes it takes I mean this was actually number Andrew dissent felt like a lifetime but in our work is important thing to point out\nWe've had him take four years we got one right now with the C a bb going on six year ah nine nine okay since yet and since the since came down almost a decade so in one sense this was quick although when you're the one in prison it sure doesn't feel quick\nBut Andrew Brunson of course is now home in the United states and a lot of people\nAll want to talk to them before we get more calls and that's what we're going to do we want you to be able to talk to a pastor Brunson um for the next half hour this broadcast as we've done the first half hour but I Want to ask you something here I mean I Know this was on people's minds and that is what's next what what are you thinking next where do you pray and throw\nA ball we want to spend two or three months just seeking the lord and about what he has for us but are we also need to go through some healing process or the lord has already done a lot of healing in our lives especially over the second year but but we still need to\nWork through some things I think [laughter] uh I Want to be a seeking a refreshment and the lord and as presidents\nAnd our hearts Bennett missions for years as I have a mission is calling and it still and missions so in some way or it will continue so we're waiting for God to show us or how and where but that is where heart is\nAndrew let me introduce you to somebody on another person from our Sam prisoner on studios right now in Washington DC who worked on your case tirelessly with members of the United States Congress and that is than Bennet he's our director of governmental players were audience knows him you haven't had a chance\nTo meet him yet he's ... he's met your family over the course of the last couple of years in the representation and what's your reaction when you want to say the Vassar\nWill pass runs in just an honor to be with you and I just wanted to first of all say welcome home I I guess J just just real briefly I uh I Would tell this story to pass the Bronx and yesterday I was on here with Jordan we were talking about pastor Brunson case and I was running late to a meeting when we got off the air when I Walk into the meeting\nWhich was a dozens of of ah senators and congressmen officers were represented there are they actually stop the meeting and the house leadership was on the agenda to talk about their priorities they stopped the meeting\nAnd they said actually we want to yield our time to than from news the other day who just got here because we want to hear about pastor Brunson and how he's doing and how he has returned home so\nA pastor I just wanted to kind of conveyed to you that is Halloween to the United states government is on the legislative level to your case it was inspiring to me that they wanted to hear from you are so badly I knew a lot of them are looking forward to to meeting you and welcome you home and I would just say or an honor to honor to hear from you an honor to speak with you and welcome home\n... thank you and for us this very surreal because uh we are not very important to people and as we we as I said we've been working in a corner of turkey for many years and to see this level of interest or we can say is it is God who did this it isn't just a natural thing\nAnd uh I Believe God did this because of a purpose is far beyond us or that he thinks he plans to accomplish that\nAren't we take another call Barbara in New Jersey on mine three you were talking to a pastor Brunson Hi Barbara\nHi welcome back to the United states I Am so happy you're safe I think praying for you I learned about your story a short time ago because I I learned about his radio station that now the one that had
