{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "On the minister ration of president Iraq Obama and I was there for just under a year when I was recruited back to the city of Atlanta about it the honorable mayor ... St Marie in two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay this is this whole story your whole story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success how how is it you ended up\nWhether you are say or terminate you were fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your firing\nWell a a year prior to my termination I had published a book that I had written on my own time and self publish for Christian men the book was called\nWho told you that you were ... it is the question that got ask Adam in the garden to eat and ... and I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question with Dennis this check a brief birth eleven so\nUh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it overcoming the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before I was just spend it ah but the reason why I was terminated this was cause I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purpose for sex\nAnd marriage and that God created a sex for procreation and and and for the pleasure between a husband and wife and holy matrimony and that in his sex that's out of that a is a thin and ultimately that's what cost me my childhood dream come true fairy tale career\nOK Now let's get this straight you have these opinions which her opinions and literally hundreds of millions of Americans share and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men in the fire department where you\nKnow

the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful\nWhat was the argument for using a passage in your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city's views are and that I can have those used as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city\nOr I had an obligation to check those beliefs that the door is what one council members get\nAnd the mayor clearly supported that fish\nOkay at this point uh this I think most people are listening to us or slapping their forehead and think this is just clearly unjust and when people suffer injustice or discrimination\nOr a really an assault against their religious liberties or freedom of conscience who you're going to call not Ghostbusters you call the alliance defending freedom or David Portman attorney for the IDF\nOh what a da da du what did you do a a ballot achieve conference case\nIt was it was quite remarkable when she first contacted us

law case that you've taken up on behalf achieve [noise]\nSo the the city argued they were trying to be inclusive believe it or not by firing the chief because they didn't agree with his two so I didn't I didn't quite understand that but we filed the lawsuit on behalf of the chief the good news is a is that we argue that the policy they actually required prior permission so they told the chief\nAfterward that oh no you can't write a book on your own time for a Bible study unless you get prior permission from the city and the city allows you to do so we challenge that as being unconstitutional his only prior permission needed is the first amendment and the judge ruled with us\nI'm so that the judge ruled that pay the cheap and now we're going to hit the trial to figure out where the case goes through there and and and how much it damages for the chief\nSo I Try to answer whether\nWe've got a pretty calm evening out there with mostly clear skies and lows in the seventies and things are really going to start to co opt out there looking to friday sunny skies and the poor cat tightening Ninety One when the weather's time can empty on a boat gee now\nLive from the AM nine twenty the answers studios in buck head it's eighty degrees [noise]\n\nOkay\nSo the FBI report has been delivered from the FBI to the White House\nTo the U.S Senate senators are reviewing it right now some already have the word out\nA from both sides is that there is no information to operate any of the allegations gets spread capital what does that mean let me as as of now as of everywhere they distributed so far the publishers not been able to we have not been able to review that yet I'm ... has at least it's being kept a very close to the best\nUh by the U.S that it\nIs that this will now interface three of the attack on bread capital if this doesn't matter we don't like his temperament we don't like the fact that he was tough on us because we made allegations that we now know could not be corroborated by our nation's top law enforcement agency the FBI and a ... and uh and they didn't like how Brett Kavanaugh\nSo when he was being accused of that by those Democratic senators who made this extremely partisan process Beverly Facebook writes this though the other culture a vote or that most has been a\nA file that should happen tomorrow the confirmation votes should happen on Saturday the Beverly and Facebook Rice's we're getting the phone calls ready to go what can the Democrats do now to obstruct or has their game run out there and I think their their games close but I stayed very guarded ... vigilant if your eye Brett Kavanaugh supporter\nBecause I'm no Susan Collins has made what could be interpreted as positive comments after reviewing a report saying you know it seems to be very thorough I'm incomplete that's the opposite of what Democrats what a ... are saying so she's not calling for more investigations I'm Jeff Flake say that there's nothing there\nBut but this war is not yet over we talked about the phase three which is already happening this was still face to the the sexual allegations face three is temperament and they're still focusing on that I think that we'll see that shift happened in the next few hours\nYeah and and look the the the Senate Democrats aren't going to be convinced on this Jordans or they're not going to stop the targeting and they know they know just as well as as as you and I knew that the three Republican senators that they need to convince they need to go to the three there Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski or Jeff Flake and Jordan I don't think it's going to stop all\nThe way through Saturday and here's why I think they will make an argument to those three senators that even if you vote for cloture tomorrow you think there's enough information out there you think there's FBI investigation was Thoreau that's reason enough to stop debate\nBut we want to convince you that this is not the right nominee for the court and I think they will still continue making those arguments to those three senators all the way up until Saturday but Jordan at some point those three senators have to step into the well the Senate\nAnd do the job that their constituents elected them do and by the way the job that the constitution requires them it doesn't require a yes vote or a no vote but it does require that they provide advice and consent so at some point or come Saturday they're going to have to come down and put their money where their mouth as\nAdult he writes on Facebook will McCaskill vote for capital she's in a close race that's right but the real clear politics average has her down a half a poison ivy in a very close race in Missouri [noise] that being said than\nWe don't believe that that like Claire McCaskill would be the vote to\nConfirm Brett Kavanaugh or the vote to get it to ... so the vice president could be the vote for him but we do believe is that if you get flake\nCollege or cow ski that it's very likely that you'll get maybe a job at should at Claire McCaskill because they won't be the deciding vote but it will make their constituents back in a better vote for them to take in red state like West Virginia and Missouri\nAnd politically speaking Jordan and all three of those states I I think the constituents of those states would prefer there senators to vote yes I mean the polling we have out of North Dakota and West Virginia is overwhelming a judge Kavanaugh has a plus thirty favorability there which is almost unheard of you know you've got Joe Manchin probably up by six or eight point you've got Heidi Heitkamp\nWho's races really falling away from her feet in the last poll I saw\nA she was down twelve points are there in North Dakota and she would really like to be a yes vote a Claire McCaskill the same way that the races running towards a Josh Holly there I think she would politically benefit from a yes vote but here's just the reality you set it and I think it's basically an ironclad truth\nNone of them are going to provide the forty ninth or the fiftieth vote for judge Kavanaugh\nAll of them might be willing to provide the fifty first the first fifty second or the fifty third but ultimately Senate Republicans are going to have to deliver fifty votes on judge Kavanaugh if he's going to become justice Kevin Oh\nAll right one hundred sixty four thirty one to the talk to us on the air that one eight hundred six eight for three one zero I the breaking news here is that we are moving very close\nTo actual votes on Brett Kavanaugh votes the better the cloture vote matters than that vote is is let's explain to people get a we will do it throughout the show but a couple of times people understand what's happening\nThis cloture vote that will happen tomorrow or how many votes required to move forward and and what happens in the meantime between the cloture vote and the actual final vote to get Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nSo the only way you can in debate on any measure in the United States Senate or Jordan is either by unanimous consent or by taking a cloture vote which is a vote to agree to end debate now clearly there's not unanimous consent to end debate on this nomination there never would be so leader McConnell had to file a cloture motion last night\nUnder rule twenty two of the Senate there has to be an intervening day which is today before he can take that\nVote on the cloture motion so tomorrow at any point and he is that it will be before one o'clock he will call the roll on that cloture motion so centers will go down to the floor and a yes vote would mean yes we are ready to end debate on this nomination a no vote would be we want to keep debating this nomination so it takes fifty votes\nYou'd have a tie breaker from the vice president so you really only need fifty votes to end debate\nOn that cloture motion if it's approved Jordan it immediately sets the clock to thirty hours you can have thirty hours of\nPost cloture today before you take the final vote so you know hypothetical if that was at noon tomorrow in theory or the Democrats could continue debating it until six pm on Saturday Night or they could use some of that time back but at the bottom line\nA vote tomorrow morning or up to one o'clock on the cloture motion\nWhich will set a thirty our time clock in motion before the final vote\nGood question coming in from Mike in Pennsylvania on lied five talking about the process here we also talked about what do you think is\nComing next I don't think the Democrats are ready to Baghdad yet cruise cruise codes kinda sounded like that that he expects the confirmation by slim majority but I think you'd get they would like you just to put your guard down it was like Brett Kavanaugh seemed to put his car death bike or for Pennsylvania you're on the air [noise]\nHey my [noise] you live oh is it okay great it is too bad that I\nHave to think this way but I Would get your curious if they\nIf they did try to fake it out and act like they were actually we were forced to change their mind is the last man which would give another vote but not the confirmation that legally what could they do that\nYou could absolutely have more votes for cloture the confirmation than I mean uh\nUh it's unusual ah but ah but I I think that would be unusual that so it gets through and enough would drop drop through a but there are there is always with that argument that you should have up or down votes that would be that vote cloture vote to allow the up or down vote\nA but things have changed since we went for sixty votes threshold\nAt at the filibuster to a fifty ... vote threshold\nYeah this is a conversation I've had with a bunch of people today Jordan and typically you're writing cloture vote or the ... the tally on that is going to look very much like the final confirmation that is not necessarily the case on this because I see a Heidi Heitkamp\nWhere Joe Manchin saying look I really wanted a thorough investigation the FBI gave us that so I did think it was time to wrap up debate but ultimately I couldn't just I couldn't get there and I think the same thing is through a truce for someone like Jeff Flake you you might say I got the investigation I wanted so I'm good for\nFor cloture don't assume that means he's good on a final I think both of those hurdles or wants to watch on this one Jordan\nAlright I mean so there you go Mike I mean I think very good question add as Ted said I like the past very possible that this is a one where you could see people voting different ways on the first vote for cultures have don't take things for granted right now\nThe yes this was the best case scenario for Brett Kavanaugh nomination to move forward for him to be confirmed was it the FBI report came back\nAnd there was nothing to corroborate nothing to re suspicious of any of the allegations against him that has occurred the Senate is reviewing it now but all reports for both sides the out indicate that so now you get to the culture motions filed last night\nBut the Democrats would like to tell you he doesn't have a good personality for the Supreme Court I don't like is to prevent I don't like his attitude I like to how he treated us the U.S Senate\nAnd this is someone who\nWe can say with the FBI a supplemental background report in our in our in our back pocket who has been accused of horrendous crimes I mean I think just putting it that way taking up the salacious this of what the crimes are accused of horrendous crimes\nSo what they do that he's a criminal except for K. corroborate that\nSo what's next I don't like his temperament I don't like the way he responded to to me typical us there's they think they could just scream with people all the time through accusations of people all the time but you've got to treat them with kid gloves that's uh that's just not the case there in politics their their politicians\nDon't forget that there Paola ... state wide elected office holders um I I think again one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to if you want to talk to us on the air there is a lot to go through about how how this moves forward\nUm there'll be a lot of debate in America I don't think there's going to be so much for the FBI report honestly I think that it's\nA no cooperation there may be some tidbits here there that are unique but the I don't think there would be those kind of blanket statements coming out of both sides the aisle\nIf there was anything there\nThat is the best case let me repeat that again for bread capital\nThen we're not going to come out say Dr Ford is ally or these other people liars they could have come out as how people who agreed with the story no what did that\nNot a single person no core operation of the serious criminal accusations against Brett Kavanaugh so now the line of attack for Democrats is we don't like the way he acts or we don't like the way he sounds we don't like the way he responded\nThis is again just listen for temperament and temperament and temperament over and over again from the left\nIn these next twenty four hours they're going to have time to take to for the U.S didn't talk they're going to do the cable news interviews are but I think\nWhat is so telling Diane Feinstein said which is that what is a was most interested or is it what was not there that's because there was nothing there to report about\nAnd these are horrendous allegations we come back on her second half hour of the broadcast to take your phone calls a broad enough discussion as well get continue to explain what will happen next which is so important I think people are ready for this would to wrap up [noise] um\nMoving that way in positive direction [noise] one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to the talk to us on the air it's one eight hundred six a four three one zero follow the workday sealed Jay at A. C. L. J. that or there's a lot going on\nOutside of this stuff and they should vote that certainly is going to be the focus of our broadcast from the week we'll be right back on Jason ...\nSouth\n\nOf basketball season is almost here here twenty he likes ... basketball team but there has to start a result of last year so think Haiti Fisher and take advantage of multiple get back and just to see the tigers play little John coliseum by visiting plus all ... dot com bubble packages includes a special low bath towel flat\nPlants will see little John how you live from\nWashington DC secular ...\nOver because I Know what you hope he does what do you believe the well\nI think that's a very close so\nHangs I few undecided Democrats and Republicans\nIf I were to just get today he will be narrowly confirmed\nAnd now your host Jordan's ... I'll say right\nNow that I'm ready for Republicans to start acting tough first day and said they're going to break this shift that may have occurred during this nomination for most Republicans is that uh they're not just going to vote along a\nNominees because they get good ratings the ADA anymore that maybe for once they're going to take on what their voters would like to do advice ... which you can allow for a vote but you don't have to vote yes so I think that that's key to filibuster stopping nominations a\nThree movie four to four vote on the U.S in it but you don't have to be a yes vote\nOn qualifications alone now it should be more based on again but you always see from the left and the Republicans for those porches where yeah I got that they they thought that they had this higher ground but it for what reason\nTo want it for what purpose um uh so that so you should make that statement no more I think that that is out the window but let me tell you this nomination\nThis battle is not done I think this was a significant blow to Democrat opposition against Brett Kavanaugh at a time when they had like a bit of an upswing and there were moments where this nomination was certainly in jeopardy we all do that\nUm this supplemental FBI report which has nothing to corroborate any of the allegations\nIs a worst case scenario for Senate Democrats who\nI'm sure we're hoping there'd be something some piece of information that they could seize on for a sitter say it wasn't enough like they got to go dig and dig more when they can't find anyone to corroborate these allegations so what happens next they don't like his temperament um let me explain how this is important to stay in bed at our director govern affairs than\nThis is now moving forward to actual vote so far second half hour for people just joining us possibly cloture motion gets filed last night FBI report comes to sit at the sorting through the White House all indications nothing there nothing new to report 'em every that we've already heard see that's the same end up being the\n... the motion is filed last night what does that mean when the what is the first uh votes for the folks that are likely to occur\nA rule twenty to the Senate Jordan requires in intervening day after cloture is filed suit was filed last night today is the intervening day and tomorrow they can take that cloture vote which means to end debate on the nomination Jordan I'm increasingly inclined to believe that that cloture motion will pass largely\nBecause look if there was anything new in this FBI report the Democrats that have already looked at it and there have been a number of them or would have come out and then disclose that in fact we've heard exactly the opposite you've been mentioning this but Dianne Feinstein said\nUh she's concerned about what's not in it she was not able to point to anything in it that concerned her so to me I think there is a very good likelihood that that cloture motion tomorrow we'll pass it requires fifty votes\nOr so you need two of the three undecided Republicans are joined if it does pass it means there'll be thirty hours of post cloture debate after that which would push a final compromise\nAnd vote into Saturday and again I don't want people to assume that just is tomorrow's vote passes\nThat Saturday's vote will be easy I think you still have to look at the same three undecided Republicans and asked the question will they vote for final confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh even if they are ready to bring the debate to a close you need a yes vote for him to those three tomorrow on the cloture motion and then Saturday on the final confirmation vote\nI don't usually quote Bob Corker by sea she is right here as a Republican or a retiree from Tennessee no corroboration the FBI was not hindered I really do think that some folks have overplay their hand just a little bit I think he's talking about and his ... Democrats are trying to you know\nMust have an FBI investigation must have an FBI investigation that will tell us everything not enough it nothing there oh no what do we do [noise] I don't like the way he acts I just don't like the way he responded to us I don't like the way he responded to the allegations that accusations that gets to\nThat is what happened extra say the Democrats [noise] I don't think that's a winning strategy I think that this is a that we can get to this war a\nLikely that we will have justice Kavanaugh kind of\nTo where we were for all these allegations came out [noise] um\nAs of this moment but the battle is not over give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to take a lot of phone calls and the second half hour of the broadcast one eight hundred six eight for three one zero be right back on Jay Sekulow\n\nTwenty manager [noise]\nHere are happening on Capitol Hill mailing with ... finding out how to run that are the worst headache that'd be fine in pine Hank now than when\nCan venue to a point that it looks like a lot of the ... pound red around on porn hungry and not getting really not clear Fallon painful bumper to bumper traffic killing ... pound on ...\nAnd then made clear at around ... ... ... things are getting an apple there between having what do you mind boggling\nThat cat will get a check on that for cap and the traffic in the ... thing frightening time thinking\nAbout life insurance [noise] what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens when you called select quote life for example Georgia's forty\nHe was getting sky high quotes from other companies because it takes meds to control his blood pressure but when I shopped around I found him a ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month I'm select what age and dance to you know\nAnd believe me if ... and shopping for your life insurance you're probably paying too much\nMore you're free quote called eight hundred six or seven thirty five fifty one last eight hundred six or seven thirty five fifty one eight hundred six or seven thirty five fifty one or go to select quote dot com since Nineteen eighty five we shop you save\nGet full details on the example policies hotel complex commercials or ... depending on your health issue in company over factors tolerable and also I Try to answer whether\nWe've got a pretty calm evening out there with mostly clear skies can load them properly for things are really gonna affect the co-op out there looking at Fridays sunny skies and the forecast tightening Ninety One when the weather's warm ... gee now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jay Sekulow Live!", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "04"}
