I'll describe it very briefly\nResidents of earthquake and get permission to buy marijuana it's not like how do you how do you do how do you get permission you basically fill out a forum for the government that says I'd like to buy marijuana and they approve your thing and then you go to a pharmacy now this is as a mutt habits that\nThey do like a legalized bribery criminalize now they have a list of everybody who's ...\nThere aren't too and yeah and that's why some liberty minded activists sim would refuse I mean many people in California refuse to get that card because they don't want to be on that list\nRather by on the black market ... be that'd be listed in some government agency okay president Donald Trump announcing another wave of judicial nominees most notably an\nOpenly gay conservative apparently Patrick the boom a day\nAs it turns out the ah both the senior and junior senator from California are bigots or ramp and anti gay bigots ten because they're they're opposing a Mr ... is a nomination and he's also a like a minority I think he's like Filipino or something like that\nYeah it just goes to show you that of course ideology is the most important thing on the court for so many people and the ideology of this man a is conservative or conservative area and right and that's why he's vehemently opposed by the Democrats\nIt's like it's like what they call the national organization organization for women which is really the national organization for liberal women likewise the walk away and the me too movement those only apply to win conservatives are the aggressors or the apparently or potentially guilty party\nOpinion weapons to yield against favorite opponents but I Want to say this there are three I think just judges going on in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals and apparently there had been talk of a deal maybe where\nUm the liberals who would get an up tick and then a couple of picks for and and that is now out by the wayside apparently um the Democrats didn't even attend the most recent Judiciary Committee\nHearings to to to move on judges and Trump is moving ahead or not just with these appeals to read or does have a record pace of very rapid pace yes\nAnd uh of course you didn't you didn't really listen to the explanations of Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris into a gay\nOr a nominee to the to the court because they said they were not consulted prior to their nominations in bus they are opposing themselves you know you've got to read the press releases you know I feel for you\nThink about that just for a second and imagine the hubris involved in other words they said that they haven't even evaluated whether this person is maybe the best person the universe for the job simply because they weren't consulted a they're not going to go ahead um it seems to be fantastic for people who are in an open\nSort of hot talking or any way against the executive branch with them they would ask them to consult\nI think it's clear that at this point it appears clear that the Republicans will likely hold the Senate which means we'll have waves and waves of judicial nominees already\nDonald Trump has done the impossible eastern Mitch McConnell into where hero for Republicans because of the stool wording through of grass simply including in\nA summer session which is rare for the Senate he has to where they threw a really more judicial and point men's than than any president\nOn USA against the movement on the judicial front has dipped well into the libertarian as well as the\nWho who the who the candidates are that we might like to say I'm not for the ideologically pure libertarian but for those sort of politically active libertarian and so uh that's all good news for liberty generally I think\nSo Scott let's move on how about the New York prosecutors suing to stop a misconduct watchdog what is this about\nWell to nobody likes to be looked after to see if they're doing a good job you know or the police always reject the accountability types of commissions and the prosecutors do too and prosecutors have\nAh probably more power than any other official I can think of in terms of the power versus the oversight right and they charge somebody with a serious crime up to and including a capital offense or and prosecutors are are almost never a disciplined for their misconduct and they do engage in\nSimply like all human beings to name gauging misconduct right whether it's through a a carelessness or active malfeasance or malice as malicious Ross are ...\nAnd unfortunately that's a real big void in terms of our system of checks and balances and almost sign this bill this was actually one of those a good piece of legislation I think are\nPut into effect he had a lot of pressure from the left or this is a you know members of campaign\nAnd the you thank you so much for joining us today from this live global Sunday transmission\nThe United nations publicly has control over a hundred and sixty nation's borders treaties that they control immigration and that they control naturalization that they control migrants then they said\nNo no borders exist no one's ... borders but the un has borders around

northern South America and the last ... much and telling the country's along the way if you let them and we will ship the New America and the un pays off all politicians [noise]\nYesterday they smash

fishes America two minutes to midnight\nOf people they are putting women and children\nIs Sunday October twenty first two thousand and Eighteen and the United states is under foreign multinational corporate un attack\nThis twenty first century warfare and President Trump must act\nAnd I can tell you for past it was when the president and sources close to the president that he is preparing to pull us out of the United nations he pulled us out of the treaty last year for over two decades had put you in control over our immigration policy and over quote refugees\nWe see in Europe in Italy and an Australian hungry they are pulling out of the compact all United States because the UN actually goes in\nAnd stabilizes these third world countries than organizers of Margaret waves and has them leap frog up through central and South America into they got on stage at the same thing in the middle east and North Africa in Europe\nIn fact the dictator of turkey has threatened to open up

trying to pour across making it\nAny other children unattended and under Obama they would just give the children over all gross that turned out to be child traffickers but that's a side issue compared to what's behind this the UN the major foundations the Rockefeller supports the Carnegie Soros Foundation is publicly funded all this\n[noise] and the New York times Washington Post last year they said a couple hundred migrants came up to the border and oh the police were made to\nBut now we know it's over ten thousand so over five thousand that made it across into different groups and they're beating up attacking the police and using children as feels something that secretary of state Mike Pompeo expose this organized invasion\nHiding in plain view should be the number one story in the United states but instead it's a side issue in the corporate media\nThe controlled media makes fun of trucks that he's making a big deal about it\nThink about the archetypal image is like a dam opening it's floodgates and flooding the countryside like just to have it here in Austin, Texas last week but instead it's people carrying children that their front as human shields and saying our

these stations and it's helped destabilize them who has been weaponized again to use it against the first world President Trump must act\nWith executive orders put in the military on the border to block this and he signaled that he will but more importantly we can't just pull out of the fraudulent un migration compact given them control over our immigration and who can come into the nation as refugees we've already done that\nPresident Trump as to signal pulling all funding from the United nations and as long as it acts as a criminal organization and a criminal groups\nOrganizing the
