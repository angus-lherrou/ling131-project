you can come help celebrate at the conclusion of this campaign and we promised not to talk about Halloween because it'll be after Halloween\nOkay Michael this is your producer Greg speaking right now I\nHave to ask you two are millions of listeners all across the country because I just caught you talking to your wife Diane off the air trying to convince her that it was okay to give a ... year old Sandy to trick or treaters tonight that isn't in justice [laughter] have you on anything that's going on in this country right now [laughter]\nBut we look\nWe we won't we won't feed a ... well my aunt was Diane was resisting it this was that this is the point she always over by ... buying all this candy yeah good for her that's going to but again how much do you want to give to these little kids you don't want\nThem dead but home to have the reputation of the expired candy you want them you want the king size Reese's peanut butter ups so everybody praises\nOkay well I don't know about the Reese's peanut butter guns do have the advantage of being kosher but an appointed look Barbra Streisand right now is out there trying to blame Trump for making her fat that's what she said okay and I don't want anyone to ah to to blame us for anything like that what he said I\nWell first of all I agree with great that we have to have fresh candy [laughter] so anybody who is considering trick or treating at our house you have not nothing to fear [laughter] as a second we have to have enough candy one of the worst thing is when you get a group at fifty kids can only forty of 'em\nGet ... kids that's not a group that's a gang\nOkay yeah yeah yeah we've had we've had that you've had that\nYeah that that's a ... a mob yeah right what if what if they're\nThey're they're both I by the way I don't I I Do think you know my guess is and I don't know we'll see and we'll get reports from our listeners I don't think they're going to be many political costumes this year the the politics doesn't seem to be a lot of fun right now right\nNow I I agree with you in fact you know that they have reports of the sale for the last ... costumes on as always it's princess and superhero in Star Wars which is a ... not that's not actually on the kids pass it all really which is the number one cost him for adults\nIn fact ten percent of adults are going to go as a witch\nSexy which is that part of the idea\nNo no it doesn't say sexy which I'm going as a witch tonight\n[laughter] and I think it's because\nWhen you buy much I'm so cheap I don't want to actually pay for a class you you just wear something black and get a make a pointy hats so [laughter]\nOkay I Am but no no a Hillary Clinton or Nancy Pelosi [laughter]\nThat would be rude yes let's go to um I'm\nBecky in Phoenix you're on the Michael ... that show with Dr Diane mad that\nI I just wanted to tell you that I actually am enjoying this show I wanted to get back to the trick or treaters when they're over the age of twelve and I would say even up to the Eighteen\nYou know I Would much rather have them come trick or treat at my door then to have them out doing other stuff like I'm getting in trouble because if they're reading at your door they're less likely to be in trouble\nI'm On a number to go ahead\nI I'm not I'm not sure that they kind of kids who get into trouble will say oh yeah let's go trick or treating and instead\nI mean ... ... teenagers are members of gangs or involved in a bad behavior probably not likely to come to your doors trick or treaters\nOh I I I understand that I trust me I I drive a bus a publicly and uh for a public bus driver and I I see all kinds of people [laughter] so um I understand that totally but what I\nBut using those some of those rough people can kind of put that aside for one night have good clean fun on Halloween\nOh I've I've I've got a bucket of candy to pass out 'cause my passengers are probably not year olds candy\n[laughter] no no no it's dollar store candy but no\nThere there you go we're with you on that one Becky I appreciate your call and the other\nThing is is when they dress up as um as you know anything I mean in high school I remember the boys get to dress up as women\nOr girls and we've all grown up to now we're all pretty normal people [laughter]\nSo I don't think it really matter I don't think they I don't think kids really understand the significance dressing up\nAs a here here's here's the point of it to die and if you heard of this I Would imagine there were some people today if a guy dressed up as a girl would that be cultural appropriation from the transgender community\nI'd say you'd have to be that would be a stretch that would be a stretch like everyone it expects but this will be a day that you put on a costume could be somebody that you're not and so everybody who is dressed up as assumed to be a character is the same can be someone who is not down and\nOkay and and I can I can attest that as a a senatorial candidate one said than you are not a which we will be right back with Dr Diane met a few moments more of the great Halloween debate\nMichael ...

I was ... at the opinion last night\nUh I read it and it starts with a with Islamic jurisprudence 'em to justify the holding that she was not guilty and and as Sherry are just said uh the whole aspect of it a false statement accused of similar blast waves equally culpability\nAnd then they then it's more of a what I Would call in English common law approach to the rest of the opinion\nYou're absolutely correct so what we have is a full integration if you will of Islamic law\nAnd English common law so it is clear from Islamic law that blasts ... violates a Islamic law are equally clear false charges of blasphemy are testable under Islamic law\nAnd the facts clearly do not support the charge of blasphemy against to see a baby or quite the contrary it's her coworkers that arguably engaged and blasphemy against her religion\nOr and so I think the Supreme Court of Pakistan got it right and it concurred or in the decision to reverse uh the conviction um and I think this sends a message to every one ... one that is sorely needed\nA false charges of blasphemy or will not be tolerated under Pakistani law and I think that's a help full development for all Christians in last week ... I'm Sorry all Christians in Pakistan going forward yet I'm\nRaises issue out there and we talked about this at the Senate or the the subcommittee on appropriations so let me play first a misstatement I made this is a number six\nCBD is a Christian mother of five she remains on death row for offering water to a Muslim coworker person\nAfter advocating reform the governor of the area was assassinated and killed\nSo this is ... don't forget this port portion that someone was assassinated in killed or because of this scenario I mean people have lost their lives over the\nGovernor was actually helping us yeah baby and he was preparing to petition for clemency for her when he had called the blasphemy laws the black laws and his own security guard shot him Twenty one times over that statement and just because he was supporting us yeah baby\nAnd I also see here you are the number of uh judges in this case including the high court or it would get to the stage and then they would um they would no longer they would start resigning actually some resigned their seats rather than hear this case and be responsible for the outcome\nThat that's correct or if you remember that one of the hearing that the Supreme Court actually was postponed because one of the judges\nExcused himself a bad because he said he was ... involved in a prior case that a lot of ah the the the governor's assassination case even to legally it had no bearing on this case he still had to recuse himself because they don't they don't want to\nTouch it said it took these brave I mean I think it's it's it's fair to say when when you ... you have to be\nReally acknowledged it took very brave the s a judge who's on the high court here after three quarter Pakistan to take the stand a publicly put their ... their names are on it um and so I you really have to be a prayer for not just to see a Bebe and her a safety but the safety of these judges\nBecause they can't trust as we pointed out their own security right in these kinds of situations a volatile very bought this increases makes it a very volatile type of Pakistan at a place that could\nUh uh ... you know the kid like very quickly and it has I think to underscore the violence has broken out was immediate issue here I said\nI'm holding in my hands are documents that we submitted\nTo the United nations or television audience watching it on social media these are documents that we submitted to the United nations uh we've got several of those we sent a letter to the ambassador of the Islamic republic of Iran we testified before\nCapitol Hill on before the Senate so than when I look at the efforts here it literally was a global effort\nTo sustain over almost a decade Jamie five submissions before the United nations in two thousand Eighteen alone or at least can over the last several years in as well as the testimony that you played before the United States Senate but Jay again\nThe theme that you made and then we made in each of those Venus each and every time is really the one that Jordan was just making is that the reason that blasphemy law strike such fear in the hearts of Pakistanis\nIs because often they do stick without facts I mean you heard sharia are going through the fact\nPandering to this case and I'm sure our listeners thought well this is ridiculous there's no way those charges will stick but Jay we have seen this time and time again they'd do stick and that is why the international attention on the case was so critical to the Pakistan\nBut you know what it's even more important for Pakistan so when President Trump and secretary palm pale have gone to them and said look you will start delivering results otherwise you're going to see a drawdown in us aid to Pakistan the difference between that\nAnd previous administrations is when Pakistan didn't meet its obligations the United states did withhold the funding\nYou know the Jerry calling from Rhode Island on line three Jerry welcome to Jay sexual live ... ...\nKnow a great Thanksgiving news or no Bronx and and so on and I think I think Jordan and professor were telling us we need to pray for ongoing not only the flocks to what I mean there were already heard about that\nIf he ever family hopefully but the judges and lawyers involved in here I guess we need to play for their son and the last caller not just the money can prayers involved the Puritans involving they work together carrot and stick\nAbsolutely so is your Harry R let's talk about the judge's this was a bold move for them and a bold move for the government we don't really understand it that way we're going to sprinkle it makes the decision if you don't like it that's the way it is if you like it that's good but we don't have this kind of activity but there's a whole different ... this was a very bold move on their part\nThat that's absolutely correct It's a very bold move I mean the way they have written opinion and especially the concurring\nOpinion I mean they heat the justice ... he he's very very smart and he his opinions are\nUh I mean are they are full of wisdom and on page fifty five he said that it is ironic that in the Arabic language the applicant ... F a parent's name off the uh means sinful\nBut in the circumstances of the present case she appears to be a person in the words of ... a Shakespeare's king king Lear more stand against than sending so so that kind of\nPuts a a stamp so to speak of bold mess of this opinion toward the end I ended up the whole judgment so I think they they just went all out\nThey they they said mob violence is not acceptable false allegations are not acceptable and and uh people who make false allegations are they ... themselves blasted most\nScarier and twenty seconds here to explain to people we have an office in Pakistan\nYes we have an office in Pakistan ... and we have a a a team of attorneys and other staff members who actually work on very similar cases we have\nA couple of bless me cases that were working on currently we have a cases that involve church property being taken by Muslims and murders rape cases so we're doing a lot of work their uh their needs a lot of prayer\nOr will be back with more if you don't get to pull out of the broadcasters going over to Facebook or parents go for a C.

is reversed by the Pakistani Supreme Court\nShe is fried our family most were among the number of her family are already in England I suspect that's where she'll be going as well um this was a major major decision\nBut I wanted to tell you that the American Center for justice was involved in this\nMatter and the first time we raise the issue was in two thousand eleven she was in jail at that point we published our first piece on it and then on October of twenty four feet I Want to play a flashback for you on this very broadcast for most people are even talking about this case here's what we said\nWe've got a troubling development that we wanted to bring to your attention it's got not getting the international news that it deserves and that is the first Christian Woman to be sent to death under Pakistan's blasphemy law had her peel rejected by the high court in Lahore, Pakistan on Thursday of last week\nOr a C a bb is the name she goes by but it's actually a CEO on marine receive the death penalty and twenty ten after she allegedly made a derogatory comment about the prophet Mohammed I'm her first she was first residents summer of two thousand nine to spent five years in prison she is\nUh the mother of five and is now sentenced to death by hanging\n[noise] now we just got word from Theresa May the prime minister of Great Britain here's what she's had to say when she got news of the release\nAnd he's out like a comedy that I hear the the I think will be\n... very well come to have family and all that kind of heightened in Pakistan around the world for having me\nThen I see I get that just underscores the international should all this case for a Pakistani Christian a woman in Pakistan we've never will be no and uh and again and many people who signed the petition who's spoken out at the international levels the pastors representatives will ever be as well\n[noise] this was a fruit picker\nJak said this was not a pastor just without a leader in the Christian Community a shit this is the the way that\nIs an interesting turn of events a lot of with Pakistan and India divided a lot of Christian said this could be better for us living in a majority Muslim countries in the Hindu country with a caste system so they went into to Pakistan and over time the radicalization of Pakistan is law there\nHas turned it to be a very different situation for Christians\nWho they'll share are typically at a treaty to kind of the lowest levels and you saw that in this case still justice for someone\nBecause the world kept fighting for for one of the the weakest\nAh people the least of these if you will a in a sea it'd be someone who would not have the resources would not have the name recognition uh without ... was that it didn't have a whole country was this rise to somewhere else back to her up but had to rely on eternally Pakistan an extra early world pressure ...\nAgain it explained to the people the boulders that took these justices of the Pakistani Supreme Court to come to this decision\nRight of this opinion is just a bold in the sense that the justices own lives were at stake\n... not just the not just the defendant or the Palins here I'll see a bb here but the justice ... decided the case there have been protests going on I have received recently received a call from our team that went to the court they are actually stuck on the highway from Islam about the lower\n... because of the highways shutdown yeah and the entire country the protests are going on\nAnd say when you were working at at the un and I know a great Gore and Chris off in our offices in France this sense was that we were really we know this was a long process but we were clearly building international support so I'm Glad we already have three somebody's comet\n... and I think that sound from Theresa May highlights well we've been saying that really the eight hundred thousand people that signed a petition and the ability then to put international attention on this case I really do believe that that's the only reason to see a bb is outlook\nWe don't always go public with these cases but this is a great reminder of why when we bring these cases to people is because attention on the case is is critically needed and frankly at that point Jay is probably the only thing that's going to generate a positive outcome\nNow very positive two weeks on the international\nReligious liberty front we have a tragedy that we had in the United states\nOr with the killing of a synagogue or we just horrific\nAnd then we've got the release of pass for Andrew Brunson and released oversee a baby or we come back to the break and take your calls one hundred sixty four thirty to nobody gets worked or can be ACL Jay do that at a
