pledge you get rolling what do you think\nI Am ready absolutely my pledge allegiance and to his lack of a United States of America and to the republic for which stands one nation under God and I'd invisible ways to liberty and justice\nFor all fall and we emphasize those two great words ladies and gentlemen under God this great country of ours was founded on Judeo Christian values well Kyle I've got to start out with some news for the Florida and the Gulf Coast area a because right now all residents along the Gulf Coast of Florida\nIncluding the southern part of Georgia need to pay attention to tropical storm Michael which is working its way into the Gulf\nNot very fast moving towards the north that five miles per hour but in general northward motion which some increase in forward speed is expected over the next few days now looking at the weather starting tomorrow the probability of rain on Tuesday will go up to\nSixty percent during the day fifty percent today Columbus Day here in the area sixty percent on Wednesday and then fifty percent again on Thursday as rain is in the forecast everyday question is\nHow much rain are we going to get in Florida\nAnd the tropical force winds the storm currently is sixty miles an hour with higher gosh it will become a hurricane gradually just renting is expected during the next few days Michael will become a category one hurricane either tonight or on Tuesday and uh it should\nGo as high as a category two before it decides wherever it is it's going to come ashore at right now it looks like Tallahassee\nIs where it's headed [noise] that's right and captain Thirteen Khamenei storm of the current twenty Eighteen hurricane season a governor Rick Scott of Florida and has already declared a state of emergency and from twenty six counties yep\nThat's all the Gulf counties from ah let's see about citrus county or all the way around the Gulf up in the panhandle\nExactly rang back we ranked so and oh what a Governor Scott a is talking about he said quote the storm will be life threatening an extremely dangerous\nHe goes on to have the storm hit Panama City he said and they even camp that where you are capping could still have a storm surge so a big the governor of course not wanting to take any chances because of this kind of thing even though we're still tracking the storm to see exactly what it might do a preparation is going to be key\nWell here's the deal any of us who have been through any type of storms at all this time of year or anytime during hurricane season when you get a hurricane out in the Gulf you got to pay attention to what it's doing because they never always go where they say they're going to go\nWell it exactly right and so that's why again being faith is better than being sorry\nAnd when you get the kind of rain and sustained wins even in a category one or two hurricane it can still do a lot of damage and uh we understand too also affecting the campaign we understand Andrew Gillum\nHas returned to Tallahassee a in order to help it for a preparation there and of course Governor Scott who's running for senator right now is obviously and taking the time to do all the things that he needs to do to make sure they want the status of fully prepared\nWell that's true and that's nice of the ... gone back to Tallahassee to worry about the city because he hasn't worry much about them for the past three or four months she hasn't been around much to worry about them\nAll right and this is a mother nature of course in it and even though we're just from thirty days out from the election uh obviously this is going to have a great impact than that and of course kept in the last time a hurricane came through the Tampa area um I remember you wrote that out here ago\nPeople did exactly and the law it could be hurry up and get ready to do it all over again it may be\nYeah well uh let's hope not because right now as it stands we're going to be on the right side of it but we're going to be on the extreme right side of it I'm the only wins that I see that are forecast right now just as high as twenty five miles an hour a with a real chance of rain or not talking about how much rain um yet\nUh but I certainly believe that we could get two to four\nOr more inches of rain in the slower this goes the mortgage to build up the more renting Senate and on and on and on it goes but let's talk now about judge Kavanaugh judge Brett Kavanaugh the newer ... Supreme Court justice of the United states now this is not done much to change anybody's mind if the\nVoting booth according to the latest and get this CBS News you go poll now\nLet me just first said this about CBS News in the ... poll\nAre not even ranked in the top twenty five for accuracy ... number thirty five and there are there probability of accuracy stands at thirty seven percent\nOr more exactly right and I think that both Republicans and Democrats certainly felt um the pressure and the opinion coming from the base\nTheir respective basis um and I think that they knew kept him that this entire issue as it played out with the cabin on hearing from the central going accusations and they knew that that um that are already base where there'll be Democrat or Republican\nOr they may or a black widow term blame the party leadership for however it might have turned out in the respect of fable or not that kind of thing um but I'm Glad you mentioned the idea of people not maybe not changing their mind\nAnd it could be that some people have changed their minds a buck the enthusiasm that's going to be there I think now especially for the Jill pie is going to be something that the Democrats\nShould simply did not a really plan on they they believed the story about the so called blue wave a but I think that now with the kind of thing that we have seen happen from these Democratic senators you may see people either staying home or simply doing the hash tag walk away thing as far as the Democrats are concerned\nWell here's the deal Fox right now just change their headlined just say banking on Kavanaugh the sub headline subtitled says Democrats hope to channel their anger over Supreme Court confirmation of fuel voters in the midterms because um I can tell you that probably both of the political party\nThere are just about is equally motivated at the present time the next question is who's actually going to show up at the polls and\nI Believe the mid term voter turnout is going to be about twenty to thirty percent higher take your pick on the numbers but anyway here comes the music [noise] hold\nAnd we'll be right back when Kyle warned a professor of politics and more and yeah the elections are just about a month away\nEverybody this is the captain Matt Bruce tune into the six am here tonight there'll be talking about tomorrow on this radio station cabins American\nAlways American and always conservative\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and oneself gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to net is air for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings her family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that is significant\nAnd yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share and it's growing like crazy find out how much you could save and why managed here is so popular could've met his share dot\nCom or call aid for for forty three Bible that safe for for forty three Bible met his share dot com or aid for for forty three Bible\nMariel to here in today's world violent crime can victimized anyone at any time\nMhm yeah well very interesting and you know that the ... and with that and I'm One of course in such a sad story um we understand that there's even go fund me pages that have been established at all sure to help with\nSomething this is something that I Would gladly give money to uh for a ... page instead of some of this other ridiculous crap that's out there with these all the help me I'm a such a poor witness oh you gotta you gotta you know again without mentioning games\nOne of the people that participated I'm One of the accusers a that participated in this a debacle um that we can call the inquisition or at the Senate actually is almost a million dollars ...\nTrue today [noise] that's right that's right and you know these are these are gifts or people are giving gifts he'll tackle something that that's right so centrally tax free uh for what we understand but um yeah so I mean now you that's a windfall by anybody's standard standards\nYeah but anyway our thoughts and prayers go out to the people involved in that horrible horrific accident I can only imagine and again I always look at it from the part of a first responder once you you show up at the scene like that and you got so many victims and you can't do anything to save anybody that just that just tears actually for a long long time\nI can imagine them out very very [noise] now um apparently\nThe Mueller investigation and I don't know if you saw this and I hope I'm not hitting your cold turkey but apparently the Mueller investigation is looking into the GOP researcher\nWho secretly raised I'm a hundred thousand dollars to find the Clinton email so I Wonder where he got that money from to go a little search to find them now Mueller wants to know what I'm solve\n[noise] well exactly exactly and you know [noise] you know again but the whole thing with the email it\nEnd this by the way as a Republican opposition researcher there's not a Republican person this is I don't want to clarify that because it didn't sound like the way to begin with the Republican opposition researcher that got a hundred thousand dollars to hunt down emails thought to be stolen from Hillary Clinton's private server\nGrade well again and it will see the thing if it wasn't among the report finally comes out and then to all these threats\nYou know hopefully he will have followed\nThe lead especially would come in to these to these kinds of things\nBecause otherwise um you know have to get at just about everybody else it would say and I think there's three or four people in the continental United States he hasn't investigated yet uh but uh but obviously the American people will want to know how to do this come about\nBy the way it can you stick around for another segment oh certainly okay very good because it's becoming very obvious to me that the Mueller investigation has taken a bit of return and they are now actually investigating things are pertain to what the Democrats have been up to all the time during all of this\nWell right right I think you know we we just spent the last a month or so going over all these things with the cabin I accusations\nThat the American people still want to know why didn't Hillary Clinton get to sort of get away with all this stuff about classified material and keeping your email on a private server et cetera et cetera\nThat seems to be something to be investigated okay hold that thought goes you're coming right back with more of a kind of warning professor of politics and Taylor Swift stuck our nose in a political\nMess yesterday what can we hear you tell her what she did\nEvery Monday This is a
