again Sean\nNow let me tell you something Kyle since last week\nA when you and I got really got into this around Wednesday or Thursday I received thousands of emails from not just Republican listeners not just conservative not just independence but from democratic listeners\nAnd a lot of them are mothers concerned about their sons and what's going to happen\nTo them when they get up in these high school parties if they go to an end to college and all that stuff and I've gotten several letters of course I'm not going to publish any of these emails because I don't just don't do that\nBut they're concerned about the lives of deception with no proof calling a ... a person guilty and making them prove that they're innocent\nAfter you already tried him in the court of public opinion that's just not the way justice in America works\nNo it's not and you know we constantly hear many of the senators saying well this is not a court of law it's not a court of law\nBut we're not talking about even being a quota love the idea of presumption of innocence fairness and due process or the cornerstones\nUh in our society so that we don't have the kinds of things happening that we had seen in other countries are in other cultures and so forth where it does when the day\nThey Kyle you're innocent until you are proven guilty period in the United states of America there is no other way\nOh absolutely that's that's exactly why it's a part of the foundation\nNow let me tell you something here from the comments had been receiving it appears to me that a red wave\nA red wave this coming November the sex and the reason that I'm seeing that is because more and more Democrats are running away from their party and the Democrats I Believe are going to go to go to get their butts said until this time around boom wave on\nThursday even going to be a blue puddle and the progressive left liberal socialist Democrats have way overplayed their hand by trying to falsely charged judge Kavanaugh they have a Walker or sleeping giant in this country the likes of which they have no idea about and I'm telling ya come November the six\nThere are people really go out and vote like they've never voted before and they are mad as hell or they're not going to take it anymore that's what I hear it and I heard it from\nThousands of people that have taken the time to send me emails I Can't even read all the emails\nRight well well that's exactly right because you're\nYou're seeing that obviously the Democrats believe that they're energizing their base but what they're really doing\nIs they're driving them away the driving them away they're energizing the conservative\nOr the Republican base um because they had put on full display just how low they really will and you're right people or you know the hash tag walk away saying well they're doing just that\nThey are the three thousand people are just in the past few days\nAbsolutely and again you know they really thought that they're going to really show something yeah but what they've shown again is that if you're willing to check the very principles of our legal and justice system right out the window in order\nTo get a political gain by the way to Terry\nTerry up a national ... Red Star no I'll call it a red wave out when we were worried about the story of storms usually do damage\nRight well now I could very well could be a red wave\nYeah and and let's talk about something else here too because this is what Chuck Grassley said yesterday Senator Chuck Grassley\nHe wants to answers to Christine Blasey Ford's a ex who came out and said that she helped a friend prepped for a polygraph to make sure she could pass the polygraph\nRemember I read the statement when this all started about the polygraph that if anybody could pass a polygraph it would be a psychologist because they know the way these things work oh sure yeah okay well now we're finding out that that's indeed the case\n[noise] late that's exactly what those ex boyfriend we don't know we have any edits been redacted back that he's talking about the idea that she had someone uh be able to uh what to expect how to how we have and\nSo now I'm going to give some and oh by the way I just said this to you you

through the Carolina a storm we had I mean you can't call anything else they with\nHorrific hurricanes and so I Know more able to um to listen and I've got to go real quick with is\nSometimes I Do a do words from I don't I used a lot of ... values the Bible I use but there is a group called casting crown and the reason I Love their song is one of their um singers with cancer survivor he almost ... you don't even want to hear what he went through\nWith hair but he survive and wrote the song and uh that's why I loved them now this is a huge lead a long haul and I've had to bring it down to
