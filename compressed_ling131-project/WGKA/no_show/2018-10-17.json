{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "Any time help them understand what the Bible says you I mean you just gotta be probably really accomplishing something for the ages yeah you're not supposed to be proud of these things because your microphone and this is my phone on okay guys\nYeah he probably are not supposed to be proud of these things that I I Am I I feel really good about that that I I've gotten the feedback from a lot of people that they these books do help people understand scripture better and make them want to get into scripture better and and as you say that they do they will survive\nOr to some extent I don't have any idea and and again I don't take personal credit for whatever it is and this is a false humility we all know that Christians that this is has to be from the Holy Spirit if it has any lasting value as a positive value then yeah I'm humbled by it I I I Love it it's just an exciting thing as exciting period in my\nPersonal or professional development that's more gratifying than anything I've ever done\nAnd what happens after this book did you say you're going to go into the other uh pistols or in in the scripture\nYes I Would have finished the ... the New Testament after the gospels with this book\nBut space limitations which must be a demonic thing yeah I just I ... the content speak for itself it dictates the amount of space I'm going to cover I don't try to artificially reduce it tried to make it accessible but deep enough\nTo to impart what I Want and it just lend itself to these six books\nA pause missionary pistols once he wrote on his three missionary journey and on his trip to Rome now he's got seven I've got seven officials left to cover on excited to cover those and the rest of the episodes that the other puzzles wrote I don't think I'm going to have the audacity to tackle the book of revelation well maybe we can do that together 'cause we're we're\nWe get we get knocked out on a weekend or no seriously that's a that's a pretty big but well I mean look part of the reason that you didn't want to do it all in one book is because once it goes beyond three hundred pages people get weird yeah and I think that ... probably smartly said hey\nAh please keep it to to the kind of a size of a book where people actually pick it up and buy it and read it and stuff and\nAnd again you're very accessible and so sometimes I sicker book fools people into thinking it's going to be very\nUs scope scholarly a times my bigger books have done that people kind of scared and stuff and the fact that matters no that's uh that's just the parents but um I I just think the idea that you're basically entertaining scripture I've thought of doing the same thing I haven't done it but the reason is that when you get into\nThe Bible and and stuff pops out at you you get so excited you want to tell your friends right yes you find things in east coast this is great yeah I Want to tell the whole world and I want to so I'm I'm kinda glad that you're so excited\nYeah I used to do that in Sunday school but you only read about twenty people and uh what they know you and they know you're not profound so they don't listen anyway\nSo you you taught Sunday school yes ... at your church ... yeah\nRadically like once every two years I'd do it three or two months class or three months ... right yeah well that's interesting does Jimmy Carter still teach Sunday school um I don't know but my daughter doesn't talk about nuclear warfare like his daughter did\nOh I'm Sorry we didn't need to get into the car to talk about nuclear warfare is traumatic to sit here and I know if you're if you're the kid of a president and I know a lot of them are listening right now I careful what you say because just 'cause you're the ... the son or daughter of a of a president as say doesn't mean\nYou need to to tell everybody what you think but that it's a it's a great temptation it is um well let me just to say that um [noise]\nThe idea that you're writing these books again this is what what numbers this but not in the series sort of um\nI think this is the fourth it is the fourth night the book overall and for Christian themed\nOkay so so you wrote a book that talks about your conversion we covered yesterday you wrote a book that talks about how the Old Testament points to the New Testament and the Jesus then then the gospels and now the last when he was the gospels and then this one which is Paul\nAnd the early church and I think so many people um are are so confused about the basics of what happened they need a primer\nOn on it I you know what I Love we were talking about this before the scripture is so fascinating that you find new stuff in it all the time\nAll the time I found the other day uh my pastors preaching a sermon on Luke five where Jesus at the beginning was ... she says you know cast your net out in the boat there and they catches zillion fish and they're all freaked out they don't know how did this happen it's insane\nWell it dawned on me while I'm listening to the sermon\nThat at in John Twenty one at the end of the ministry after he died in ... and and and uh before he a sense he says to them hey cash units and the other side of the boat\nAnd the same thing happens and it's because of that that Peter ... holy cow is Jesus and he died in the water and I thought I'd never made that connection and I went on line nobody else seems have made that connection there's so much stuff in scripture once you look into it we're going to be right back talking to David Limbaugh focus here in Texas show\nI\nAm twenty the answer\nSo fearful I feel like my world is about to come crashing down around the I Can't even get to sleep at night this constant

the job you're doing and I just want to give us special shout out right now to a special group of people are led by George called Ella and that is the bikers for Trump boots on the ground and ... the boots on the ground group\nThey're headed up to bake county Panama City Florida\nTo cook for them\nUp there and they're going to stay till they run out of food or go buy more or whatever but they are going up there to do that and they're on the highway right now so George way to go we're proud of you and proud to call you a friend of the show All right folks Kyle warned a professor of politics or the cello guile\nCaptain how 'bout that is pretty neat isn't it\nThat is that is so great that better or just a great example of people helping other people just out of the goodness of their hearts and that that's really something\nThat that is the Florida spirit in action very cool yeah we've been through this before it's not our first rodeo well let's say the pledge of allegiance and get going you're already a shrimp I ... to the flag of the United states of America and\nChew the republic for which is just and then one nation under God\nIndivisible with liberty and justice for all\nAnd we emphasize those two words ladies and gentlemen under God because this great country of ours was founded on Judeo Christian values and we will not let you forget that well Kyle out it's not easy being Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader he probably has one of the toughest and most under appreciated jobs in Washington DC but\nDoes he ever do the job that well is a question many people ask well let me see\nEighty four justices including two Supreme Court justices passed by his Senate so far this year\nNo absolutely you know I think if you hearken back to some of the early days of the presidential campaign and the presidential primaries\nAnd so forth there was some uh some tension shall we say between some of the Washington establishment on President Trump then candidate Trump and then President Trump\nUm but I think a lot of that has really gone under the bridge at this point we've seen Mitch McConnell a really really I just don't just get down to business with all these different appointments and so forth\nUm and I think this is bound all them together a from a from the president's perspective and the leadership perspective on the Senate um so I think yeah I think he's been doing a great job\nNow over the next month a leader McConnell is going to face another huge challenge challenge mainly a ensuring that the Republicans hang on to the majority in the Senate accident November elections and uh I Hope he handles the task for the same skilled has led him to so many victories before but I'm going to tell you something Kyle and I really firmly believe this\nI hear from people all over the country okay\nAnd I hear from people are frequently a all over the country and various places that are\nProbably a more blues and they are read in some cases people go and we're so glad you're on the air here that we can hear you because we don't get to hear the stuff that you're telling us and I get that\nBut based strictly Kyle on what I continue to see and hear in my travels plus the listeners all across America that contact me\nThe Republicans are going to keep control of both the house and the Senate and I firmly believe that and I also believe Kyle they're going to add two to three seats and the Senate\nMight even at a force now I Believe they're going to lose four to five seats in the house but I think that's going to be about it they're still going to maintain control of both houses of Congress the house and the Senate\nBut it all depends on voter turnout and I'm telling you right now the blue hairs are the senior citizens\nAre are going to show up to vote and the millennials had better get the hell out of bed in the morning and not get soaked up smoked up drunk up and that's probably what's gonna happen to a bunch of them so guess what victory again to the senior citizens and don't forget don't forget Republican show up to vote and\nUh I just want to remind everybody called that the Republicans will be voting on Tuesday November the sex and the Democrats will show up Wednesday November the seventh to cast their vote\n[laughter] well I'm Glad I got to tell you that uh you know there are so many people who have\nI think in many ways you know we've seen this hashtag and walk away campaign yes a lot of people really get a good idea of what the Democrats the the the Democrat leadership and the Democrat elite are really like him and they have they really should have shown their their\nTrue they haven't gone off the deep end\nYeah exactly and so many people are saying themselves for their infant and in other words when you're voting if you vote for the Democrats are naturally voting for something that could be voting for talking points and it might they might talking points but you're not really you're only voting for more chaos more investigation of all that\nStuff and I got to say good morning to Catwoman erode dog there in Memphis tonight headed south ... they're listing tourists are saying hello to your child into all of our other guests and listeners\nAnd of course they are over the road truckers out there\nI Will let you guys know that you're headed down to the radio and guess what it's raining all the way from about San into well actually further up the line where you get to Dallas a Catwoman erode roe Doug you're going to hit rain it's going to be all the way to a radio show if you watched\nThat truck up there in Memphis I guess what you're going to have all that road look back over to get down there to Laredo so they got some rain down there again I Know it just ruined their trip\nWell Ari good to hear from them and do careful out\nThere yeah absolutely and there there's there are the good guys those are the good guys just like a George Cullen his boots on the ground is and you know again I I just feel so good about that because I Know\nThat the human nature of the how good people are when people have problems you know a person was up there as you well know over the weekend and setting up communications equipment because they have no they have done and our governor today told varieties and while we're there cell service they said look\nT Mobile came in here which they did T Mobile came in there where they portable cell tower and headed up there within a day and a half\nBut rising there's still scrambling trying to figure out where they're going to get the equipment from the do the same thing and there's more of a rising customers up there than there is the mobile customers so the problem you have now is on the Fisher mobile customers you can't use the tower\nOh wow I mean this is endless they weren't that out somehow\nYeah exactly well again it's all about pre planting pre pre positioning and being ready when disaster\nLike that I well we're going to take a break and folks certainly come back from the break more with Time Warner professor of politics so so the Kyl warns show and we're going to tell you about what the Democrats don't want you to know when it comes to Obamacare still in the mix and they're going to bring it back if they can Medicare for all\nIs nothing more than Obamacare I'll be right\nYou are listening to the captain's

know if they confiscate pretty much everybody's money they're not going to be able to fund the program administered these kinds of programs\nUh it is fundamentally opposed to the idea in America that you have competition or that you have people trying to give it gives you a better product or better service and the health care companies are very competitive\nUh and they and they have to be but that's what that's what keeps them uh I think moving forward and being very lean and and actually being able to ah to give good service across the ...\nI'd a wide area people there's there's just nothing like our system and destroy it guess what folks there's nowhere to go to find good again\nNo and if they're playing with words they're trying to make people believe something that just isn't true because it just\nIsn't true and it's it's only been a matter of time right now or before the Democrats now needed something more radical to pitch to their base after Obamacare and here it is Medicare for all\nQuality health care is we know will plummet because you're going to get rid of they're going to get rid of and making it illegal for you to have a quality healthcare plan\nIt will all be run by the government private competition will be eliminated all the doctors as we know them now will be working for the government lifesaving innovation would be crippled it'll all be going
