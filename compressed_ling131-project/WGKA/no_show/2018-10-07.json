I. N. O. V. I. T. E.\nInjured and you're listening to do with us on Facebook and Twitter show on TV telling machine\nToday on the TV Time machine we will come to me to an exam they watch the show Mr Cunningham is an EMT working the night shift in the city of Yonkers New York risking his life on a nightly basis in order to help save the lives of his fellow citizens\nOver the next segment your meals on again we don't do serious chronically these men and women make up the EMTs first responders communities in one of the nation\nWhich airs Thursday assistance humongous easily again for those views troubled enough to respond to was in an emergency feel free to do is we trio supposed to go in the prison to meals thank you for coming on the TV joined machines they only\nKnew you were featured in the news too seriously\nWatch nation which ears through says Cindy I'm On any new Jimmy ... much nation is over\nSo my watch nation is pretty much I'm bringing you know overnight\nIn the primary because if you missed a personal than general or we're gonna be just showcasing what we do at night you know ... service in our community and stuff like that so it's going to be a very interesting I'm just\nPretty much the U.S bring into mainstream media what we do on the basis of what we deal with\n[noise] to specifically what are some of the cases that you will be responding to a night watching action\nPretty much everything that happens in a big city you know from shooting stabbing you know a overdoses which has been a big problem ongoing and I'm just living you know a falls everything that you could be up\nTo what is it like working the night watch how different is the city at night and do you prefer working at night\nI Love working and I started out as convenient because of school and everything else uh but then it just became it became a lifestyle I mean I started you know I really liked it and I just stuck with working at a very different from the time I say the calls that we get at night\nAnd the people that we see at night or ... different from the one with the other day thing\nWhen you responding to a medical emergency what is your first priority to the patient when you arrive at the scene will just the first thing that you do\nOn the first thing we do a medical professional other than short personal safety um you know in short personal safety and then you know pretty much the survey the what's going on around the fuse going on for a state with what I was going on as far as the age of ... and the rest of the quarterly\n[noise] now are there certain common emergency calls that you receive the kind of get on a regular basis over and over\nAs far as you know you have your regular leg you're you know your local drunk and stuff like that and you'll have like to\nKnow your overdoses those are more common recently you love your motor vehicle accident you know that's been you know like any city that happens a lot but more so how many like a drug overdoses and you know like over memorial comical\n[laughter] so is there much down time in the kind of job that you do or is it pretty hectic or the ... pretty constant\nIt depends it depends on the night if and when the weather a lot of things come into play and as far down time goes you know we get we get a little you know not here and there and start the night but um it just depends on whether you know on a hot summer night if you're going to be a lot of activity\nAnd you know the weekend with a lot of activity sometimes nonstop you every time it was like pretty chill ... for the call but you know has a lot to do with the weather and with what's going on that or\nDo you get more calls when there was a full moon\n[laughter] believe it or not that has a lot to do with it [laughter] that's home when various places a lot of trust me [laughter] I've seen that I look up and I'm like oh boy [laughter] [laughter]\nSo when you're rushing some someone to the hospital how cooperative or drivers and moving out of your way and how many people truly understand the rules of the road when it comes to you guys\nI don't know you know we're we're not really known for the best drivers\n[laughter] unfortunately but um for the most\nPart it it gets a little bit hectic at times and there's a time when uh they hear like insider than the first thing they all of your mind at all beat them for the corner\n[laughter] we have a driver that try to raise the threat of force but who and then you have time and it's a dangerous situation but then you have times when I'm\nYou know you have you do have those drivers that are will knowledgeable and they know to pull over to the ... you know and just get out the way and then you have the ones that are just like completely clueless and they'll stop them in front of you and that's where our training come into play because you know we do have like learning to drive a training run that we have to go through and a regular basis\nSo when you started as an EMT was there anything about the job that was a surprise to you that you didn't expect\nThat well I Would say one of the things that I realized the everything affects everyone you know what I mean right a cause a lot of times you somebody or things like oh no never that and then you get a caller you'd be like oh no you know so it's like I don't think\nAnyone is is exempted from certain situations so like the thing is likely ability that I have of something happening to me is that they like to have somebody else or the other thing that I mean right so I I came to realize that you know you can't just look at a person to be like okay I could see that happening now because it happened with anyone at any time you\nKnow your profession as you're describing can be very intense but what is the most challenging aspect of what you do\n\nI Would say people not knowing what we really do and department that we really serve\nA lotta time people they don't they don't understand what you're missing the law they don't understand the nature of what we do they just think I owe you call and I'll get the right to the hospital except for but it's a lot more that goes into it a lot that goes into a training and you know whether you're in you're a paramedic you know primary care provided a high level here\nAnd you know pretty much apparently we bring the emergency room for the street and we have a lot of capability that a lot of people don't know that so there's sometimes a little bit of trust issue you know a little bit of conflict with\nThem not you know like are you going to start an easy you know how to be like stuff like that you know ... that's where our expertise coming in and or read the ability is it's the talk of the face of the get them to build trust between any patient and you know a little bar sometimes it might be a five minute ride to the hospital but a lot can happen within that timeframe\nSo I Would say that's one of the biggest thing we have but uh didn't we're not watched they come in and it's really going to change the prospect of a lot of people\nWell of course you have a partner her name is aerial what is it like to have aerial is partner on the night watch\nAn amazing partner I've known her for a while and they were before you have it\nAnd um you know having her as a partner with a real pleasure or we have a lot of fun so it doesn't even feel I worked for the most part you know she knows her rule I Know my role and it's almost like chemistry is was perfect and we just flows so it's it's been a real pleasure to see them often partner\nSo how much camaraderie exists among EMT is what is it like to be part of the community\n[noise] it it's a small community it's big but you know what I mean if the you know everyone knows everyone\nAnd for the most part we look out for each other and you know they're you know their events that we have that will have come together and you know\nShare experience and just you know blow off steam pretty much of a high stress environment that we were there was a constant basis so if you know you know for the most part or our schedules are crazy so you don't ever get the the the the first of all the time you know depending on what they mean working but you know we try\nAnd to me where can people find out more about night watch nation on line\nWell watch nation they visited ... or they could just you know visit my watch nature or you can tune in on um\nThursday at ten the items that will be here every Thursday they tested on a\nRazor meal it's been a tremendous pleasure having you on the TV Time gene feel free to join us again in the future or in the past\nThey have a great Dane thanks for having me [noise]\n\nHave you noticed these days so many people are becoming entrepreneur starting their own freelance business or creating a side business based on something they love to do but here's what they don't love figuring out all the clerical work\nHow they get paid and how to keep track of his own that's why my wife and I love fresh books cloud accounting software\nShe has her own business too and that makes things so much easier\nFirst books unless you send professional invoices except\nVirtually all forms of payments without a traditional merchant account\nTracks in categorizes your expenses and if you freelance like my wife does even track through time and generates invoices based on that was worst festival fresh bonuses so easy to use and we love their customer service to end the tax time well let's just say even our CPA was impressed\nThis is where the issue of free will arise [noise] did I freely choose to home along [noise] or was it genetics and environment [noise]\nFolks if I could have photograph the two people I Am with each day [noise] you you might have crashed your call [noise] living martyr\nHad a smile which happens [noise] sort of buy in your early and ah the the and tripled gee looked up\nWas priceless priceless well congratulations again

Dennis Prager\nHere watching America in a very dark moments\nJust would have been unbelievable unbelievable not because people thought that harming women was good this is nonsense I grew up in that America look at the movies and you see the respect for women that permeated ... ... ... it's\nThe left that the ...\nAre they talking about women as sex objects who who made women sex object in the movies conservative movie makers or left wing movie makers are you joking with me you have to be kidding right\n[laughter] the Harvey Weinstein crowd there there there are they Republican or Democrat\n\n... it's the whole thing's a fraud oh we care about women yeah that's right you care about what your religious Christians and Jews don't care about what you care about women what are you joking they use women the way they use every other group\n[laughter]\nWell we're we're the defenders of blacks against white racism plaques it's okay if we ruined all the cities that were mayors and doesn't matter\n\nWhat matters is we're protecting you against the white man\n\nWomen we haven't done a damn thing for you we passed legislation that makes it sound great but but in in in the inside of the societal women happier today in the new found world the nuclear created world of the left\nThink women are happier today than in my mother's time I'd be very interesting question to ask very interesting I don't have an answer I don't think they are\n\nHey you're the same as men who created the idea of a of coed dorms\nOf throwing boys and girls in the height of their hormones\nIn their early twenties late teens together in bathrooms and showers and storms was that there was that Republicans or Democrats was that a good thing for women when I when I was in ... at Columbia University this was the rule there were women storms and they were men stormed\nThe woman has to come down to the lobby to greet you you couldn't go after eleven PM you have to be backed by a certain time who exactly\nCared about women more the left is no rules no rules oh but we'll have six week every university I have spoken out there's I visit it's six week\nWhat's learned about sex toys what's fun about three Sims what's learned about things I Can't say on on a on the radio in the regular a domain\nAnd then these these floods the frauds of the left left fraud as it were dumping term\nThey they yell at they yell at the you guys who are conservative and religious ... yours yours a dilemma for women not them oh backwards it's backwards\n\nWoman comes a stem that they they released safe thing to ... days before a vote that day he uh he attacked the growth than attacked and attempted rape out on a woman when he was Seventeen in high school and the zero corroboration zero evidence\nAnd and you should read Rachel Mitchell's report the woman who very very very understated Lee\nQuestion but Dr Ford\nBut it doesn't matter to the left oh now he's a serial rapist now he was a he was a serial rapist that's what some of them are calling him this poor man I could I could cry for him\nHe had a right to cry and then he then he gets angry and oh he doesn't have the temperament if he didn't get angry at say bill the man if this were falls or the guy would have got angry right with may have said that\n\nI wanted him to be angry because that is the normal human response\nI've I I've let a good life and you are saying this\n\nSexual McCarthyism that's the term Alan Dershowitz liberal Democrat professor of law at Harvard Bella merit is Hillary Clinton supporter writes in the wall Street Journal this weekend\n\nSexual McCarthyism but he says it's worse than it was in real McCarthyism liberal Democrat\n\nWell I'll tell you the the things that are said I mean I I just if it's astonishing to me\nWell I stand by my original article it should've been ignored then they were the yelled at them you don't care you don't care you don't care and it would have died\n\nBut they okay oh you know they always think this is this is the history of the non left is\nSo you know we'll give in on this issue and then they think it will disappear but the issue isn't the issue the issue was crushing you the leftist issue was crushing you\n\nAnd the president made such a good point Richard Blumenthal for Fifteen Years senator from Connecticut tells people where he served in Vietnam the guy never went to Vietnam and he talks about how important truth is I guess truth is important for the Supreme Court but not for the Senate\n[noise]\nSo what I go up\nBy the way in all in light of my question about has left me the women the happier we have a a video up at ... are you this week on feminism it's a real attack on feminism\nAnd ah the ah the man who\nGives it Andrew clay even ah pulls no punches I mean this guy really believes it has been a disaster for society you may agree or disagree but it is a very provocative piece ... are you\nWhat was the title when he's in it is I mean who needs feminists who needs feminism we'd have to put that in the in the south on the billboard will put it in ... but that's an important titled who meets feminism what's uh\nOh I I mean it's really amazing the left the lush depiction of the left ... sexual ... of movies\nThe left or the left throwing boys and girls together in dorms the right it's a if you understand how backwards it is it's the rights that wanted to protect women because they know real life in real life\nIt is the the\nThere's an understanding of males on the right there's no understanding of males on the left not\n\nMale sexual energy is it is as powerful as as atomic combustion\n\nIt needs to be channel that is what religion is try to do channel male sexual energy into good things it's a very big task my father a deeply religious man would often say why did God make the male sex drive so strong\nWe still would have pro created it for less strong\nPut we come from a tradition that you can argue with God at after all the name Israel and the Bible means argued called struggle with God fight with God whatever you want them to turn a lot of people do know that even a lot of religious people Christian Christians in particular who really do know that are Bible\nForgot that Israel means struggle with God\nYou're allowed to\nMy wife has more questions for God then this woman had for a\nSitting Rachel ritual ad that for Dr Ford\nThey even mock they they're mocking of his statement that his ten year old daughter prayed for\nDoesn't even have enough votes not enough seats to stay in Quebec Parliament

Google or not\nMy name and I see all the letters in the Cleveland Plain dealer written against me [laughter] which I have to assume a ... I think I I have to assume it appeals to the editors there they want people to read their paper so if there are a lot of letters even if they're attacking of ... that means a lot of people are reading it [noise]\nSo anyone with like the Cleveland Plain dealer cause it to probably take some guts to have an actual conservative who even supports the president's\nNew York times has about twenty two

highschool slang college drinking and inside jokes and whether he was just too angry there'd be a Supreme Court judge\nIt's a very good point that's what they're now talking about the latest is he threw ice in a bar and while he was yeah a lot of guy accusation accusation let's say he did it\nSo let's say he did it that's my point about originally\nThis is what you bring up a ... about a human
