Bush could make a distinction between an immigrant and refugee\nThen I think it's well within the capability of Congress and the president to make some distinction today what are you what you said is that\n[noise] well you know part of the whole issue obviously that if people are refugees and and there are legitimate refugees and many different parts of the world that are trying to get away from\nWhatever kind of persecution or other kind of unpleasant nice that they're experiencing and I use that word of course knowing that in many cases people are are are in very very bad straits but they don't necessarily have to travel from Honduras in Guatemala\nAll the way in Mexico in order to get to the United states usually you're trying to get to a friendly country or a country where you could get asylum and be safe and those first countries are going to be Mexico for example\nWhile yeah now let's get into where there's a caravan is right now now or many ... it's estimated\nRight now the ... about five thousand people is that what you're hearing right mhm yeah Hi many of them already jumped the wall whenever on that bridge down there where they overwhelmed the authorities and I've already\nSnuck into Mexico but I'm not a large amount there was probably several hundred I'm going to say correct yes mhm\nBut handled but then somewhere along the way over the weekend they picked up some more people and now they're up to an estimated five thousand people with about five hundred a Mexican police watching to see that a law they they don't do anything other than just march along parallel with the borders\nMexico has already said they're not going to let them in budge they're looking for some weak link as they continue to move west northwest toward a closer to a Texas I might add and closer to the western part of Texas which seems to be\nWhere they're headed a and New Mexico now New Mexico is probably the most burned and probably the easiest accessible to get into the United states is there for a fair assumption\nI think so yeah okay so it looks like as if that maybe where they're headed and in the meantime there are unconfirmed reports\nThat elements of our military at Fort Bragg and\nFort Campbell had been placed on alert not the big guy anywhere and not do we know where they're gone and after we know what they're doing but there are rumors strictly rumors I cannot confirm anything that I've just said I'm just saying what I Am hearing from people that are telling me that are at or near those locations\nSo now we uh we have to get a determination and watch with our GPS and with our satellites and oh by the way did you know that there's actually American news reporters in that chair but I\nDo not know that uh I'm from before that I I'm not surprised because again this is all part of a narrative as well that's going to be spending some way\nDid you know one of them is a CNN reporter no I did not and they are recording from the caravan live no I did not well I'm guessing that kind of strange in a way\nIt is yeah and and as you mentioned you know they're looking to uh\nCome across the border we understand according to some reports captain that they\nAre many have come a 'em over to the Mexico side from Guatemala to a place called ... Chula yeah uh that's along the coastline more or less of a of a of Mexico on the Pacific ocean side and uh so right but they they've got quite a ways to go on again it goes to this idea that\nUm if you're looking to get any kind of asylum or you would go to a nearby country you wouldn't sale across an ocean per se and these kinds of things so that's a very interesting part of it but part of this is of course to create a narrative\nObviously now the unconfirmed reports that we have about military being put on alert\nUm could also be a way of um of demonstrating for example to the Mexican government that\nAh that the President Trump is serious about not having this kind of thing that take place but again it all it all goes in all goes into to the next um but again what what\nSo interesting is that you have a lot of people in this country who somehow believe that there really shouldn't be a border at all and and somehow everyone should just kind of come and go as they please I guess a but it means that we have to subvert the very laws that make our country sovereign\nWell he's serious because he said that they're not coming into this country he said if we have to uh Mexico cannot control this or we will call up our military not the national guard but our military to stop\nThis from happening [noise] west and what he said friday right and that puts it into a very very confrontational position\nSide hold that thought All right so should not be right back more with ... professor of politics were just getting started that's just one of the topics I got an illness

uh the Democrats would be made it and saying our presidents we speak with one voice in our president's going to handle this\nI can you stick around for an extra segment certainly okay good 'cause I'm going to start something now it's going to take a little while to get through but the big issues surrounding the two thousand and Eighteen election right now the first big electoral test for president Donald Trump\nWhich is going to take place on Tuesday no November the six I'm a quick look look at history would indicate that Republicans should lose\nSpeech and both the house and possibly the Senate right\nRight right but just as President Trump's ten year in the oval office has bucked the status quo number one independent and conservatives conservative voters seem to be doing the same and the two thousand Eighteen mid term elections um every time he has a rally somewhere that they they packed\nHouse they do is just like two thousand sixteen all over again\nExactly that's because I think are not just people in Trump's base per se ah because you always hear the liberal media just referring to the base and energize the base\nMore into base pardon it's more than the base of your life\nIt's more than the day for naturally that's because what President Trump is doing is working it's a in terms of the economy in terms of\nA People's confidence and and what's going to happen tomorrow kind of thing\nAnd people realized that things have changed their change for the better um in what the Democrats are offering of course or analysts investigations impeachment with they're not supposed to talk about that often do\nI Am and other American people see this is a a just a a side show they want to be able to have better lives and do better example\nThis election is not simply about Republicans and Democrats it's much bigger than that it's really\nAbout white versus wrong good versus evil it's about free markets versus socialism it's about due process versus mob rule it's about civility worsens violence am I wrong with any of that\nNo you're you're really not because what unfortunately the Democrat elite and the and the party\nAnd decided that they were going to obviously oppose everything about Trump no matter what he could say the sky is blue but that but in doing so by throwing out ideas of a presumption of innocence\nThese kinds of things they have they made it something throughout the highways and bite ways where people are saying\nLook you look you know this is this is going way too far I'm either you're going to put forth ideas about governing or you're just going to continue for gasoline on a fire and and they don't want that anymore\nAnd it's really embarrassing I think for the party it really it really is\nAnd of course as the election day inches closer Democrats have proven time and time again that they're vicious behavior\nIn my opinion should that be rewarded with any type of power of any kind not one single seat to the Democrats get based on their behavior and what we've seen with a everything ranging from judge Kavanaugh and beyond especially\nAll this stuff that went on with the FBI and with a D or Jay I'm and with the uh the

dance sometime this week is things are rough now got a little article here it's called oh so this is boot camp uh-huh that's what it's called\nI let me read this ever since the events of genesis three the chapter that documents the entry of evil into the world is after came in the form of suffer the fallen angel\nAnd as long as they crowds around like a roaring line which is in first Peter he'll wreck havoc among God's people tell our preaches like pollen prison so exile pastors like John a remote island he lets slick right just like ... with diseases\nHe'll car [laughter] an Earth Day but it's tragedies always backfire the imprisoned Paul wrote a pistol\nThe ban is John saw heaven and the cemetery Lazarus became a stage by which the lord preferred one of his greatest miracles intended evil can become ultimate good that's white prayer is so important [noise] All right as I re read that promise it found catchy is if a destined for a bumper sticker\nOn by the way this is out of ... book also to boot camp\nThere is nothing tried about your wheelchair you're empty pantry aching heart these are appealing to the wheel challenges you're facing they're not easy\nBut neither are the random God is not sometimes sovereign he's not oh patiently victorious he does not occupy the throw in one day and vacated the next the lord shall not turned back until he is executing accomplish that box intense he has and Jeremiah thirty this season in which you find yourself\nAnd I said yourself not yourself many of you may puzzle you but it does not be will their God he\nCan and will use it for his purpose case in point Joe's within prison but an earthy viewpoint the Egyptian jail but he was wrong and we put in because the woman Who Lied about him go there was a tragic conclusion of Joseph ... life could have been\nSatan could chalk up a victory for the dark side all plans to use Joe that could have ended with the framing of the jail door the devil had joke that just where he wanted him but you know what so did God\nThey're in prison\nThey Bruce jokes to be placed its neck and an iron collar until the ... time came to fulfill his word\nThe lord test that shows that character in San one hundred and five and we know what happened to Joseph and then he became prince of Egypt took Thirteen Years there what Satan intense for evil guy uses protesting let me repeat that people because you're going to see a lot of this we're\nEntering into some rough times here up what faith and intense for evil God can use protesting just testing\nIn the Bible a test as an external trial that purify and prepares the hard look at it that way I Do I have to just as a fire refined precious metal ... a trial purchase the heart of the same everyday got ... through people\nPain problems with some kind we certainly had our share of\nEvents that I'm not exactly good if we look at them they're they're painful but stop and consider your circumstance [laughter] can you identify the tests that today with maybe a terrible traffic threatening whether all I got that one threatening whether it can join horrible diseases\nIf you see trouble is nothing more than isolated hassles and hurt to grow bitter and anger angry yet if you see your troubles as test used by God for his glory and again I'm saying this because this is what I Believe for his glory and your majority but even the smaller incidence take on significant [noise]\nThink about these words they I read that re read them and I knew there for me too because we we were not where we've only started this thing this this is our
