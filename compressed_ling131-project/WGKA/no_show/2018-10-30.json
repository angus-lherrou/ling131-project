politics\nThat we've got this let's do the pledge and get rolling you ready I sure am I pledge of allegiance to the eye of the United states of America\nAnd to the republic for what you're saying then is one nation under God indivisible we're literally and yes it is for all\nWe emphasize that your words ladies and gentlemen under God our great country was founded on Judeo Christian values and we talked about that last night so if you want to hear what what we were ... referring to go to the pod cast for yesterday's show which is over on my website the captain's Americans there and watch dark out well our ...\nFirst of all the\nLooting suspects and we still have to call them that you know you're guilty to your proven innocent ah was wield in a wheelchair into court yesterday and ah a rain tell us about that\nThat's correct cap on the forty six year old of course uh you like they don't fight on a truck driver of some sort of\nSummer the road the independent driver\nOr trade overrode independent driver [noise]\nUm he had sustained injuries of course with the gun battle that he had with uh the police for state descended on the synagogue to stop them\nUh and uh so yes he brought it to court he was brought in in a wheelchair and I understand captain that the ah the the officers there actually even a shackled him to the wheelchair itself\nA deli because of the injuries he's had\nBut he was asked by the judge if he understood the charges that were read out against him\nUm and then a somewhat what's being reported as a soft voice you said yes I'm only understand of course is being held without any kind of bail and we don't know that he's actually under the clean at this point [noise]\nUm but it's interesting to point out too that uh you know to have someone read these charges these of of murder or that day and the person says yes I understand um it's harder to make the case that someone is just to cook\nA you know he obviously understood evidently what he was doing\nAnd this is the very face of evil that we see the things that not only he said on social media but the things kept him that he said even to the police officers according to reports\nAfter he was a after he was stopped saying that he wanted to kill all the Jews are this is a terrible terrible evil thing and it's it's a it is that people in Pittsburgh where there of course just still reeling from the well\nI Believe the president and his wife Maloney a today are going to Pittsburgh I Believe they're headed there today is that correct\nYes he is that there was a a from a a common thing I think from the city's mayor there or not wanting to be some kind of the security issue coming up\nUh about of course the president is going to be going there to comfort those and meet with some of the officers as well and we understand captain that the rabbi there a rabbi or a Jeffrey Myers\nAre there at the tree of life synagogue a said earlier today on the news on the news coverage that he would welcome President Trump to come he said that he was a citizen that's as president and you're certainly welcome to come\nAnd there were some other rabbis belonged to some sort of progressive and that was the name of it progressive rabbi group and they said they did not want him there they thought that uh uh he was not the right person or some kind of crappy comments which all they had to say when they said we're progressive I knew all I needed to know\nWell there was another quote that I saw from one to an individual\n'cause this is ridiculous you're talking to president of the United states\nWell it exactly right and this of all times kept it now is the time where we we don't think about politics personally I Would come together as Americans they\nExactly so whether the whoever the president is there are coming there and their capacity and this is one hopes to bring actually bring our nation's together\nAnd when you see the politics on full display by some who want to uh come into this kind of situation and create that kind of political division it's ... it's a critically distasteful we're trying to\nA ... number one comfort but people who have had this horrible tragedy uh inflicted upon them\nAnd of course also that they might bury the dead and that there'll be some kind of a healing that can start\nAt this ... this is why we come together like this and one person said well his his rhetoric President Trump's rhetoric about immigrants caused somehow you know was a causal factor in this happening\nUm all of these things of course are swirling around with the political discussion of it um but uh nobody is responsible for this shooting other than the shooter no ... you know this person had the evil hatred in his heart\nRight and everybody needs to take it a little good long look at themselves Democrat Republican independent whatever you might happen to be and just sit there and think for a second because you all had a part in this all of you and\nWhen they want to claim to president for his rhetoric well he's not the one that started it it started when he got elected to be the president and it hasn't stopped since [noise] and that's all I'm going to say about that because I Want to move on to something else I got to see something now you and I are going to talk about a very\nVery positive story that's come out of hurricane Michael are in that the ah Panama City manager\nPanama City Florida seems to be a gift from God that was just dry right in the lap of these people because they've got a brand new retired army major general mark McQueen who no sooner retired from the army having served in Iraq and Afghanistan started his job as city manager and Florida\nAnd I'm a city when it was slammed by a category for hurricane and now he gets to be the one in charge of rebuilding the city and you couldn't have asked for a better leader\nThat you're absolutely right that they kept the major general Mike the queen of course retired fifty eight years old actually spent the night a re understanding the police station\nLast it's rough that last it's rough uh as far as the hurricane had there was bearing down on the Florida Panhandle uh and before that he was\nHelping to coordinate relief efforts for Florence a but yes he says the right man for the for the job and and uh I hear the music so I think we'll talk more about\nAnd we will we well and so she'll be right back with more than ... what do we tell you about major general mark McQueen and the job then he's taken on now is the city manager and Panama City this is I really feel good story I'll be right back\nEverybody this is the cabinet members into the six am here tonight that they'll be talking about tomorrow on this radio station the cast is America was\nLet's talk about your business find [noise] think about other things you're doing to the times\nThe mass town between networking events and ... says you're probably spending plenty of

is free and I think he they guarantee that you don't mind they will pick it up for free [noise]\nAnd um the checkpoints are going to be fortified to the point to where if there is\nTerrorists and the Mets they want to try to do something is going to be very difficult for them to do anything\nWell you know kept in one of the primary functions of the presidency is to protect the borders of the United states of America that you know only when the charge of of the president and and so obviously is taking a these measures some people will say this is a military operation of the border it's not it's not\nIt's out and you have to understand for the people that do that there are more odd because again we can't put armed troops combat troops on our border because of the ... we can't do it now\nAnd the states do it with the national guard sure can we assist the federal agencies down there with military police sure can they assist in the border patrol functions down there\nAbsolutely and that's what they're going to do this is all part of what they can do and the president again yesterday warned the invasion as he called it of of migrants a which is what they knew that the newspapers calling it you know the media is calling these people migrants they're not migrants are illegals\nAnd he's warning them that our military is waiting for you\nBut we'll see what happens and he also said yesterday that the group includes gang members and some very bad people\nExactly right and he was I think also President Trump is doing is obviously\nNot only trying to do everything possible within the law to protect the border but he's also meeting to send that message to the undoing government or the Guatemalan government to the Salvadoran government and to Mexico as well that the United states takes this very seriously you can't simply have\nA band of thousands of people trying to walk a thousand miles in order to get to the to the United states to uh to call for asylum a there are and of course people can call for asylum for numerous different we've like\nEnjoy right where they're at in Mexico\nWell exactly because they've already reached a friendly country a country that is going to be able to process their claim\nUm and so again it it sort of goes against is not exactly against international law but the custom of international law that you would request asylum in the first friendly country you get you\nRight now we should point out that the\nPresident is going to be in by the way we're coming up on a break here can you stick around for another segment certainly yeah All right but I'm going to tease what we're going to do next um we're going to have a bunch of rallies the president's coming to Florida at least twice more between now and election day I've got his schedule where he's going to be what he's doing they added a whole bunch of events yesterday\nAnd you're talking about a whirlwind tour he's going to be honest there's going to be on it

we get for for for goodness sake at least vote ... that's the one thing you can do\nIt right to do it and you need to do it unless I Want to say something about borders\nWhy is it important to have borders what if you read the Bible it was extremely important to have borders um in fact there was a covenant guy gave his people\nAnd let me give it to you because we are God's people nation under God\nIf it's for a nation that suffers wrongfully God shall deal with this and violence should be no more or destruction with in your barter exact words from the Bible and reading for the people Shelby righteous and bless this is my covenant with you\nSo we cannot have a lot of you know I've always said that I even on the show I Believe that said I worry more I've always worried more about the enemy within Saudi king David he didn't mind battling it though is the the giant that shouldn't have come into they can but he said one of my own people come and get that that\nThat's a little different took down a little hard uh we have to have borders\nAnd so thank God for president that's doing everything he can and and the cat to try to explain to how we're doing that and please listen to him because a lot of you don't have it quite right and I didn't either I didn't notice that a certain things we can do and by the way ... while I'm getting into law enforcement here 'cause he's

anyway um we do have to worry about that and that's why it's it's important and I'm Glad that we have a president that gets it we have got to be competent keepers and we got to have those borders\nUm
