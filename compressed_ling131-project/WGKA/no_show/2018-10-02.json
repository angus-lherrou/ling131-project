liberty and justice for all\nWe emphasize the two words ladies and gentleman under God district country arrives was founded on Judeo Christian values\nWell Kyle plenty to talk about tonight first of all I'm Senator Mitch McConnell came out in no uncertain terms yesterday and said that there will be a vote this week on judge Brett Kavanaugh\nDirectly right kept going and and certainly\nYou know this whole idea of the week pause and vote for just did a by Senator Flake of course and then of course it was supported by other senators causing the president to\nCall for the FBI investigation that would last about a week and we understand as well that the interviews could or could be wrapping up very quickly and the middle of this and in the middle of this week basically\nSaying you know why does your wife that because no one stories have changed\nWell exactly they can talk to all the different pillars involved and and submit their report um about of course what is happening now is now you're hearing the Democrats wanting to have a a investigation go in to judge Kavanaugh as to whether or not have perjured himself\nWhile talking to the ... the to the Senate committee and so again another delay tactic so what Mitch McConnell has to do is you've got to keep this thing on track\n'em but mark my words as we get towards friday\nA and a possible vote or what it looks like we'll be vote if Mitch McConnell is is able to make this happen um you'll hear more and more outcry we haven't had enough time there are other people that came up in these conversations we have to talk to them what about another and and\nThe father was one yesterday another one that surfaced oh yeah but that got shut down very quickly\nWell of course of course but the desperation time and the only thing that the Democrats can do the last thing and they play book here after they've literally destroyed judge cabin on his family is now to simply move the goalposts\nAnd last night the boyfriend for seven years of miss sweat Nick that's ... a client came out and talked about her and we found out some things about her she actually threatened to kill his unborn child amongst other things\nWere very uh very concerning and and to talk about things of this nature is certainly very very terrifying\nAnd we should be very concerned um and of course taking all in total in the new atmosphere that the Democrats have created they are creating this atmosphere\nBy which anybody can accuse anybody of anything and everything has to be taken seriously as if it were the gospel truth\nUp so based on that obviously I'm sure we have an FBI investigation into this now I mean it's I'm not trying to be flip this very very serious stuff\nThe way that the Democrats have now decided that this is the way we're going to do business in our country I guess\nBut even so you take that with the idea that there was another evidently I'm a lawsuit filed against a I'm a against her by her former employer which ... calls bogus\nBut nevertheless ah there's some there's some very interesting things I'm In this woman's a recent past year that that could shed some light on the kinds of accusations that she was getting against Kavanaugh or are they really real\nYeah that's all true and of course the other thing is folks I Am talking to warn other professor of politics because he is and by the way of this a session of the captains America College of common sense is in session [laughter]\nWe we point out one last night where we're going to ride with that one for a while we're\nGoing to have too much from that now before way before I go any further I Want to say something a lot of people saw me post something on Facebook yesterday and you're aware of this joke Kyle I was approached by um MSNBC and the or TDY tour a show called MSNBC Live\nA two PM live afternoon show there apparently coming down here to Florida to the University of Tampa campus where they're going to broadcast on friday October the twelve\nUp from two to three PM and they want me to appear on a panel that they have now the only problem with that\nIs uh they've been known to out number the conservatives or the patriots by four or five to one and just have a good old time you know going back and forth and\nI've asked the listeners what they think about whether or not they think I should do this or not based on what they know about it and you get a little research and found out something about this Katie chore you want to tell the listeners about that\nJust came across a little bit of her program in the past and\nI'm a good article on the hill Katy told the fans quote a few place a few misplaced words unquote by Blumenthal about Vietnam service\nWhoa yeah a few misplaced words yeah well that's what I was an outright lie\nYeah and that senators so words I Believe that and that they had a misplaced words or she was saying that are here to take and full responsibility or something like that but um but yeah the whole\nYeah because he said he went over and he went over and served in country right when the Marines and he was in the reserves and never left the United states\nWell you know and and generally speaking I I think that when you when you really tell a whopper like that I mean that that seems to be pretty significant and and the reason I say that\nAnd of course kept in a lot of your listeners know you're too kind a combat wounded Vietnam veteran yeah and uh you know to to say that oh well I served in Vietnam to yadda yadda yadda absolutely is dishonorable to say\nIt's held stolen valor yeah because the people that actually served and got a injured or killed it just literally designers their service or this designers them or to try to glom on to what they did\nA terrible I Will hold that thought folks will be right back with more of a cow and a professor of politics and uh yeah I'm I'm the jury's out on this I'm waiting to see what else they have to say\nBecause they have to get
