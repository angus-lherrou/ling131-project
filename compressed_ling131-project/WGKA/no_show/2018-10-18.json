{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "So you might have only three thousand children in a particular area who are allowed to use vouchers they limit them in terms of funds and that's not at all the same thing as a wide open voucher program that acknowledges that the parents as taxpayers\nAre have already put in the money to educate their children and so they ought to be able to take\nThat money or at least a portion of it even given how much states are spending per child sometimes ten Fifteen thousand dollars per child even if you gave parents half of that\nAnd allow them to use it to you is tutor supplemental services to afford a private school to home school whatever it might be parents are going to make a far better decision and they'll get the education they want but but we have a lot of um [noise]\nI hate to say this but kinda cowardly legislators who are cowed by the education unions and buy all the advocacy unions who say you can't disrupt the public schools and my question to them is\nIt are the public schools doing what we want them to do they're they're turning out kids who are politically left who have no faith who are gender confused\nWhere activists in in the you know sort of left wing sense is that really where most legislators have you put it like that is that really where they think the tax parents want their money to go we need to create alternative\nWell it really is a it is shocking that legislators I mean I tend not to think of politicians is being courageous people um but in this case it\nIs up to the people which is to say the voters to make them understand you must do this we demand that you do this or this is why we elected you\nWrite and there's a lot of um [noise] uh how how should I put it up his home here when it comes to the dialogue surrounding this you can't mentioned vouchers so that people complaining that you're trying to defund the public schools\nBut actually if you look at um the proposals that are out there they always preserve the operating costs for the school and then they they take the money that the instructional cost per student\nIn the end of the public schools are not they find that they really don't lose they don't have the same amount of money they will need to educate those children\nRight any amount of money that's given to the parents certainly not a huge chunk that is normally allocated per student because every single proposal reserve the operating costs and so\nThat that's one of one of the problems here is that the the teachers union has gotten out ahead of the game in terms of thinning this radical proposal to keep on the public schools and then\nSenate as a matter of injustice to children in poor neighborhoods and and the reality of it is Eric that the parents in poor neighborhoods that and you look at parenting idiots Philadelphia they overwhelmingly support ... their kids are trapped in school and they don't like to\nLook at the let's face it the department of education\nA and the American public schools are part of what I now think of as the swamp they are no longer doing anything except serving their own interests they don't care about the kids they always pretend to\nBut unfortunately they don't demonstrably they don't end by the way it's not even a for them to decide whether they care it's up to the parents to decide whether they're doing what the parents want them to do and the idea that we pushed away from this\nAh really is horrifying as I said it's fundamentally an American it certainly goes against safe or which is what makes it on American ... in America we are supposed to have the freedom or to educate our kids as we see fit\nAnd the public schools are saying no you don't and you think where did they get the right to do that I don't know what happened but we need to undo it quickly\nRight and one of the things parents to relate to in this again why it's not possible to change the situation before it's too late for your child is it not only do you have the ads that advocacy organizations from the outside pressuring in the age\nYou have all the professional education associations national school boards association National Association school counters elementary school\nAll of these are have adopted the progressive mindset\nAnd they're pushing an agenda and so all of that weighs heavily on school boards and on on even the local um educators when they're trying to figure out which direction they're going to go in so it's it's really not possible for a good teacher to to push back against the\nThe Saddam me of pressure that's coming their way\nAnd and it's just a it's a much more difficult situation than parents might realize that's why we encourage them to really you know we did what we've collected in this book and just confront the reality and then ... true what do I do for my child\nThis is a very very important folks the book is get out now we will be right back to

don't forget to check out the captain's America third watch dot com nesting captains America third watch dot com well joining us tonight doing your job because he's the man of the hour this week is Kyle worn a professor politics Wayne or\nA says he's exhausted and he's lost his voice\nThey you know he's been on radio every day of the week plus he was on TV Sunday for an hour or do you know that\nI did not know that yeah he was doing some new sports handicap show which CBS he was like do you mean the Greek on the Sunday NFL football program oh wow yeah so there you go but anyway and ah so you're you're a man and up to to to do a whole week so you got six days this week but let's say the pledge and keep going you reading\nI sure am I going to lead to a gym to to the flag all the United states of America and to the republic for what you're saying one nation under God indivisible where liberty and justice\nFor all of them and we emphasize those two words ladies and gentleman under God\nBecause our great country was founded on Judeo Christian values well Kyle\nThere's all kinds of stories that came out yesterday\nThe one that caught my I'll get to in a minute but yesterday we had one of those almost situations were the first lady Melania Trump was on a flight to New Jersey or from the nation's capital and the plane she was flying and had to turn around and go back because there was smoking a cabin and apparently\nThey gave the members on the aircraft her staff and the reporters around there what caused to put over their face so that they could breed without having any problems with the smoke there was in the cabin\n[noise] yeah I heard about that and uh certainly uh we're glad that there was no other kind of emphasis on a doctor but\nI had to be a very scary time and they certainly made the right decision to turn around and come back certainly the of smoke in the cabin that that's a huge deal and you have to take care of it immediately by getting back on the ground\nYou bet it is and of course we're glad to hear that nothing happened as a result of that now we are going to get into some of the major stories of the world because we still got to a situation where the New York times is reporting that the United states has evidence of the crown prince is the Saudi crown princes involving\nAnd that reporter ... death\nIs very true and the ... of course very troubling the the whole situation obviously and this this is a terrible terrible story of someone who obviously I'm you know did not see this coming this was a a a murder 'em straight up murder of of a journalist\nAnd so and the evidence is being put together the president of course has said they're looking at it very closely the Turks\nAlso of course investigating a one particular item captain that I came across was that when the Turkish investigators\nWent into the Saudi conflict ah they found that evidently a lot of it had been freshly painted on the inside\nSo obviously there's some red flags go on up here\nAnd and the crown prince who really seems to be the one wielding the power in the kingdom the king Solomon uh we understand is ailing really the crown prince is the one who has been going around a ... century representing the kingdom\nIt's hard to believe to me and again we're still in the midst of this investigation but it's hard to make it hard for me to believe\nThat that something like this of this magnitude could happen without without the crown prince or people uh close to him that the government of Saudi Arabia not knowing about it\nBasically well we'll find out a shortly and something else he caught my eye yesterday to talk about tonight that actually was a refined a little bit last night\nAs the discussion about the family illegal immigrant surge now coming into this country which is at record levels for example we happen to know\nWe have a large group of illegals that are headed our way it's a caravan\nThey're calling it that's coming out of Central America it's reported to be about two thousand Central American migrants making its way of towards the southern border of the United states now the caravan is predominantly made up of Honduran natives are they began their march last friday they now reached Guatemala\nThey're picking up more migrants on their journey to come along the way and\nThe trip north does not mark any type of unusual event because ah tens of thousands of Central Americans have migrated to the U.S uh in the past to flee violence and poverty in central and South America\n[noise] exactly and we understand that that number is growing and if I'm In the current care of and we also understand that the Mexican government has now sent some five hundred additional a ... federal police or to the border with Guatemala\nAnd and so this is going to play out over a period of time of course but you're right that you have a lot of people trying to flee a genuine political persecution genuine violence and this is one of the things I Know that a vice president Mike Pence has been involved with\nA talking to the leaders of I Believe Honduras El Salvador and also Guatemala and trying to um ... the idea of course that they need to do more to stop illegal immigration\nOr from their country to the United states and the United states in some ways can can reach out to help them uh with uh with some of the conditions that exist and those are in that part of the world in the end those countries so it's a very complex issue but certainly the caravan and the world's going to continue to\nDraw here is what Mexico is saying Mexico immigration officials warned that people traveling unauthorized in a caravan meaning they didn't get visas from the consulate in on doors will not be allowed to enter Mexico however in the past\nThey've altered that message because they've offered migrants human chair a humanitarian visas as well as age so we don't really know what they're going to do\nWhat we don't um but we do know that from that is that a specially in Mexico they the Mexican government frown or shall we say on illegal immigration on migration through the country\nUm and they have some very very strict law they don't see any problem and enforcing immigration law evidently\nAh that seems to be a real problem for many of the far left in this country who don't think that we should have immigration enforcement whatsoever\nWhile they're being held by members of the progressive left Democrats their immigration groups that are being funded by\nWell since dire and Hollywood lead us are actually helping them and uh they're they're keeping them which supplies and food and this that and the other so they can continue their track along the way and pay the bribes they\nNeed to make some kind of rituals to get 'em up closer to the United states All right hold that thought books will be right back one more with Kyle warning professor of politics and the captain's America third\nTuned into the six AM and then I was\nStation is America\nThese American conservative\nThe ... one of nature's most ... [noise]\nThat is not a bone that's Kim ... all over her camper\nWay way out in the middle of the country\nWhy they're there when it gets too wild progress because we want to be covered today a progressive dot com progressive insurance company in\nThat mood here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now\nNot into relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain quite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains new to aging exercise\nAnd everyday living let me ask you to our aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks or playing golf for tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor maybe all you need to lower or even eliminate these pain\nWhole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something\nAnd I'm Twenty one months into his presidency\nRegulatory reform now has saved American families and businesses are reportedly thirty three billion dollars according to the Trump Administration now compare that\nTo the Obama record were in their first twenty months in office President Obama imposed two hundred and forty five dollars or inside Jordan forty five billion dollars and regulatory costs on American people\nYou know this is a big contrast hey I I don't think that we can emphasize this enough under the philosophy say for example of President Trump or the conservatives um versus a block away\nI'm a and the liberals or the left is\nThe idea is to release the American people to do what they do best and that is to create and to innovate and to push industries forward and so on and so forth\nBut if you try to regulate everything out of existence and have the government control every single aspect of everything to do that innovation at the presses that that spirit that daring do that the American business person has\nA so it's a great big contrast and philosophies and that that's what that's what we're voting for every single time we go to the ballot box flown like\nMost other politicians are especially on the left side of the aisle the progressive left liberal socialist Democrats President Trump backed up his campaign talk with a specific promissory pledged that there's government would cut to regulations for each of uh every\nNew one knows added the results are as follows the Trump Administration issued one hundred and Seventy six deregulatory actions last year eliminating twelve or\nRegulations for every new one added\nTo that that's amazing and this is what's driving the left crazy\nBecause they find their their\nTheir greatest joy I I guess in in in ... in loading power over people in that sense but what really should be happening in the United states of America obviously we know we know we have regulation we know that we know we read that we need to have laws that govern things and so forth of course\nBut when you literally have strangling a business it's just going to have the er at a detrimental effect or to the point where at at the end of the Obama administration it you know unless President Trump was elected and start doing what he was doing I think we'd be living in a very different country at this point\nBy the way Rush Limbaugh yesterday said this on the radio he said who is providing food water and high Jenike facilities for the four thousand caravan members from the Honduras going through Mexico\nYes good question but at the end but again Russia didn't get that right they're not all from Mexico [noise] no because they're coming in I think from Honduras Guatemala and Guatemala yeah and whoever else they picked up along the way\nIt exactly ... exactly yeah that that's that's a big deal and it becomes a stone and that's another sad part of the whole thing because it becomes just add a stunt\nGuy can you stick around for a new segment of course okay good All right well Kyle of Iran or right after the break here bottom of the hour news coming back and
