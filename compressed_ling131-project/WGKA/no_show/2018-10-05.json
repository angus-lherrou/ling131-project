all these other folks that applies to all of us we have the right as you mentioned even if someone disagrees you still have a right so far in this country most the time to to speak about whatever that happens to be especially when it's something to do with a you know your core beliefs\nWell I think that there's some truth that ... that you really have to be bold the only way it's because it's a spiritual battle right and the enemy wants us to be cowed\nAnd to just shut up I'm just going to shut up God says no be bold be strong for the lord your God is when you\nUm if if we are not bold and strong for our faith we really are becoming part of the problem we have to be bought so I Would say the only way to counter this has to be bolder in our faith to talk about Jesus more in the public

with liberty and justice for all\nAnd we emphasize to George ladies and gentlemen under God this great country of ours was founded on Judeo Christian\nValues well Kyle a Morning Joe yesterday um got into some ... some discussion here talking about how this cabinet thing has in Syria to the country and I'm going to double down on this but first I Want you to hear about a minutes worth of a\nA a gentleman let's see who is this guy he's worth the Josie with who is he would always do with the Associated Press and he's a reporter by the name of Lamar and\nHe's just talked about the fact that this cabin on mobile has absolutely\nEnraged an energized Republicans listen to this description coming from a morning Joes a show\nIn Democratic Senate seat in danger of Fox News polling says Republicans they can gain in a number of ballot ground Senate race is heading into November in North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp who is one of the most vulnerable Democrats this here is trailing her Republican challenger Kevin Cramer by\nTwelve foot off right there on our mayor of of all the races right now Heidi Heitkamp seems to me the Democrat through a boy or is he just seems like a very endangered right now and unlike every other Democrat and these tight races [noise]\nHard to imagine how she uh fights are way back especially with the Kavanaugh votes still in front of\nHer that's alright strategist that I talked to on both sides of the party put her as the most Democrat by far that poll that showed right there really underscores that are there are other states Missouri and so on their Democrat where Republicans might have a slight edge I'm sure we'll get some of those ... minutes but this one of the er Hi Kathy Steele is in real trouble\nAnd they think that this Kavanaugh moment here has absolutely has energized Republicans who is you've been saying really despondent really down about how the spring and summer have gone and now feel like they have something to fight for now it will be interesting to see\nDoes that enthusiasm persist if Kavanaugh work to be seated on the patch like if if he comes through that is right on the best as you is this as an almost anger like a justified like\nHow they're treating our guy like this how could they deny him if he doesn't make it\nThen yes I Do think that would continue if he does get on desolate dissipate I mean that's what we'll see in the weeks ahead\nNow a couple of things Kyle first of all Heidi Heitkamp yesterday said that she is going to vote against justice cabinet that his sealed or fate she will lose her seat and lose it by double digits\nIt exactly right you're right we heard earlier today that that was her decision and that and certainly you know she may have had a fighting chance perhaps but of course now that that's the way it looks\nAnd secondly I don't know about you and your travels but I stopped at four different places yesterday before it came to the radio station and I met with the Republicans would Democrats with independence with liberty libertarians were the people that just were curious what not\nMatter of fact I met with some people that hadn't even registered to vote yet and they were debating whether or not they should and I think I talked to several people into doing that because I told them I says you know I says if you don't like what's going on\nAnd you don't like what you think might go on with certain candidates getting elected and you don't vote you got no reason to complain right\nExactly right so so consequently a I found out in with the chats or what's happening with these people and I probably talked oh I don't know a hundred and fifty people roughly yesterday maybe more than that I quit counting and ah\nThey're mad as hell they're not going to take it anymore and this Kavanaugh thing has absolutely infuriated them whether or not they were Democrats Republicans independents libertarians because they realized this could happen to them\nYou are not guilty until proven innocent in this country you are innocent until you are proven guilty that is a basic rights\nOf our legal and justice system the way it's set up and the Democrats are clearly stated this week with their intentions were their actions that they want to reverse that and that\nIs absolutely wrong\nIt's absolutely wrong and for American um but here's the funny thing we're hearing from people that are interviewed is part of these mobs of protesters and so forth\nThey all like to use the same fate allergy they like to say this is a job interview and there is no presumption of innocence in a job interview which you know it sounds like they're you know somebody is sort of you know helping them along\nAnd where are they getting that are democratic talking points and has been since the beginning\n... exactly and of course it doesn't ring true you know it it it can no American that I Know captain does it ever ring true that someone can simply bring unsubstantiated charges against someone in order to ruin their life or in this case to get a a\nA political agenda across those kind of thing nobody across the highways and by way\nBelieve that it's okay to get rid of the presumption of innocence foundational structure of our entire society it makes it it but to see the scorched earth is actually that the Democrats are willing to do\nTo our republic is unconscionable it really is\nWell yeah and we're talking to warn professor politics as we do a six nights of five nights a week here last night which we know a rich turn and uh I don't know ... you said you didn't hear the show you need to hear we lift it up last night\nFound the ad but yeah I'm going to go back\nAnd listen I guess now the other thing is the FBI report that has come out of there just is absolutely no hint of misconduct no core operation no proof\nThey interviewed nine witnesses including some new people that were uh had been interviewed before there was no reason to interview\n'em a Ford and all that because she said she had nothing further to say and everything she said was on his foreign statements\nAnd by the way what she said was refuted by her boyfriend and one other witness who said it never happened\nHold that thought ... votes to be right back with more with the professor of politics Kyle warned us as the captain's Americans or watch\nEverybody

David didn't mind God's judgments for mistakes made but these were ... lies against him I'm Talking about life that we just uh the ... so let's go further into this\nThen he says horror has taken hold of me because of the wicked that for the law and I can can you all just imagine the horror when your whole\nFamily is threatened by the way that I it hard for me to believe that the judge and his wife has children believe me people they were threatened and ah and king David ... calls it horror\nAnd then he goes on to state it is good for me this is something this is good for me this something he says it is good for me that I'd been afflicted that I made better learn your statutes\nAnd do the proud have forged ally against me either light in your law and I could and that's kind of kept a how the captain how the judge kind of help no ...
