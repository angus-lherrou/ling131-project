when a cat and how are you\nI'm doing great time you say the pledge already sure I pledge allegiance to the flag\nOf the United states of America as a Republican for which is and one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all and let's not forget those two words under God because our great country was founded on Judeo Christian values\nWell we got to start out with uh what's been going on here were these doggone a pipe bombs for lack of better words that's what they're calling I'm technically I guess that's what they are but a seven of them I Believe were sent out yesterday they went to\nA whole bunch of a Democrat operatives of the key thing that I'm thinking about here Wayne is and this was amateurish at best the way they were made because a true bomb maker wouldn't have had a bomb sent to somebody that wouldn't have gone off when you started to mess with a package\nNobody knows where all guessing I say that I Know where you know and none of us knows yet let's see what the FBI to say but\nYou know sit on my show tonight both radio TV\nTo me it looks like a full fledged yeah to me it looks like liberal an sci fi radical socialist whatever\nGeorge Soros type of people who tried to make us be sympathetic towards Democrats can write and towards Obama towards ... and it just doesn't smell right the fact that none of them went off it was so amateurish it seems like no one really intended to hurt anybody\nI mean thank God no one was hurt no one thing we want to be hurt but the fact that no one was\nShows that they were looking to create sympathy for the Democratic heroes they're looking to make Republicans look bad they were looking to take all the headlines that are out there about this kind of an off the front page headlines right and the momentum by the GOP which is winning every early election in every battleground state in the country\nTo my state Nevada yeah that's the only state where Democrats are at nearly voting seven points you know but but in the rest of the country were\nWinning everything and they need it to try and do something out of desperation to change the momentum that is what it seems like it feels like to me but I Will say this much so nobody missed votes me if it was a conservative that did it and I don't believe it was but if it was\nObviously it's despicable it's horrible it's disgraceful and we uh you know we are far away from any pursued ever do such that\nWell I totally agree and uh\nI totally agree with what you just said because this is what I thought to begin with because the first thing I noticed was ... was Twitter blew up and there was a whole bunch of these are progressive somewhere out there using the hash\nTag M. A. G. A. bomber okay you'll make America great again bomber for those that don't understand what I'm AJ Jay means and all of a sudden that exploded out there on shorter and I'm going there is no evidence there's no nothing\nWho the hell are these people putting it out there well obviously this to me like it was a concerted effort\nYeah and it was interesting because uh you know you could tell what they were going to say they're going to say the world bunch crazy red necks that's it crazy right wing or is the next thing I Know somehow I've gotten on this text list of the Democratic party in Nevada and they constantly send me text to get out the vote\nAnd they were saying that you will not stop us from voting you don't want the ... that's what the bombing was about it was crazy right wing or is it well then what black people to vote and I sat there going oh my God it's like they scripted it than they did it and then they said that the text about it well a little\nWhile when I have a a secret email address so it's not real meat per se and I get things from the DNC all the time I ... totally aware of what they're up to because I use the second email address I got\nTo let me ask you this do you get taxed at the things that might have said first for minor in Spanish I Do wish I'd do second of all they said Donald Trump constantly I Do which I Can't believe you're allowed to even say something like that I Can't either by the name of that to me yesterday\nWe need you to vote early and often vote once during the early voting and vote again on election day right that's a federal crime\nYeah plus they're telling the illegals in California to come out and vote\nFor the whole thing with the legal then they said again and again\nDonald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump the ...\n... it's a it's a crisis do it said you know the anti Christ yup\nAnd by the way the interesting George so as we all know is funding this caravan sure\nWhen they interview the people in the caravan of bunch of foreigners eight American market flag you know what did they say they see Donald Trump the anti Christ you know so it's interesting the sauce is funding to get out the vote drives it sauce it's funny the caravan and they both say the exact same words it's like they're reading off its saw script\nDid you see the people in a caravan marching where the ISIS flag\nI did not see that but I Do know that almost every one of the Caribbean eighty percent plus our military age males naturally I Know of course their ice people mix it with them there's no question\nMy name is Thirteen too

... in the sky hundred dollars a month for me that he took office in a covered everything and that was two thousand covered nothing facts Obama\nWill help is on the way we got about a minute left here and to help on the way is the fact that some of these premiums are starting to drop but it's because of the fact there is no longer a mandate\nQuite ... no longer a mandate and and you've got Trump is president he's done quite a few things to ease the burden these a lot of small businesses to by outside their their state and and a combined with a small business for a cheaper rate you know and and

you want a new careers and you want a new future some new directions for this company to this country to grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and you want growth policies in the future\nIs only one way to vote and it's not for a Democrat because they're all for going back to the way it was because I think\nIt was better\nAnd it was a all the numbers prove differently\nWhich is why there will
