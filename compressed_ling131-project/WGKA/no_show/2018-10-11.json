in Bay county and levy county [noise] Valdosta\nA in a Jasper Lake City live oak\nHelp is on the way now it might not seem like it right now but help is on the way because I've been communicating with the emergency officials all day long to find out what's going on up there\nUm there's at least twenty thousand\nPeople involved in the mix that are going to get rolling out tomorrow morning at the first sign of daylight no unfortunately what all the trees that are down with all the wires that are down it's a dangerous situation\nUm you've been told to stay in your houses and don't go out tonight because the worst thing you can do is walk out there and get yourself electrocuted because you couldn't steal a live wire that was a uh in the water so to speak but this storm and now talk to you in this storm where's the fourth most powerful storm in the history of America\n[noise] you know I guess I was naive I went on my shirt tonight and I said it's a miracle I don't know how it could be the fifth or for the most powerful storm in the history of America\nAnd there's one person one guy got hit by a tree and his in his house and he died it just doesn't seem possible how can we be that good I guess I was being naive as I Do a lot of bodies just sit there and they do not find them\nYeah well we're hoping because three hundred thousand people shelter in place but all of the older homes or weren't build up to code to take a category for two mile short of a category five storm had been destroyed and I mean flat destroyed and I'm afraid they're going to find some things that ah\nAh is not going to be very pretty because uh it's just the inevitable and by the way this was the third most intense storm with the middle of our pressure of nine Nineteen comparable to Hurricane Andrew and you know what Hurricane Andrew did\nOh incredible decisions you forget about just the bodies that could be found [noise] but I guess the the area muscle look like a war zone\nAnd does it absolutely does in Bay county is ground zero for this but ah every other area where this storm when a has been severely affected and it went into Georgia's a category three hurricane that is never happened\nYeah just amazing stuff I mean there there isn't much on the news about the devastation nobody really knows yet I guess until until the sun comes up in the morning is that the deal\nUh yeah and there'll be aerial shots than and whatnot because they were pretty much doing ground shots today and they were staying pretty close to\nThe where there were at because there was too dangerous to go wandering and uh the crews are going to get out and get in that except maybe for the the Weather Channel but those guys were mostly on the beach but anyway let's talk about something that I Know that we always like to talk about and that's politics and uh\nI got to play a little short clip here of Mr Eric Holder who is rumored to be a presidential candidate in twenty twenty but just listen to what Mr Eric Holder had to say that really upset the apple cart\nThey have to use the power that they have gotten more along the wrong things they want to keep themselves in that they want to teeter to special instance it is time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are going to be as dedicated as they are to be committed as a\nCello is this is all over you know my wife like really tight ...\nSays you know when they go low we don't know\nThey go low we\nDid you hear that when they go low we kick him\nI heard it they're they're not going to rest until someone gets assassinated until

all day today you know what do you make of that and I don't really have an answer [noise] um I made a guest on Twitter and I have no idea what am I guess would be accurate but it is possible that Trump is firing a sessions after the\nAfter the election I think that's a high probability is it possibly troops the fluid Lindsey Graham\nAnd if so would that mean there'd be an opening for US Senate in South Carolina Nikki Haley might be the perfect person to nature what I I really can't think of any other reason why shooter resigned such a high profile post you know unless you have any family troubled marriage troubles that you know it's a personal issue I just don't see any reason why you would you would you give up a great position like that\nYou must have listened to my show last night because I said exactly what you just said about the personnel files been laid off the ground will become the attorney general and that uh uh Nikki Haley will probably wind up being appointed the interim US Senator and a\nLot that's what happened appointment incorrect real so by the way it does I think the governor\nThe governor registering right on al ... and\nHe's obviously good friends and he was her lieutenant\nGovernor that's right absolutely right and that's why I said that's the way it's going to fall on ... the\nThe only they only make friends you know because you know when you

say that the rates might be going down the cost of many Medicare plans are decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate help markets offers a free service with access\nTo thousands on Medicare plan plans I can eliminate you're out of pocket cost plans with zero dollar premiums and even plant that pay you back\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind with so many new options it can be confusing even get objected to help to find a plan that may cost wet and cover more with lower co pay more choices like dental vision and prescription drug coverage\nAnd now in Nebraska saying hello to us and he's saying my concern for November is fraudulent voting\nYeah well that's certainly the only way Democrats can win at this point it's not just for voting it's allowing millions of illegals to vote but they voted in two thousand sixteen I have no doubt most I'm In California California is a lost cause it doesn't matter in the rest of the country one big\nAnd so they they don't have enough illegals to overcome our edge I think will do just fine remember this isn't like the sixteenth presidential election where you actually have to win one on one Trump over Hillary Clinton you know even was electro ... to win\nBut there is a a cherry laundered rational situation were districts are all kinds of hodgepodge created away but we have a huge huge Republican so

congressional pulled arrest me isn't shows even forty five forty five time which means we pick up a seat\nMhm now did you see the president signed legislation to help patients save him prescription drugs did you come to catch them\nI didn't catch it but I'm sure that the reason I didn't catch it because of the media doesn't make a big deal out of it he does great things they don't cover it\nWell of course what he did was uh to uh help patients that are having problems with their prescriptions and it's a known as the lowest price act impatience right to know drug prices act or were signed a this afternoon\nAbide the president and ah this is something that's going to put an end hopefully to the gag clauses for patients on either Medicare private plants where they can just Jack the price up with no warning\nWell that's good news it's something you'd expect when Obama and Republican presidents that's good I mean he's fighting for the people he's fighting for working people no one he shoals dynamic\nOf politics you know Republicans used to be known as a just the rich guys are all helping the rich guys Donald Trump helps the working class in the middle class and I think it's great I just wish he hadn't signed it today I think that that's terrible\nUh timing because you know that hurricane will be all anyone talks about in the morning or the damage from hurricane Michael so I mean you got to postpone things like that for a few days because the media will never recover what he did say never\nSo uh you and I consider ourselves to be civil people right right\nIt was Hillary talking about what the un civility of the ... of the Republicans are saying\nThe same thing I recall it was talking about they want to hurt us they want to kill us they want assassinate us they want to arrest us they want to persecute us there just terrible people I got to tell you the leadership\nAnd they do now Democrats terrible people but the leadership of the Democratic party the people you
