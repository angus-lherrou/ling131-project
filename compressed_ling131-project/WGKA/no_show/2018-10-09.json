Iran he was in Shreveport, Louisiana he would preach in times square church and he talked about this that that that they would\nWalk right neighborhoods and pray for people and he remembers that they prefer this guy and one time after they paid for him a few times he was able to see and you know ... it's just nuts so yeah just absolutely stunning\nOf of spend a lot of times it takes a few times we had this will happen to be a meeting again number of years ago but um when Ken was in to our church and my\nMy right hand guy Brent walked in this one night with a crutch\nAnd after the kids prayed over him actually probably eleven times to crush turned into a serpent it did not a good good but he walked out with a crutch over his shoulder\nSo he he experienced the change in a blue is Mike in a wonderful way of course it blew his mind and he's just never forgotten about that either you know\nI tell you we don't when when you start thinking about this just logically that if God can do this it really feels like why wouldn't we push in even more\nTo see more and more and more because lives have changed I mean if somebody doesn't believe in Jesus and you pray for them and something happens to boy oh boy that's I mean that's how people came to face when Jesus was walking this er yeah yeah so why wouldn't we try it today that's what I'm\nThinking like Jesus didn't have um events he just

came to our church for ... and I was sitting with her with another person and um she had not slept in about eight years slip well in eight years from when um she experienced that her husband walked out on her\nAnd so I'm One of the things that we did as we're praying for her I felt this I'm kind of a ... really stiff thing in the back of her neck and you would call that a demonic manifestation spiritual manifestation really Shia rape and you know I mean Syrian okay yeah yeah absolutely and so\nAs we pray for her trying to figure out why is she not sleeping right now and there was some other

and safe and don't forget to check out the captain's America third watch dot com the website the captain's America third\nWatch dot com well here is cow and a professor of politics they call\nIt got them all righty let's say the or let's say the pledge and get rolling you ready I sure am like ...\nTo the lack of the United states of America and I'm to the republic for what you're saying one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all\nAnd we emphasize the two words under God this great country of ours was founded on Judeo Christian values well Kyle does start with the obvious hurricane Michael\nAt one am a central time two am my time\nOr the center of hurricane Michael was located by an air force reserve reconnaissance aircrafts near latitude twenty three point six north longitude eighty five point seven west Michael is moving towards the north northwest at twelve miles per hour\nA north towards the north northwest for motion and a slightly faster forward speed is expected through tonight followed by the north east the ah easterly motion on Wednesday and then again on Thursday and on the forecast track\nThe center of Michael will continue to move across the southeastern gulp on a New Mexico this morning that move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico later today and tonight the center of Michael's expected to move inland over the Florida Panhandle\nOr for the Big Bend area on Wednesday and then move north east toward across the southeastern United States Wednesday night and Thursday until it emerges back out in the ocean again now what's important about this storm ladies and gentlemen\nIs if it stays in the pan handle\nThose of us over here on the eastern side of the Gulf will be fine but if that goes in a further to the east and comes in around the Big Bend area then we will have a some substantial rain substantial wins\nNot necessarily the hurricane force winds are going to have up in the panhandle but we certainly will have more than just a thirty or forty mile an hour wind which is what we could see right now and Kyle I think you know the difference between all that\nWell that you're right and we also understand too that Alabama\nIs already declared a state of emergency corporation for all of this as well and I think captain that just as we've seen a with the previous hurricanes and major storms come to the region a preparation is key um especially if you need to evacuate\nAnd if you do need to evacuate make sure that you have things like medicine or that you would need to be able to take and so forth um and do these kinds of things before it gets too late to storm was bearing\nDown well since you and I talked to last a the storm's winds have increased by some twenty miles per hour because reports from the hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained winds are Ninety miles per hour was hired Gus towards the center of the storm\nA steady to rapid strengthening us forecast during the\nNext day or so and Michael is expected to become a major hurricane or more than likely a category three with winds approaching a hundred and thirty\nMiles per hour before it comes on shore all the problems are not just the rain and wind it's the storm surge\nAnd the storm surge ladies and gentleman listen to these numbers and then pay attention and if you know how high above sea level fine but listen to this from Indian past forwarded to cedar key Florida eight to twelve foot storm surge that's where the highest water's going to be so far\nOff from crystal river Florida which is just up the road I don't know um Mm about Seventy five miles from me\nAll the way to cedar key storm surge will be six to eight feet\nFrom Oprah Los ... Lewis a wall county line forward it to the union passing four to six to nine feet from crystal river to the ... river in Florida four to six street\nFrom the Platte River down to Anna Maria island which is right here outside Tampa Bay two to four feet and from the Alabama Florida border to the ... county line two to four feet now that's they left side west side of the storm which is always the better side to be on\nIt exactly right exactly right and so um but the storm surge of again or nothing to travel with a at all that's all people die\nExactly and so the low lying areas are very near sea level and so forth and they talk about it to a four foot storm surge that that's an awful lot of water coming into your house a potentially and so again people have to be prepared and they have to be prepared to leave\nLocal authorities told them to do so because you may be cut off from from rescue or other services for for a long time and if this comes through like that\nAnd to our listeners up there and Jasper I'm One of those seven five north Florida oh you're in the past and to our listeners in Valdosta Ninety two one you are in the past you need to pay close attention and listen to what your emergency officials are telling you do not monkey around because you are going to see\nHundred mile an hour plus wins coming in your direction with the rain or with the um the flooding within the brain with it won't need to worry about the storm surge up that far but there are certainly will be a no brainer enough when a to do lots of damage and be prepared to be without power for a while\nIt precisely and that's why again it's so important to have a plan and ordered to evacuate a prior to the storm coming into your area\nIf that's if that's of all possible um unfortunately captain receive from folks who want to ride out storms I'm about something ... something very bad can happen or you can be without power for very long time and that they mentioned you can be cut off\nFrom a emergency responders to be able to get you have led a medical emergency for example\nAnd one of our listeners James just chimed in from high here in Georgia which is near Valdosta faces a I'm a paper man\nAnd more than likely I'll be out in it I Am ready do I've got the generator gassed up and ready to go at the home well you know James be careful and don't take any new not necessary chances are they're trying to deliver the paper because again or at night and I've gone through it myself at night when the power lines go down you can't see 'em\nYou can't see them and if they're energized\nAh that's very bad and now they may turn off the power in some areas in and said precautions you don't know you\nHold that thought folks and when we come back we're going to talk about all sorts of things because it's been an interesting day just say the least politically and judge Kavanaugh is now officially while he was anyway but he's south as ceremony ... a a justice will tell you I

though they you know we're doing our best there with prayer and fact because of all this this week I'm just going to start shouting out of blessings and early night so if you get on line and I still have a phone and electricity [laughter] the next show\nWould start our regular and then I'm going to have a second night because the captain has more names I get them from and it'll take two nights so ones that have fun having a blessing and\nThe reason I don't can't just do the ... by without because I have to pray I Do special prayer for those [noise]\nSo um but tonight I'm just going to go kind

special I don't just use that I use that word too loosely because really really those um I Do pray for a before those and\nAnd we're going to really I don't think I think it's a probably a good way to put them out and you know the more positive energy we put out and I said this before\nThe more positive and faith and pray or however you do it it brings good to you not bad so it's probably a good thing we do those\nUm and then then you all can be doing the same thing but we really need to keep praying because for all those in the path of the store and I mean all those up up in the northern part they get it of course I also call to prayer or a a person to a\nVery very good ... a person that put a lot of prayer especially well not to be selfish especially to pray around on because I mean you know that's what I Do we can't go to every area and I just hope this thing doesn't hit the Carolinas again but anyway I'm\nGoing I Know I knew that right and I didn't want to even say lord have mercy\nOn about you know what I\nBought I heard and I said no I didn't hear that\nBut the best thing we can do is you know I Want to say this though faith does play a role I mean I Know things are happening we're used to them but um\nI've seen many ... by the way I never thought I'd be repeating these words for us in the eye of the storm it's along song but but just a few words for for all of us for for Florida wherever it hits in any where it goes\nIn the eye of the storm the remaining controlled for God in the middle of in the middle of the war you garden my so\nIll alone guard or the anchor when my sales are torn you are a lot around me in the eye of the storm my only hope is my trust and you and we trust any lord in the eye of the storm called Michael never thought I'd have to say that one first locally here again\nOkay I have something I Want to or I don't know if I'll get it on I talk too much but that really and truly we there's no special message today except I Do have something about faith that was sent to me it's a little book from minister I thought it was nice [noise]\nLet me read it on the radio recently I heard someone say just when we think they're taking away all our hope our faith ships than I Am filled with hope again and we go and try again this is the nature of faith in the dark night of kicks in and filled with hope\nOur world today and I'm skipping a paragraph here\nOur world today demands that we have faith especially when it seems there isn't much of a chance for you all up there in the eyes of the storm when we pray with faith and have hope when we live and act with faith we open\nTo the possibility for good to happen we create the weight for good solutions to manifest and by the way it is one thing I feel it we create the weight for good solutions that manifest and become real for us in the world\nSo let's keep as positive as we can do it we can\nObey the official\nAnd Hebrew tells us now faces the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen I'll be praying over this hurricane as much as I can be with your tomorrow night and the next night with blessings because it never hurts the show those out

meantime God Bless you all keep your faith keeps strong we don't want this thing to turn too much to do the right [laughter]\nKeep it keep it as far left as it can kill it down on the weekend it
