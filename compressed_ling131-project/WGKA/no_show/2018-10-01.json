service to America plus tore him teaser firefighters are police hospital Iran workers are nine one one dispatchers thank you very much for the great job you do keeping America safe and don't forget\nTo check out my website the captain's America's third watch dot com well joining us right now is Kyle warrant a professor of politics they go\nCaptain another start to a great week absolutely let's say the pledge and get rolling you ready for sure and I ... to the flag of the United states of America\nAnd to make for which there saying one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all\nAnd we emphasize the two words ladies and gentlemen under God because there's great country of ours was founded on Judeo Christian values and don't forget it now there's no doubt in my mind\nKyle ah when this woman uh who came out and a Tuesday a judge judge Kavanaugh to begin with this a bully sea Ford or we'll just call her ... what you want to be called by the way I just want to be called Blasey\nNo and I met exactly sure just keeping hearing leaving the Senate does your photos Dr Ford and so I suppose yeah\nWell the the fact of the matter is just she wasn't enough to benefit from anything and there was no way that she was going to she was just reporting her pour a story and ... and all of the sudden over the weekend since last Wednesday or Thursday\nThere's eight hundred and thirty thousand dollars sitting in the Gulf on me page for her\nThat's right that was even referenced that the ah hearings and I think she said she didn't know much about it and how it worked but\nUm it is very interesting the captain and that's a pretty good chunk of change and anybody that pocket book obviously um and then we understand that go from the accounts are typically seen as being gift personal gifts from somebody to somebody else that's right so it's not considered taxable income\nThat's right now here's what I have a suggestion to make here to her and all the people of that are supporting her if she is legitimate\nAnd if she really wants to do the right thing she will take every bit of that money and give it to the to the women's rights rape centers crisis centers\nUh uh women's abuse centers anything that's got a anything to do with the subject of cheese are trying to talk about that's what she would do if she's got any sense of credibility or decency and all that in my opinion\nYeah sensibly we understood had something to do with a hiring security this kind of thing but it I think you're right I think that would be a wonderful gesture and certainly would help to buttress so you know what she's saying and certainly the the topic that we're that we're talking about is a national conversation and that is I'm a woman being attacked\nWell she doesn't need security sees a horror stories of doesn't have a hundred holes in it\n[laughter] All right you know I'm obviously a you know it's interesting to see how this sort of breaks down that um I don't know how many minds will change per se according to some of these different reports but that being said once again I think the the big issue that we're looking at\nIs our people presumed innocent until proven guilty they are yeah and unfortunately I think the Democratic senators on the committee and others in the Senate whoever chimed in about ... they seem to have had no problem at all no problem at all just checking that out the window a literally checking it out the window\nA which I think is that terrible terrible thing we all we all want to get to the truth\nBut we have to go through the proper process well\nApparently the a female prosecutors they brought in from Arizona they ask questions as spoke up over the weekend and she said this is a he said she said case\nWhere she would not charged judge Kavanaugh for anything that she heard brought up or discussed and says that there's many key elements undecided miss forward that are in question because there was absolutely no proof whatsoever\n[noise] All right because in in\nThis libel and slander where I come from\nWell right right but there's there's no there's no physical evidence or there's no um ability for you know everybody talks about the eye investigation and they'll go talk to the witnesses and produce um you know witness statements obviously\nBut there is no ... they can't go to a house where this occurred they don't know exactly when it occurred date it if it's also nebulous that if this was a criminal proceeding they're simply not be any evidence to move forward and fortunately I understand that that can be the case\nIn many different rape allegations and criminal cases but in this particular case the one that we're talking about obviously there's nothing to move forward with and so obviously it's it's it's a non starter\nAnd of course the FBI is moving\nA great speed because one of the things that they do and they do very well as a background investigation\nAnd they already started that over the weekend and they've already interviewed a couple of people reportedly I don't know for sure but I'm just gonna say reportedly or they have been interviewed a couple of people and one of them this come forward just mark judge you said that he's willing to talk to the FBI in private and answer all the\nQuestions and they are going to him and he will\nBut that's exactly right and up and certainly I I don't know that we're going to hear anything different from the different name to people who have already given statements for one thing that they've given statements to the Congress under oath\nUnder oath and under penalty of perjury it's all men penalty of felony this kind of thing so in other words ... there's a lot of consequences that will be there if they suddenly start you know changing the story now what how they\nDo if they do they run the the possibility being charged for perjury why didn't you say this is the first time you can't just say well oh gosh well I forgot\nAll right well what I think captain I think what the Democrats are hoping for beyond the just the obvious delay and taking several more days to do this and then several more days after that\nThis kind of thing what they're hoping for is just exactly what Senator Whitehouse I think was talking about\nWas this idea that you run down things and then you get the other ... basically and you go down those roads and in other words they're looking for an endless investigation if not investigation or if they ever see concluding anything as long as just as it just kinda goes on forever\nAnd the Supreme Court only have eight justices for as long as we can go and we get to the midterms\nOkay well hold that thought when we come back kosher will tell you why this is not going to go on this way for very long will tell you why it's not going to do that\nAnd I'll be right back with more with Taiwan and a professor of politics don't go anywhere [noise] this is the

hurt eight hundred and thirty thousand dollars and county\nOkay so that tells me what the goal was there where's the money I don't even know anything else except that amount of money and they go find me page that's all they need to know the second one was ... by the way\nA had no end by the way ms Ford had no proof misery mirrors had no proof including remember where it was let alone who was there

... by the way\nOr the more I thought about this and the more I looked at her uh she's very familiar to me I don't know how but somehow or another she's very firm that pictures of very familiar picture I maybe I'll figure it out later but she's had legal\nCases she's been involved in six in the past twenty five years in Maryland in Oregon and in Florida\nAnd in one of those cases she falsely reported a college degree on the job application and was then charged with that even though the charges were dropped because there was a government job believe it or not I don't know where to government was but uh 'cause I haven't been able to find out I'll just that it was a\nA government job and she lied under application about having a college degree and she's been involved in six of these legal cases\nI'm In the past twenty five years and she hasn't won any of them\n[noise] that's right and and certainly\nOn top of all that the claims that she's making through Mr having already are so incredibly ridiculous that it's it's it's just so sad because what's happening to captain as as women who have actually\nBeen assaulted in our nation or are they are they are just a\nA I think there'll being completely designer to buy all of this sort of grandstanding and making the stuff up it's terrible the actual women out there who who need help and need counseling and need justice and

be a great new deal we understand especially in terms of access to us dairy farmers also has to do with Canada or putting a cap on automobile exports to the United states\nSo this is ultimately and as

exactly what I'm One of the many reasons but one of the primary reason why the American people I think wanted to put him into the oval office and that is to make sure that business wise America is

back come it's an merited love in favor of God toward human kind but it comes through forgiveness\nWe have to ask forgiveness and repack now want to have something about John Newton I'm John Newton was um he wrote that song but there's more to it\nA jar Newton was I'm a young scoundrel with go there very bad as young guy what he did was he took place they had slave ship and all the capital of the story very well and they would\nTake them on these big shift in chains take them to where the prospective buyers would be that's how we make money well he did that well what happened was when the navy ships would come close\nThey would have to get what they did with slave you can get right over board it was murder of course I kept the overboard like yeah and it happened to him on and uh\nI remember him saying a cause I read it where he said that should have been me but he kept doing it but at twenty two years old he became a Christian sometimes you're a Christian and it takes a while to still kind of get over it it took him a while because he was so used to this is his way of life\nBut let me tell you it affected his whole life to this is where God's Grace came in a jar new ... during the time he he was feeling so bad because as I said he did say that should have been me he knew that was wrong\nOr what yeah you don't take people into that but I wouldn't they eat it and many ... at that time he wrote down into this during that time [noise] bored\nTo two hundred and eighty him we now have I didn't even know that because they have no probably by John knew they were words he wrote because he felt so very guilty and bad now that alone should be enough\nBut I'm In and I'm going to read you an end it with with part of that uh the great song because people are you watching what's going on yeah we're all in too and I believe even going to be on the rise even more so\nI mean there were so many things going on even people dying of cancer I mean I had so many calls this

partner takeover and I got into that point this weekend\nI'm very very very um ... but I Want to end this at a good way uh it always in in good when you turn to God he became an Anglican courage human\nAnd and I'm going to ... just a few of the words that I've given before about gray\nA because that was the first song course amazing great because he knew that with God's Grace that brought him through all the things but he even as a clergyman he took the lowest job because it affected him his whole life if you just can't do that in and it knocked\nAnd we as America we know now we have got to have God's Grace over we need to read that we need to forgive whatever it takes I Will do whatever it takes fast whatever we cannot have this continue as it is because it could get worse it could not saying it will\nAmazing grace how sweet the sound is what he wrote and I love the way he said that saved a wretch like me you're the he knew he'd been rich he admitted it where I Believe this was his first song\nI once was lost but now I found was blind but now I see through many dangers toy open layered I have already come well he did too because remember Everytime these words meant a lot to him and should the U.S to because he knew every time he went out there if they caught him oh\nIt was great that brought me safe the bar and great will lead me home and I'm going to leave the all of
