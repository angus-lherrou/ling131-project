I mean and it's ... it's because of you that I Know any of this stuff but when I was writing in my book if you can keep it that Lincoln was down to me and again I first heard this from you was\nHis view his his\nHind view of the founders end of that generation and of what we have here in America it's clearly what we might call American exceptionalism it's clear that he sees that we are chosen by God that we've been given this tremendous\nA gift that we must treasure not just for ourselves but for the whole world I mean it's clear that he thinks that\nAnd I think today the left would give lip service to Lincoln he's some great die but they never go to that narrative to them no full pro American\nMarried a dead against it I was going to say but if they had against that ... to me the last great American who dressed it likes that was Martin Luther king to the declaration was a promissory note\nYou moved to circulate comical and then the rise of feminism him to Vietnam War movement some around sixty eight there was a fateful lunch left America went from being a liberal project with the Capitol Hill to being a less liberal project which was anti America as understood though the\nAnd since then America's being racist genocidal homophobic you name it\nAnd that's what the left believes today and it's and so the deadly well and of course she ... she was when Rudy do go cold for what he called the long march through the institutions picking up ...

website the captain's America's third watch dot com the captain's America's third watched dot com and without any further ado here's our for morning spectacular guessed that professor of politics cow or\nCaptain how's that for a title spectacular guests I I Love it\nI was wrestling amazing people last night let me tell you something might Gallagher who's my buddy uh Hugh Hewitt who has become a friend now as a result of comes from conversations we add Dr Sebastian Gorka the former a presidential advisor\nA and can't lean back in any who I did not realize lives in Tampa, Florida she's the national spokeswoman for the Republican National committee a nice new group of friends and we're gonna have we're going to take turns bringing ... radio show Dr Gorka to\nThat so that's one yeah now see the budget get rolling are you ready I sure am I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America and to the Republican but\nFor what you're saying then one nation under God indivisible with liberty and yes it is\nFor all and we emphasize those two words under God because this great country of ours was founded on Judeo Christian values or Kyle we know we've got a huge problem headed our way from\nEl Salvador and Guatemala and wherever else these people are coming from or something like four thousand people and their numbers gone from one thousand two thousand four thousand but I Want you to listen to a about a minute and a half here a Fox News\nWas talking about this and uh uh this is the conservative on ... on the panel let's see where's Charlie that did it to do\nWhereas here you can find his name here\nOr is it hurt is that you guys heard yeah yeah okay I I Believe that's who was who was it says but let's just get a minute and a half of him talking about what this is the editor direction here we go\nThat's how I heard opinion editor at the Washington Times benefactors contributor\nDown now passed wheelchair politics hassle reporter and Robert they were ... Santa Barbara I could just see all of these nighttime let me start with you you know with regard to the bigger issue of the border and walk us through voters' minds as they watch this caravan moving towards the United states and they are those numbers in fact\nThe numbers are increasing people adults now who bring a child with them when they come across the border because they know that if I had a child with that they will be allowed in\nWhich of course leads to a whole another problem that nobody on any side of this debate wants which is a uh the trafficking of children are and and there are many many documented cases where that is happening exactly for those reasons you just said\nUh you know it it's this is a this is not a good issue for I I Know that you know earlier in the year with the ... the so called separations and all that kinda stuff that was that was a boon for Democrats they thought that was a rallying cry with this issue the one thing that unites everybody on this issue is that we have to stop the problem\nAnd there are complex parts of it and there are a ... and it's it's not obviously it's not easy because these people in Congress\nHaven't been able to do it in decades neither party has done it but the idea you know the issue of do we have a secure border or do we need a wide open so that the problem continues that's a no brainer that that's like an aide twenty issue it\nAll right and let's talk about that eighty twenty issue because yesterday I don't know if you heard that you're not Kyle but the president threatened to some in the military to actually shut down the U.S Mexico border now in order to do that he would have to declare an emergency there'd have to be an emergency declared and approved by Congress I'm not sure that would happen\nHere for maybe I'm far off a week but I think what the president on August we can try to do with a statement like that is try to focus in\nUh the real issue that exist at the at the U.S Mexico border in other words it's not something that can be fixed by a by simply increasing this are increasing that a little bit uh we have to have a comprehensive approach to ah to stopping illegal immigration\n[noise] yeah and of course we know that uh there's also been a stretch you made about stopping a foreign aid for the countries involved in this which of course right now uh in originated apparently in Honduras but then it picked up steam as they went through Guatemala and they are they are not\nThrough Guatemala yet there's apparently a\nThis big group of people that are sitting\nRight there on the Mexican border of Guatemala waiting to come in and there's five or six or seven hundred additional a Mexican police are on that border or to make sure that they don't come sneak it in and what not\nUm they got to do it the right way and they're going to check them you're not going to see if they've got visas from their home country and if they don't then you've got to go back to their home country get them unless Guatemala will give them to them to come in Mexico\nExactly and I think it's also interesting to Capitol and the secretary of state Mike Pompeo made a statement earlier\nA talking about what's called the United nations high commissioner for refugees ... evidently they come up to us from agreement that those who would cross and presumably this caravan those who would cost to the United states\nCould be turned back in Mexico will accept them a now course in the larger scheme some may be found to have legitimate claims but those who do not have any legitimate can't claims will be immediately turned around others could be a candidate to find a host country\nCould be the United states of America could also be Mexico for example\nWell I Want you to listen to this the Washington Post reported this week the border patrol agents arrested sixteen thousand that's one six sixteen thousand\nSix hundred and fifty eight family members in September the highest one month total on record and an eighty percent increase from July according to unpublished to just do some of the department of homeland security those people did not\nDid not get allowed into the United states they were arrested they were detained there being processed and are being sent back where they came from\n... and you know there are processes by which people can enter this country illegally and that's the most they have\nStart to the home country and it came out or by getting these just to get out of their power and a professor of politics is with us we'll be right back with more at home\nIt says thank you everybody that showed up at the ... center in Tampa and uh I was just a fantastic of individuals that were there to see a great great event I'll be

right so she has a major following I if I was able to do that and my name is Rosie o'donald and I said hey the military needs to take this guy out getting him out of office to make the country better would that\nNot be an actress EDITION from where I'm sitting I think it is\nIt well yeah I mean honestly it it's about\nNot being a traitor because every single trader drainage right no it's called sedition advocating the overthrow the government\nAnd up by some other means other than uh I I think what is an Alec Baldwin the other day the lead to overthrow the government at the ballot box so that the way of stretching the rhetoric kind of but\nRosie O'Donnell is doing is really beyond the pale if from anybody estimation uh those kind of calls for that kind of thing belong in third world country a or some other kind of kind of place but not the United states of America and it's important to point out to captain that Rosie is out there saying things like\nI took a year out of the spotlight I got physically ill because Donald Trump was elected and all these kinds of Trump this full blown Trump arrangements syndrome\nTedious late ... yep and it's and it's so sad because instead of actually having\nA conversation about a ... you know ideas of philosophy political philosophy and so forth it becomes this thing and what it does captain it if it is it empowers crackpots who served as kind of thing and go yeah yeah that's what needs to happen\nAnd and I know what I'm going to mention right now lives have been more because she's got G. I. S. Trump Indian syndrome\nRight well you know and and and honestly I I don't know what some of these folks were do without Donald Trump is president of the United states it seems that\nThere are whole world is based on that and you know when when the Elizabeth Warren no relation by the way they win lose with Warren came out with her uh her with her DNA results\nYou know it really hit me that she was completely defined by Donald Trump there there's literally no aspect of Elizabeth in other words why would anyone vote for before and for anything other than\nOur anti Trump mess that's right and it and so obviously there's you know leaders emerging we vote for them because we think that they can get from point a to point B\nIt whether I mean even even for for for better or for worse could be Obama or it could be Reagan you know those kind of thing but people have there's something about them that people vote for\nBut for Elizabeth Warren there's only voting against Donald Trump that that's not a platform\nCan you stick around for another segment oh certainly okay good because when we come back from this break ditch fixing to come up folks are going to talk about the turkey thing and the Saudi Arabian thing because apparently\nA the president has reached in principle some sort of agreement with the Saudi crown prince and the Saudi king\nAh my palm pale in the middle of the mix there too and oh by the way one of the security people that was involved in whatever happened in Turkey was killed yesterday in an auto crash ... just a coincidence maybe\nI think not All right we'll
