Seventeen Seventy six and by the way uh\nWe've had so much of it than most people don't even know what it is and so I Do think that one of the reasons I Want to have both of you want us to to help people understand what is at stake this is not something that just happens in the newspapers this is real people\nFighting um thank you for I'm\nReferencing my book or a Jack and I I uh but I Want to say right back at you\nOr you become a hero to so many people because\nTo have to go through what you've been through\nUm you did not pick this as we just said you did not pick is and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom who knows we don't really want to think where you'd be right now um but it's terrible people's lives are being ruined a and we have to stand up and fight so now is Matt let me ask you you said that you're you're taking this\nIs it are you arguing in front of the civil rights commission first is that what you just said\nYeah so that's happening in parallel at the same time that we're actually trying to get all of the civil rights commission it's hearing a it's biased proceedings dismissed and so we're actually asking a federal court to step in and put an end to all of this\nUm set a jak doesn't have to be dragged through the same six year process again and that he can go back to doing what he loves\nOkay and and the ... which federal court is can you say\nYeah so we're in the federal district court of Colorado and so kind of the normal process you know will argue there hopefully get a victory but if not it will go up to the court of appeals and potentially back to the U.S Supreme Court um but we're hoping that\nUh we don't have to go that far that we can get a resounding victory and put an end to this ongoing hostility towards jak by the state of Colorado and\nAnd is your feeling that uh the the president of the ruling the Seventy ruling in December or will help the lower courts decide this\nYes or when the Supreme Court sent a clear message\nThat tells Colorado you can't have hostility towards jak you can't bring these proceedings against him because you don't like their beliefs and then as you know within weeks after that ruling Colorado is back at it again saying oh jak we're going to find another reason to find you in violation of our law\nWe think that's a strong demonstration of the exact hostility that seven members of the court found to be problematic and so I think that's a strong precedent um there were going to rely on and and hopefully the federal courts will look at that and say yeah\nThis is too much hostility this is unconstitutional um and and dismiss Colorado's charges against jak for the gender identity cake\nWell I mean I Want to be clear ah for folks listening that you know Jack you're Christian ... you're not an anti gay person you are a Christian we all that goes along with that so if somebody comes to you and says I'd like to bake a cake and says I hate gays and because you're a Christian you would not make that cake either\nThat's correct and I've had people with similar requests like I'm just going to do that all my work done or God Jesus Christ in every way that they can't do that I Can't honor him making cakes or hateful or go against his teaching [noise]\nWell I Want people to hear that because you you hear so much um [noise] you know\nObviously we're living in a time where are the news is very confusing and people say things and it's not corroborated but it gets out there and\nUh people try to paint folks like you or me for that matter as a bigot and you think well not only am I not a big yet but I fight bigotry in my life I care about these things just as you do or we may differ on our definition of bigotry but we don't take these things lightly\nUh and there are hateful people out there and you're not one of 'em and by God's Grace I'm not one of 'em and I think people even saying we are talking about religious liberty this is not\nThe liberty to hey

happening right now with the Democrats I've had a number of Democrats coming up to me going\nYou know we'll just selections portion of what we saw or are they said well I'm Jeanie or do you do you think do you think we got a chance any more I mean it looks like we're kind of losing their momentum here well maybe you didn't play the game right to begin with\nHow about that about that because back in two thousand and six chain\nMyself personally and maybe a handful of others were saying that we actually thought Donald Trump had a chance of winning the presidency and everybody called us names and said we were ...\nOkay well time we went with it but the dog to the election\nThere's particular radio show right here at one thirty three in the morning\nThat was the time we get a call the election for president Donald Trump or nobody else subtle word and the reason we did that was because Trump had two hundred and Seventy electoral votes\nAnd that's all it took to beat the president bingo to Seventy do something to do and don't look no\nBuddies Yogi Berra said years and years ago which day job view view all over again and here's what I mean by that\nHave you noticed the rallies lately with Donald Trump do you remember back in two thousand sixteen the rallies that were going on ten thousand twenty thousand thirty thousand forty thousand people\nFilling buildings filling stadiums\nAnd then they had to get bigger Venus people out in the street you remember that what are you seeing right now the same exact thing and Democrats were so certain winning the house\nThat they go so far is through a start to order new stationary and things like that you know and that the people that were going to be committee chairman and what not to reporting stuff Maxine Waters included picture that one Maxine Waters\nWell chairman of the banking committee oh and the Democrats\nChief fool and delusional prognosticators\nBack in two thousand six team was Nate Silver who gave them an eighty five percent chance of winning the house a sure right but fast forward to today now our president\nIs attracting ten thousand or more towards rallies wherever he goes small towns I mean each go the little places in Montana little places in Nevada he a matter of fact ... was on my program to let you go or last night last night sorry and we talked about the fact that he wants to alcohol\nAlcohol Tobacco\nEl ... doesn't have ten thousand people in it and they filled the free complacent room All right let's go to the phone lines get more does this year James I'm here are very good no I'm Talking about the Donald Trump or movement and the fact back in two thousand six gene I'm\nEverybody didn't give them a chance and he's starting to pack them in with these rallies and now here we are in two thousand and Eighteen and he's not on the ticket although he is on the ticket\nA and we've got the same scenario going on with the rallies I mean he just had a rally in Texas in Houston when they estimated they hadn't Seventy thousand people the stadium in ... or the building inside was totally bowl and they had to do this thirty thousand people in the street\nExactly and even in Tampa a the rally that we had the fairgrounds yeah recently yeah that was that was far more organized than they were far far more people that then we're there\nUh for the others they packed them real quick or plus there are more organized yeah [laughter] they learned from before or the protesters are corralled out an area that gets them out of the way and there's really no problems it runs really clean and move\nYeah it did and uh I can say that would certainly because I was there and we broadcasted life from that event and I rented to James there and we were standing there laughing\nAt a a that a CNN reporter who was a taking it from the crowd we do a lot of the people that were making noise and given it to them but ah I was right there where you had to walk by me three times and I said welcome to the United states of America when he walked by me the first time\nAnd uh he uh he didn't say anything when he came back he goes you know this is kind of fun and then he ... he enjoyed it because they were shaking hands up there he was signing autographs you're doing all kinds of stuff and you still come on come on and make some noise you don't 'cause we threw sugar and watched him\nHe's actually become part of the show\nYeah yeah and he loves it because she's getting attention that he wouldn't get otherwise a mutt but then again it is what it is and CNN as we used to call us to the Clinton news network and now I guess it's the communist news network again but the thing of it is James is that um the the desperation other part of the Democrats including Andrew Gillum\nHere in this state did you hear what he just said about the police\nIt was incredible high actually posted something about that and I and I just don't believe that anybody that feels that way about our law enforcement should be anywhere near a running our state\nAnd we don't hear it and hold that thought sir and we'll bring you right back right after this break we got James strengthen the president of the Tampa Bay a Trump club here that meets over and putting all those park they tell you all about that too but\nThere's a democratic candidates for governor had to say about the police

else\nThey news said that what does this have anything to do with your stance on the second amendment and eat\nIt clearly told them this is not the time to discuss anything like that right he stayed away from it stay down to business it was in charge getting something done the way you would expect when there was a crisis immediately following that same guy interviewed a Bill Nelson\nThey ask them what in Congress do to stop things like that is that right out of his mouth yeah he he hesitated just a second started popping in flattering like he does it immediately said that the um\n... the Republicans just turn down a chance to stop this by um by stopping legislation that would restrict the magazine capacity on those on the do not fly list\nAnd I just my jaw dropped I was like\nYeah what's that had to do with anything\nBut that's how fast this old man is on its feet and he does everything against the had to turn that try and turn this whole thing against Republicans and gun control instead of talking about how Congress and help\nYou know support states in support schools and support places and trying to do things he he just went right after Republicans or something so ridiculous the first thing that came to his mind\nBlowing notice from Bill Nelson went up into the hurricane affected area up there and Gulf county in Bay county and uh\nUh Leon county up and there was walking around looking as different things and he was talking about they were going to do this we're going to do that blah blah blah blah [noise] ah it had already been discussed a and and talked about and the Governor Scott it already signed paperwork to get it done by the federal government to have them help and uh it's like you were ... and all this\nWealth is always repeating when Governor
