people what is happening\nIn America the media obviously um they're driven by the dollar a day care very little about truth there's a lot of posturing a lot of politically correct posturing but when it comes to things like this are not only don't they care they often\nActively look the other way and I and I think that we as parents and community leaders have to take our young people\nTo see this in an absolutely vital that we show them what is happening in nice it's American let them know that it's up to you to do something about this that this cannot continue and the fact that he continued as long as it did how many years was was he operating his house of horrors this guy's now\nWhat's Thirty years I mean basically Thirty years he was he he you know when he's operating within ... and we know that several of those years several chain of those years no one expected the clinic no one of the department of health\nDecided to to to see you know to do that and that's interesting just what you were saying there Eric you know but people need to know what's going on in the country I mean one of the parts of the film that we you know where most proud of what they think is really important that we only for the ... were very\nVery clear we wanted to have it in the screenplay was you know that during the actual trial of climate God's will you know to abortion doctors were brought in because they needed to explain\nTo the jury what a good portion good legal abortion laws so that they could distinguish between bass and murder\n'em and I can tell you I I I've friends of mine who are medical who are in the medical profession that doctors who who commented on that particular effects but the movie of educational to them as learn they learn something they didn't know before one dear friend of mine is the next it's a\nVery highly qualified to work all over the United states of America get knocked no\nSo this is why exactly what you're saying you know people get to go because they're going to get an education I mean other than if you're like law and order episode you have this you know of course your doctor on the stand being asked can you describe\nA legal abortion to the to the jury and I remember feeling the night at the very beginning of this process that whatever happened that testimony will be in the movie in the movie script 'cause it's very important to us because we believe\nNo one has ever done that before the movie I think it's a complete first\nAnd ... and and you know when to criticize it because it's it's basically stole it from the actual transcript of the trial you know it wasn't you know what would you know rising there you know um and it was so important um to include that because\n... you know we don't have you were where else are you going to get that information it's such an unbiased and on you know on varnish way and I think it's ... it's quite shocking for people who hear it even people who think they know a good subject there'll be quite shocked to hear that ...\nOne thing we probably haven't said because we know the subject so well and certainly both of you do but but\nGod's nails did that makes them a serial killer or it's not just of course that he's doing very late term abortions which are gruesome but\nUnfortunately quite legal in America but he was also because he made a lot of money off of ah killing children who were viable obviously and you describe a described that early on but\nBut but these children would often be born alive and he would he would murdered them uh and and that is really why he is behind bars is it not\nYeah yeah I mean is he he he murdered babies born alive he he murdered his own patients by the way a by allowing on registered unqualified stop to get the ...\nAnd he also operated up go low\nUm you know he he's serving life and just for selling opioids he also did eating eating the the the legal limit for abortion and in Pennsylvania is an incredible twenty four weeks an incredible twenty four weeks like you know six months she was six months pregnant ...\nHowever that wasn't good enough for him he did even earlier than that uh during the week and then\nOn the week on the Sunday\nIt abortions solely at that he didn't trust any of the other members of style to a system to him and his wife did what he called the special kids as if he was doing twenty four plus during the week what would you do in the weekend you know nine months and months nine months and that's that's what he was on\nAny new nobody would prosecute him he was quite confident that he could get away with this obviously with the with the with the liberal abortion climate in America and especially in Pennsylvania\nAnd he was white with right because we know and we knew he was right because we know despite multiple complaints and lots of lots of complaints and in fact they all you know get complaints came to light during the grand jury investigation you know I get\nAll of the matter how bad things got and obviously I mean it doesn't get much worse than to women dying noticing what inspired the department of health and Pennsylvania to inspect the clinic and you know that's a neutral reasons why people need to go and see the movie\nIf this can happen in Pennsylvania they century not in some backwater ... century now back in the dark ages because now it's been happening now

but the clothes on their backs but their families intact there together they're alive\nUm that really uh it it it brings us all together because it it it just shows again how fleeting many so many things are\nA back if we can get together and help one another uh this is going to be a a there's going to be some light at the end of the tunnel for these folks undergone a just a terrible devastation\nWe now have six people officially dead than we have three hundred people missing and this was the most powerful storms ever hit the Florida Panhandle\nAnd modern recorded history and utility companies are now saying that ah from Florida all the way to Virginia\nAs of late last night Michel had left one and a half million people without power and of course ah as of yesterday late yesterday was a tropical storm I headed out across a um uh the\nBugs in Carolina and Virginia area back out into the ocean a maximum sustained winds of fifty miles an hour so still dangerous dumped a whole bunch of rain in North Carolina\nJust six inches of rain they've had some mud slides up in the mountains anyway hold I found when we come back we're going to get back in just in a mainstream news but Michael is still left it's gone but not\nFor God so now the rescue\nAnd recovery starts three hundred people missing as we speak right now\nI shall return don't go anywhere [noise] hey Kevin jak and you're listening to the essence of America third watch [noise]\n\nLesson here is that where\nAnd Death Valley this week the in the state will thing breathes air game to our house is another

for a glimpse insiders foot ball\nCatch every game here on him nine twenty\nCain darn men what's our business about ... yeah air conditioning and heating new plumbing in electrical now our tax clean screen train didn't die from hundreds of home every day and\nAnd by the way have you noticed that the president's been on a television a lot more than a a and hasn't necessarily called radio because he knows he can call me anytime he wants to cause I put the word out ... nuts if that's gonna happen but you never know who's going to be flying overhead at three o'clock in the morning right now\nI wouldn't use the first time ah because we did hear from him during his campaign when he was running and uh we had the opportunity to sit down and talk with him at that time too when he first came to Tampa was very honored to have that opportunity and we may have another one here so we'll see\nUm but the fact of the matter is um he is being more and more\nAre available to the press to be doing various interviews and uh I think it has to do is winning because when you when you kind of feel pretty good about things and\nCan't tell you anything these these really lost lately\nAnd uh of course the judge Kavanaugh saying you know there there's not and by the way we need to clarify something\nJudge the ... the chief of the Supreme Court Justice John Roberts\nUm sent out the ah ah let's see how should we put this he\nHe gave the ah some of the lower judges and they the federal courts a told them they needed to investigate some of these uh I'm a I'm not calling them charges but complaints there we go ... of complaints against him for a possible uh things that we're still lingering in the system\nI'm pertaining to the women that were accusing him this that and the other ... actually vindicate him a hundred percent through the digital system you're aware of that right right right right yeah that's going on as we speak and that shouldn't be very difficult to do because again there is no proof\nNo there there was nothing there and and I'm certainly no no cooperating evidence of of any kind and\nAnd um you know but the Democrats wanted to seize on some think anything of it they could try to cause making to a big deal for the for for the midterms I think some of that as backfiring on them and you know you mentioned captain about President Trump being on television a lot more yeah that's right then\nAnd one of the things I think he's feeling better about I I just think that ... of late here showing that he is very very comfortable\nIn in in going down and talking with the reporters are having a press conference\nAnd or simply just being much more visible and I think people are watching the president and they're saying this guy is not the guy that the Democrats are painting him today he's not a crazy lunatic uh who who can who can talk about these different issues\nUh he's proving them on every day and you're right you've got great material because well the the whole wedding thing like you said\nNow we had the unemployment numbers come out and a three point seven percent where's the number we saw the jobs were created and everything is looking pretty good uh I Will say this in lieu of what's happened here in Florida in Georgia\nIn southeast Alabama up and up through the\nCarolinas there's going to be a lot more job opportunities available in the construction correct\nOh sure yeah with all the infrastructure in houses have to be rebuilt now\nSo anybody that's looking for a while I don't know a job might want to ah start thinking about where the jobs are going to be and they're obviously going to be down here in my home state in the panhandle of Florida and there's going to be a lot of uh a help wanted ads that are going to be out there I was starting probably right about now\n[laughter] well it exactly and of course so it's sort of a [noise] it's gonna be a terrible profits to begin with and especially with the death recovery but you're right after that did all the different stores\nBy like can you stick around for another segment on certainly I hold on All right folks I'm going to be right back was Kyl warns the professor of politics with a lot more and yeah the latest job numbers are telling us the Trump tax cuts are working\nNo mistake about it is hard I we're all we're right back don't go anywhere you are listening to

FEMA said that quote unfortunately and these types of things as we go through and sift through the damage ultimately those who didn't heed the warnings particularly around the Mexico beach area we will see death toll the death toll rise unfortunately\nAnd yes that's true even Rick Scott yesterday said this hurricane was an absolute monster and the damage left in his wake is still yet to be fully understood catastrophic damage everywhere\nThat's from Rick Scott and in North Carolina Governor there Roy Cooper\nSaid that six inches of rain had fallen in parts of the state triggering a mudslide and McDonald county a hundred miles west of Charlotte which of course is up in the mountains up around uh Ashville and you knew that was going to happen because of all the ground saturation of water there so that's the other things going on right now\nAnd I do know yesterday the water on forty over by Wilmington was right up to the edge or by forty didn't go over the road but it was
