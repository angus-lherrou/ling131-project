growing\nWeekday out all night radio show in the country\nUm so there you go and we're very happy to to have that out to be stowed somewhere about that another bunch of stations will let let you know all about that kind of war and a professor of politics as well as the logo hello kept that let's start with a pledge you're ready I sure am I pledge allegiance to the flag\nA United States of America\nAnd chose the republic for what is it a stands one nation\nUnder God indivisible we're liberty and\nJustice for all and we emphasize the words under God because this great country of ours was founded on Judeo Christian values and you know folks let's go there for a minute\nMany historians like to say that most of the founding fathers were agnostic or die us well this is not true because I said it many times you hear that to know the founders all you need to do is read some of the letters out there from all I don't know Alexander Hamilton uh James Madison\nJohn J just to mention a few and I've got an example of it right here crowd you want to hear this yes of course\nOkay here's a letter from Alexander Hamilton\nIt said alleging association before him to be nominated to Christian constitutional society it's object to be first to support as a Christian religion second the support of the United states\nI currently examined the evidences of the Christian religion and if I was sitting as a juror opponents authenticity I Would ... get my ... in his favor I can prove which truths and clarity as any proposition ever submitted to this man's mind a man that was a letter he sent\nTo the uh cofounder\nI'm of the first Continental Congress if they had\nUm and it's in the I'm In the archives in Washington DC but here's one from James Madison not James Madison\nWas an Episcopalian and train for the ministry he was a sponsor of the bill of rights and for president of the United states from Eighteen or Nineteen Eighteen Seventeen\nAnd back in Seventy and eighty five Jesse James Madison wrote\nWe stay the whole future of American civilization not upon the power of government far from it we have steak the future of all our political institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self government upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves to control ourselves\nTo sustain ourselves according to the ten commandments of God isn't that something\nWell that's really is and I'm obviously you know like you're talking about Judeo Christian values\nAnd it's right there and then of course the one from John J. who was a member of the continental Congress he uh went on to become our first chief justice of the U.S Supreme Court he said uh\nI Do not recollect to have had more than two conversations with atheist about their ten it's the first was I was at this large party of which several of them were of the description they spoke freely and contemptuously religion I took no part of the conversation and of course ...\nOne of them asked me if I Believe in Christ I answered that I did and I think God that I did he said the almighty will not suffer slavery and the gospels go hand in hand it cannot\nAnd will not be God Bless the United states of America from John J. the first the first Supreme Court justice that's amazing\nIt really is and I think it further lay the foundation captain that you know the United states was set up by people who realized\nThat uh that they needed to provide mechanisms by which\nUh be country good always move at the very least would move in the right moral direction it would take time to read all the wrong and it would take time to uh uh or to do away with some of these different practices but the mechanism was there and that's different than what we've seen throughout history\nNow the reason I started out that way folks just because of what happened in Pittsburgh on Saturday at that synagogue a heinous act evil to the ... degree\nBy a person who obviously a had an axe to grind ah was was just hell bent on this an anti Semite a intensified many times over and Kyle or you know a little bit more about the individual 'cause that was your homework assignments so tell us about that\n[noise] well kept and obviously you know first and foremost already been praying for the uh the families that have done this and this is such a terrible\nAnd the Jewish community all around the world because this affected everybody\nAbsolutely Benjamin Netanyahu of course a talked about this as well and so the first and foremost this is a terrible tragedy uh that never should have happened and hopefully we'll\nFind ways to make sure it never happens again and that being said yes this particular gentleman so forty six years old uh we understand 'em and there was some question about what his line of work may have been and I have found a reference\nIn a um I'm In a in a in a one article from Pittsburgh uh which uh does identify that he was evidently worked in the trucking businesses from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nUh so that's one thing and I know that you've heard some other detail is well\nWell I heard he was an independent contractor that worked as a long haul trucker which means two things either owned a truck and had at least out or he was an independent driver working on a percentage drew an owner operator but that's what that means\nRight exactly and then and then some of the social media which are does appear to be tied to him I'm On a particular social media site which is sort of known as a white version of Twitter basically that account has been taken down\nA as of now is we understand a buddy said some very heinous things of course about about Jews and what his intentions were so for his final posed had to do with saying he was quote unquote going to go in now basically\nA and so this person obviously a harbored some very very strong and hateful\nFeelings that have no place obviously in our society um\nAlso of course what's very interesting too is that according to some of his posted it appears not to be a some kind of a a a big supporter of Donald Trump\nIn fact he seems to be the opposite you know Trump global yeah this is the thing is risky together is is this person is fired hold that thought and posted be right back with more kind of war and a professor of politics do forty we're we're coming right back\nIt's in this quick break

really that Andrew Gillum had said a full\nLet's just raised by the way we are and what not to protect to present it and you see what's going to have is when they get a forty percent increase taxes in his state they are going to look elsewhere\nOut there they're not going to ban they're not going to uh you know people are going to feel that kind of very very quickly was simply because people like Andrew Gillum and the idea of a\nOh we'll just raise taxes and everybody a you know they they seem to campaign with the stuff in a vacuum in other words oh don't worry we'll just raise the numbers of all be fine and it will pay for everything but that's not how the actual market or actual people react to things it doesn't happen in a vacuum\nAnd I've got a little short interview that I'm going to play here and not miss our but then the next hour I'm going to play this little short interview about uh uh we're chasing the sand is who is drawn to send us his wife and she's a very sharp individual um she certainly a would make a tremendous first lady because ah\nSomething about Andrew Gillum have you seen his wife anywhere\nI can say that I have to be you know why I don't I don't think he's married with a good question\nI don't think she's very number one buzz so number two he might have his girlfriend or whatnot but but ... has got a working partner with him his wife's like Casey who happens to be an attorney and also was an analyst on TV out of out of a TV channel that was in Jacksonville which is where he met her\nAnd she's she's just sharper than a than a than a bright light I
