Williams wise ... how did she survived the genocide and how did she survived without William for a time\n[noise] agree we're okay I appreciate your camp they only am I to go I couldn't leave to go to America along by himself [laughter]\nAnd and I think it does work behind you know ... with with with children in their in their camp and\nI Believe a ... could because she I Hope you know whenever you have a whole\nWhen it comes at Penn\nState people but when you don't have hope that when people killing people because you know hope but they had hope something how's it going to do well in America I'm always going to\nBring them all over who should be the best she could be in the ... the ... that she was in in that camp\nAnd feel like and and lo and behold a William was able to bring them over to America and they don't they don't come over there they're very crazy\nOr what was it was true or is it it's a case of truth is stranger than fiction that's for sure now in the context of this story and these characters looked as beautifully broken me\nA story of reconciliation will give you any hope\nAll that stuff you know people were broken but somehow got in there that live around and uh\nAnd they get the cops come out of out of their daughter that would be the Republican you though about broke and people who live around by costly\nSo as an actor what was it like playing a real life person in William and did it change how you approached the role in any way\nBack to my parents are the natural meat goofball totally yeah I met her on a\nLock I laugh make people laugh is crazy you know we yeah he's a man who they operate on Oprah they call me if\nI get my humble guy like the guy in there to play him and be able to you guys thought of you know but it was for it\nTo everything that I could to play him and the movie ... ... was from a range of emotions that [noise]\nThat play into it with a big challenge for me but God is good you know I was able to put it off\nSo when it comes to you and William are there any parallels in your lives [noise]\nAh yes yes what happened to him you know I may not in the camp when you went to Kenya I'm Dan does that mean bad it can do it now the wife was left the cap and now all they had to communicate your writing letters to each other and all that that\nThat actually what happened to me when I came to America by Moscow for a whole year\nAnd all we had with lettuce\nAnd police dead my we have the letter that we used to write to each other you know and um my way out of bed and all like over fifty of them you know right now so\nThat goes up the car that I could see that we would kind of went to the food from clay him in the bucket was like oh wait a minute this is that can be like to do that [laughter]\nYeah so Benjamin what can the audiences expect to experience when they want your film beautifully broken\n[laughter] I like\nHim who tore alive [laughter] no I Want to go to the ... how would die if you can make it\nGod can turn the choice [laughter] which which whatever it is [noise] because here we had\nAn old story about you know somebody was being trouble that the white America have been troubled health issues last physically go walk\nUp truck because you're picking a pact that was not even you know they should you should have taken a year but then we'll all be picked\nEverybody who Springer here and this is a an odd situation\nJohn Cox I Am not in my studio\nThat is the irony so he he is manning that word is allowable for these days use ma'am ing the\nHome studio I Wish I were there with him in person but it doesn't matter if it's what matters is that we're having a bomb he is again with the Republican candidate for governor of one of the most left wing states in the United states of America California\nAnd you would think ... if you use a pretty quixotic task to to do that and get that told me John Cox walk to the polls show right\nNow while they're showing them surging ... and by the way you have a very nice chair here ah Dennis I really appreciate that you know it's a\nGreat company [noise] I\nI Love your per se [laughter] right [laughter]\nBut hurry back\nUh you know listen uh the the the polls are surging a we've cut the lead or that he has and you know California is typically are people that make up their mind in the last couple of weeks or so you go back to eighty two was du ... coming from behind a Pete Wilson in Nineteen Ninety four came from behind\nAgainst Kathleen Brown or you know\nOur message is getting out to this day there's unaffordable for people of the housing crisis the gasoline prices the water crisis uh schools that are forty seventh\nAnd the nation roads full of potholes and congestion yet we still have money to spend all your and your even mentioned the homeless and the homeless the tragedy\nThat's going on in our cities they they are but we have plenty of money for a train that has been a served three people that is hopelessly over budget and behind schedule or you know this state you just run down the list is hard to believe that Gavin Newsom is even competitive\nGiven the results in this state but because the interest groups have spent a a literal fortune on\nHim giving him all kinds of money from Wall to wall TV ad that's what's uh putting you know Aaron under his wings but I think that's going to come down to earth and the last couple of weeks people gonna realize they really want some change here\nPerfect is and this is what's disconcerting you can't really get to vote more to the left of Gavin Newsom his wife and I never I never picked on wives but she went public with this\nShe picks up her dog droppings we've a Trump poop bag\nChi chi put that on on Twitter she's proud of the fact that she she uses the president of the United states image for dark fecal matter this this is the this is the new system that is roaming but all the the wife of the news\nBut this is all political theater down is you know and of course you know that gets attention meanwhile our kids you know a half of our public school children are reading the grade level okay ah with you as you say we've got homeless on the street I've talked\nTo business people in Los Angeles and they tell me they are afraid to walk the sidewalks you go to San Francisco and you needed ... to figure out where the human waste is and uh you know you've got people that are just lying there on the ground then of course their answer only is free needles and injection center [noise] you've got\nAll these real endemic problems\nOn top of this they're telling us you know we live next to the largest body of water in in the world the Pacific ocean but they're telling us in three years we're going to be limited to half\nThe water that we've been used to uh we're not going to take a bath in the state these are huge huge issues and I I get the the the ... bag with the president's picture on it but it's all theater we've got to get back to really giving I'll usually pull I only\nMentioned that because I think that's actually ... their ... over the moral state of the left and the uh ... I agree with it yeah so let me talk to you about the water issue so are you advocating a de ... process in in California\nPart of it there's a book called there shall be water by sets ego which uh out yeah that's right and\nI it outlines how Israel turned a desert into a wonderful agricultural and and by the way they Israel needed to do it it was a national security issue for them that they could give their imports cut off any moment and they had to grow their own food\nLike I tell ya we need to be able to grow our own food in California as well I mean obviously we have imports are that are available now but if we get into a war or\nYou know California is ah the producer of most of the nuts and fruits and vegetables for the entire country and in many parts of the world to and you know that's a function of having water and we also need water to live in and\nTake a bath and you you have to you didn't have to add fruits and vegetables you just could have said was the producer of most of the mill [laughter] that's that would have been a double entendre you I understand yes exactly by the way I I this is going to sound a little off to you but it's a I my listeners knowing serious\nThe very fact that you would advocate ... sell them as a nation would be reason enough to vote for you\nWhen when I think of what is being spent on the train to nowhere yeah I've met we could be the sale of moving water we have as you pointed out the biggest body of water on earth the entire length of this gigantic state called California and I were told that we're ... we're going to have to\nA curb our behaving in showering\nAnd people were male transforming their lawns into rock gardens [laughter]\nIt's it's a disgrace and it's also created almost a third world in the Central Valley I mean there are so many people in the Central Valley that depend\nUpon an agricultural and water for their very livelihoods and living you know what I mean the other people in Silicon valley God love them uh uh doing wonderfully but you look in the Central Valley in Victor Davis Hanson is written about this very well uh yeah it's almost a third\nWorld has some of those spots and uh\nThey're being starved of water and I got to tell them I I've been with so many farmers in this race so far who are just scared to death\nOf Gavin Newsom as governor or because they think they're going to their days will be number\n... I think that's true actually I'm I'm ... I'm a\n... a symbol of your campaigns that built the smelt [laughter]\nNo you know the simple in my campaign is somebody sitting in their car for two hours on a ... a\nLos Angeles or Orange County highway burning gasoline at four dollars a gallon muttering under their breath as they go over another pot hall and you know blow a tire or something like that\nAn insane to themselves why I Love the weather I Love of what's going on\nAnd you know with the natural beauty of this ... I get to look at the ocean every once in a while but you know is it really worth it I'm living in a cracker box apartment paying Fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars a month or\nThe rent just went up two hundred dollars a month last month and what am I going to do and you know when my kids get older and they're done with school\nWhere am I gonna live and retire I my kids going to be able to live here to begin with or where am I going to live and retire\nThese are the issues that people are thinking about Dennis and I'm hoping between now and November sixth they really hit home and people start thinking\nWe got to change this we can't continue the same path Gavin Newsom was going to make this worse\nYeah ... exactly right\nAnd what is your website contacts for governor dot com\nAnd people could contribute there obviously we've got a lot of people have done that Dennis and I think there are people in this state you know some people tell me well in order to change we just have to go over the edge you know I mean we just have to have a crisis in this state but you know what I don't want to get to that point\nDo you get what we have a crisis in this day while we do want what does that mean we have to say the middle class is leaving California I Know\nWho are there are ... miles of homeless people I mean what what what crisis or they are they talking about do we do we need to lose all electric power I mean I don't even understand that's what I mean I think it's like the ... were like the frog that's being boil them doesn't know what\nYou're absolutely right you know and you're right that the favor of the rolling blackouts that occurred back a couple of decades ago or so\nYou know these people could see that are of course they felt that and that but a valley this last week where they actually had the power turned off a in part of that is because the forests aren't being manage the utilities aren't being punished but that's another story so maybe you're right maybe this is heading home to people and maybe they're going to realize that by November sex\nYou have a special message to Hispanics\nIn California absolutely uh\nYou know they're being put upon as much worse than anybody else the the cost of housing the cost of gasoline and all the cost of living in this day and the lack of opportunity Dennis I Hope we get a chance\nThe course of the next couple of weeks to talk about that because my opponent was putting business by Gordon Getty and the billionaires in San Francisco I struggled I had to work my way up from the bottom I think that's a message for or Hispanic population the says you know we need to make sure that people have more opportunity in this state\nAll right listen tell me again the name of the website John talks for governor dot com [noise] All right my friend will talk again thank you very very important that is Prager every body John Cox Republican governor I'm telling you\nIntentions are important and every one's intentions during sex should be of care healing and relief not of personal appetite and blind conquest every one's intentions should be care yelling and relief\n\nA social worker nodded they not ... not a husband every every every intention during sex should be care healing and relief bottom personal appetite what planet you live on\nGod that's that I got to tell you as a man I could see how I could see how her partner would just be he would be so turned on by by only thinking of care feeling of relief during sex\nTheir children their children\nThe last ... that's that's like ... like in the ah the Milwaukee school I open up the show with the they're they're banning um\nWhat is the plague and uh to kill a mocking bird [laughter] I I I just ...
