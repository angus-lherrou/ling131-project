course it's a very very important part of the president's job or whoever the president is when you have these kinds of natural disasters or to go and actually see for themselves what is actually happening on the ground I think it goes a very long way not only to showing\nTheir own personal commitment to these kinds of tragedy uh about of course it gives the people that I think a real boost to know that their front and center on them in the eyes of the nation\nWell just to give you the commitment of our governor Rick Scott he has pulled himself off the campaign trail he's not going to be doing any more campaigning right up until the election because of the importance of what needs to be done right now with the rescue and recovery work\nUh up there in the panhandle in our seven four to counties that have been directly affected and instead to his wife am\nI'm is going to be out of the campaign trail uh subbing for him so that's how important this is to get this uh taking care of and done right to the governor will shine the governor will absolutely flat out shy and oh by the way do you remember the discussion we had and I told you that wasn't going to happen when Andrew Gillum sudden you're all\nGoing to have your power on by Monday you\nRemember that yeah ... how many people you think don't have their power on where he told them they would probably a vast majority about one third wow mhm\nYeah so don't make promises you can't keep because it makes you looked like a dam pool\nThat's true that's true there's so many variables in these situations and that's why you got a power cruise everybody's working so hard to get everything done and yet sometimes you have to realize that it takes as long as it takes and nobody said nobody's saying you know the slack and one of the John everybody's working very hard\nNo no I'm going to switch over here to something different a project Vera ... was alive and well again doing a little off\nOff the record they're recording of Claire McCaskill Senator Claire McCaskill I'm not sure exactly if this was that or a rally a sit down table\nHow this was but she was carrying on a conversation with somebody who had a camera and she absolutely spill the beans about her personal agenda and ah the personal things that she didn't want people to know about Jesus people just can't do that\nTalking about these semi automatic rifle ban and do other things were going up plus her personal agenda and ah I'm telling you the people in Missouri that are listening to me right now uh I if you have seen this or if you have a ... it's out there and the Internet right now I just won't cost her the election in my opinion\nI think you're absolutely right about that and certainly in Missouri I think is known as the show me state and what she showed of course was\nA you know what's really going on a behind the mask behind the curtain and we have seen the ...\nAnd played out also recently in the cabinet hearings were seeing exactly what Democrats or or thinking what they're capable of doing what they're what they're actually coming out and saying and when you have things or when the ideas that will people can't do this or that\nAnd they they shouldn't notice about our agenda until after you know the election is done those kinds of things um are extremely damaging because what it does is it is that we enforce the idea that you have a group of people who believe they are truly are debtors\nAnd they're the ones who are going to determine what the people can and cannot do\nThis is in direct opposition kept into\nReal conservative and that says look you know people have to be responsible we're not going to simply tried to tell everybody what to do and this kind of thing but we're going to create a society where we all work together but we have personal responsibility that's a whole different animal from what she said well from what she was sort of projecting their\nWell yeah and of course tell the people one thing and then hope for another and a union and meantime you're hiding your whole solution or you know what's your what's your agenda was to begin with and this is just a\nThis is just unbelievable uh I'm trying to pull up this a video here as we speak\nUp because she talked about she says people just can't know that uh her agenda including semi automatic rifle ban um moderate voters would see could hurt her ability to get elected and let me see if I can pull this up here 'cause I'm working on right now here\nAll right let me see what happens here is trying to shift this works\nI can tell them because she does the door to\nSomebody automatic fire [noise]\n'cause I Want to take the medicines semi automatic like semi automatic\nMore so which is where\nAll\nThe modern\n\nAnd he's been hammering at all\n\nI Know that person that was just interviewed was the campaign manager preterm McCaskill\nRight in saying that people would just have to get over\nThe idea after they drop the impeachment hold that thought those should be right back with Tyler Ward is professor politics amazing\nDeception buddy this was a cabinet members of the six am the night so they'll\nBe talking about on this radio station was American Idol was conservative God\nPat Boone here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product\nNot until now not until released factor came

to aging exercise\nAnd everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night or keeping you from taking those nice long walks or playing golf for tennis you can't really call it living if you\nCan't get around comfortably a three week quick start from relief factor maybe all you need to lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to release factor dot com and here's something\nYou need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start now only Nineteen Ninety five and go on to order Morse\nLet's see if we can get you out of paying to go to relieve factor dot com\nTell well his lawyer has lawyers already said that he's going to plead the fifth on Capitol Hill where Jamie is the same thing as saying you're guilty\nWell well it's certainly in this case now everybody has that the constitutional right as we know that the weight or you can self incriminate basically\nA but it looks very very bad given this given the circumstances and um you know from what we know about all of this stuff like a one would think that if there's there's nothing there there's no there there and he would be able to sort of explain this certainly with the advice of his counsel no doubt\nI think they already know the answers to questions they're asking and I think it just by him not saying anything uh giving the answer is I think that's going to create more of a problem for him and for his fusion GPS and just a finance the case\nSo it's there of course Mr Mueller and his team we really don't know exactly what they're doing but they keep they keep ... around like a ship on a on a on a I'm a vase of course to get away from torpedoes\n[laughter] right right well I think there's there's something building cat and I think there's something building in terms of\nWhere all this is going to sort of play out and and that's going to be vindicated yeah I think to President Trump and ah because there was no collusion with Russia et cetera et cetera et cetera\nAnd when this all sort of a panned out and I think you're going to the uh people sort of scattering on the left because there won't be any way to to spin it their way anymore and the American people are going to see that\nAnd the and the and that's going to drive and even if it's going to create an even bigger blow to the Democratic party\nNow
