dedicated people from all around the United states including Canada\nAnd Puerto Rico that were there and the hurricane zone working to try to help those people as best as they could to get things back to some sort of resembled normality which will take\nThe better part of a year in my opinion and don't forget to check out the captain's America's third watch dot com website the captain's America third watched dot com by joining us right now kind of war and a professor of politics they call\nIt captain let's say the pledge you get going rate I sure am I pledge allegiance is to do with why I like a United States of America and choose the republic for which stands\nOne nation under God indivisible where literally\nAnd justice for all we emphasize the two words under God this great country of ours was founded on Judeo Christian values well Kyle the big story over the weekend is a day he said she said stuff over this a\nWashington Post American citizen reporter who went missing when he went inside the Saudi Arabia in Turkey never to be seen from again and Saudi Arabia has warned that it will respond\nAgainst any threats or as their stock market plunged last week following Donald Trump's warning of severe punishment over the disappearance of that reporter\nThat's exactly right kept in a the Saudis are using the term is a vital role in the global economy in terms of what the canoes economy the kind of influence they they believe they have of course not having to do with oil and the price of oil this kind of thing uh but what's been going on of course\nAnd even the president himself in the recent interview with CBS I Believe\nI'm saying look into this could have some pretty big uh repercussions basically based on what we find out\nAnd in the meantime captain you got twenty two US Senators\nI'm already but they have done they have triggered a provision of what's called the global Magnitsky human rights accountability act\nWhich means and automatic investigation into what it's been reported on this uh alleged killing 'em and ah the results of ... century the idea that this is\nPerhaps moving to some kind of critical mass could have a massive effect on us Saudi relations\nWell it also had something to do with the release of the pastor\nA Andrew Brunson or over the weekend too because a Turkish officials say they fear Saudi agents chills and dismembered this reporter after ... under the consulate saying that\nThey have audio and video recordings of it but they've not yet released it and of course the Saudi kingdom is called the allegations basic baseless and said that there is no evidence that the writer ever left the confidence or the constant rather they're not a of said what happened to him\nBy trade what alleged to have happen again these are just according to the report that we have so far is that something as you mentioned yet the body would have been dismembered and actually brought back to Saudi Arabia\nA in smaller uh cases as it were a bit of course was also going on as we're seeing sort of an exodus of a lot of uh of media of from an upcoming conference and Saudi Arabia and essentially what's called down to thirty vision twenty thirty calm grant\nA so far I think that's businesses are still on hand ah but one of the things that the Saudis really want to do is they want to push this idea that they are reforming very well not reforming but they're expanding their economy uh they're modernizing if for the for the rest of the twenty first century this kind of thing\nAnd this could be a major PR blow to them something they don't want to suffer a at this juncture but it certainly they said massive massive effect on us Saudi relations could ensue uh because of course and there's this big order for military equipment on on hand right now\nPresident Trump themselves even said he doesn't want to necessarily uh put the put the kibosh on that right now because it means jobs and income and this kind of stuff\nBut uh there's going to be a major reckoning if it turned out to be true\n[noise] that's true and folks are speaking to warn professor of politics and or a car so as Saudi Arabia goes and uh as the flow of oil goes so goes the or\nThe world in general and of course that's what they're talking about because as we as things stand right now ah and I'm going to refresh this because when we started the show everything was in the red when it came to the market and it's still in the ... the NASDAQ down forty three points as as some pie is down\nA few chooses down ten points and the Dow futures are down Ninety eight points and\nApparently that's setting up for what could be an interesting Monday at the market\nNow that's that's for sure and of course you're Saudi relations go uh I think it's I think it's important that the current leadership of course of Saudi Arabia\nAnd remembers of course the major role that the U.S and the allies played in stopping Saddam Hussein way back in the early nineties for example\nUm but it also of course they believe that they can create a global impact with by the price of oil and this just goes to show why it's so important for energy independence for the United states of America\nAfter he took her away after they invaded and took control to Kuwait over the argument over the oil the next prize was Saudi Arabia and the oil fields and they definitely were going to head in that direction had not been for the major presidents of the U.S staging in Saudi Arabia getting ready to uh\nUh invade Kuwait and Dr ... Iraq back out of their\nExactly you know I I Would hope kept it in the end of course there are things will be able to be amended in some way but obviously when you have a reporter and President Trump themselves even emphasize the very fact that it was a reporter that has evidently been killed in this in this fashion\nUh that it sends the obviously such a terrible terrible signal to the rest of the world uh so I don't think that uh it's gonna be able to be swept under the rug too quickly obviously because the president himself is out there I think they're heading this whole\nI don't mean miles the president is headed down here to Florida in Georgia for either a mature France today tomorrow or whatnot 'cause Wednesday he'll be out west but he will be down here one of those days to survey the hurricane damage on me tell you something it is it is devastating for sure\nIt certainly is what I've seen on television is just terrible this force firsthand up close and personal okay hold that thought guile we'll be right back with more with coyote warned a professor of politics\nAnd uh yeah I'll tell you a little bit about what we did over the weekend of what I saw was people need a up there because this as devastating as the other state for years\nAnd now they they really are seeing that you know this was going to be the pattern moving forward and they put President Trump in the oval office for a specific reason and that was to actually change things and to ah to stand up to so much of the of the far left in this country or the or the Democratic leader agenda\nAnd yes the Democrats are energized yes they're angry I actually heard one Democrat a person I Want to Sunday shows today saying that they thought that Hillary ... I'm I'm you know there's a speaking about being an civil was sort of the right way to go and all that which is shocking\nIt's just shocking ah so yes they are energized but they're energized for all the wrong reasons and but yet I think the Republicans got energized as well too and I think they're going to show up at the polls in a big way\nWhile they are and they get in here is the one thing that contradicts this poll because it's in the poll fewer registered voters say they would rather see Democrats win control of the house to act as a check on Trump that number and August was sixty percent now it's down to fifty four percent\nWhich tells me that more people are not going to vote to replace Congress they're going to vote for the better candidate which is the way they should vote and they're going to vote for anybody that's been doing the job to help the economy and things pick up the way that they have been such a manner that you can now be a feeling pretty good about what's going on in America\nBut what exactly and and and the consequence of a Democrat house\nSenate still looks to be pretty good in terms of how the Republicans are going to fare but in terms of the house what people I think don't want to vote for is to vote for for example Maxine Waters in charge of some committee you know supporting documents\nA you know and running endless investigation them and talking about impeachment and all this kind of thing I think that people are saying themselves you know this is a hunting and Trump put it so well the other night in one of his rallies gone wacko [laughter] well see that\nThey do and by the way it can you stick around for ... so certainly okay good because of one of the things that rats musician put out over the weekend is that Republicans are mad or about the Kavanaugh controversies and the Democrats are and they are determined to vote in the upcoming elections because of its its two to one compared to what the Democrats are\nHere that's amazing and and that sort of you know that that's how we're supposed to effect change or have a voice or in this country is not supposed\nTo let it doesn't tell me that there's going to be any type of a blue wave or a change coming to the Democrats advantage I Do not believe it\nWell I think a lot of that if a narrative put out by some in the media who want to again give that sense of inevitability member when they hit the same thing about Hillary Clinton Ninety five\nPercent chance she was going to win at all that is to create this feeling but what you're talking about is actual practical you know data that we're looking at\nWhy hold that thought folks will be right back with more with Kyle warned a professor of politics bottom of the our break and then we'll see in the other side of the break so don't go anywhere I shall return I everybody\nThis is the captain Matt Bruce tune into the six am here tonight there'll be talking about tomorrow on this radio station the gases America Says watch American Idol was conservative God Bless America [noise] so that's\nOur and News I'm Rhonda roster of early Monday morning Sears Holdings filed for chapter ... bankruptcy buckling under its massive debt load and staggering losses the filing comes just weeks before the crucial holiday shopping season and it comes after rescue efforts have kept it out of bankruptcy court at least until now\nSaudi Arabia is threatened to retaliate for any sanctions imposed against it after President Trump made since the oil rich kingdom deserves severe punishment if it's found responsible for the disappearance and suspected murder of Washington Post contributor ...\nWho's been missing after entering the Saudi constantly in Istanbul over a week ago\nA flurry of talks between Britain and European Union ended Sunday without a bricks that agreement leaving the two sides three days to close up a gap in their positions before a make or break some it\nIs is is our and news\n\nTwenty minutes or whether overnight lows around sixty one out there with partly cloudy skies Monday mostly sunny sky high nearing eating it that looked like we have a light showers later on in the day which will take a Monday Night from the ... and ...
