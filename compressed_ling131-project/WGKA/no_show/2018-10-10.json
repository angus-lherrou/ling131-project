everything in the area and I tell you why I said this is this is not good and I got a four\nAnyway um every prayer warrior I Know\nIt's been on this but you know and I oh by the way I'm Glad they must have gotten out of it um because uh I I Know that you're near ... junior yeah that was kind of an area that worry\nI went to his father's house in Orlando yeah good for him he was living right in an area where yes that's around cedar key yeah just seeing what's going to come right hander values are that\nYeah yeah yeah that's right above us\nKind of he's got three little girls so I told them it's

north of us support during the Big Bend you're right\nYeah it's scary and gets too close but anyway I'm also is a I Know that this is our relationship if I said a lot of it is it's it's a most of these areas that were talked to that we were really\nRevealing her right now those are is on the radio\nAbsolutely and and I watch all to know you know you know now why didn't do a regular shout out tonight you're getting but anyway because we're praying them over you and also um I was at the um say she's listening a Kathy ... director of a ... big nursing home there had to move all her patients and herself right in the midst of it\nI'm a I'm God Bless you I Hope you got out of it kept the okay 'cause I Know when you handle when you're in charge of a lot of\nPeople that there's nothing I Can't even imagine\nI Know I've had him or move a nursing home before when there was a collection of snowstorm\nAnd you know how how they are kept you know there are a lot of them and they're ill and\nWow it is just something but my heart goes out there there wouldn't be enough if I read the whole Bible the guy that wouldn't it would not make a difference\nBecause you're in it you know it although it does help to know that that God is there to protect and comfort you that that is important I shouldn't say it doesn't matter because I'm a I definitely believe in God's word I stand by in fact uh I probably wouldn't have made it till now if not in fact I hear some rain starting now it's like oh\nWell we're going to have bands come and go but go ahead\nYeah we had a bad when I say let me let me just quote a couple of things that could help because you know way back during the day to day I didn't know that they even had those things but um [noise]\nGod is our reputation drink a very present helping trouble we will not fear though the earth the removed by almost happening it feels like into the mountains they carried in the midst of the sea\nAnd if the water's roar and they are and be trouble and the mountain shake with the swelling there ah gotcha helper\nAnd the and the lord opposes whether he said you know that I Am God you know it's very hard to to repeat these words when you're in the midst of a storm just like if I'm In the midst of a serious problem\nI you know it's very hard I could read these words but I'm saying but by God you know the three of them together here you know I'm In the midst of this what am I supposed to do well you know I I I tell people on my phone lines 'cause a lot of you know I Do a lot most of my work is on my phone line prayer where\nI Am very honest with people I Do not understand why tragedies have to happen at certain areas and one of ... although we've always had hurricanes seems like they're getting bigger and bigger\nI don't understand why good people have to go through it but I Do know that you know a thousand ... site and by that whatever at the right it do it I Believe this I with all my heart if you have faith if if you believe in God not your time to go\nI'm telling you I think people come out the worst disasters and really rebuild their life and they're better for it I Know you think I'm making that up I promise you I'm not I'm old enough to say that I've seen it\nAll voting here that absolutely [laughter] ... yeah captain I Will vouch for the absolutely\nYou know it's ... it's how we react during it and we are just here to um a B the prayer people that stand behind you and you need to know that that you all you\nKnow the angels are so very very dear to me 'cause God that he would give his angels charge to watch to keep\nTo keep it said on her way that the charge guy gave you are so especially the people who have faith is it important yes it is\nNever never never can anyone no demon and how could take my faith away because you know that's all we have and and when I've been through the worst that I had been through some things that they're unbelievable and and it was very hard for me to lift my head you know I I tell you the truth but I said but the lord on high and mighty or\nYou know I'm Ninety three says the floods have lifted up their voice than their wave but the lord on high is mightier than the noise the many waters or\nThe wave of the sea what does that mean is it going to stop it no but God will keep you safe through it that that his promise and I I Believe in his promises and do can we come out better and rebuild a absolutely it\nHappens a lot uh I expect the Carolinas eventually will come out when it's right we go where you don't go to\nKnow because it's so this is headed towards our on I just wanted to ... yeah\nThat's right and I I about fell over what I heard that when I did I knew and I ... a captain's right just listen to him go go as far away that you can get but anyway I just watch all to know every prayer I lawyer that I Know and I'm not talking about people just saying we're going to pray you know that that doesn't do it\nPeople that are giving up even fasting right now for you well I I'm not ...
