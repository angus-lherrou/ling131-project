[noise] because\nHere we had an old story about you know somebody would be a couple of white America have been troubled law [laughter] go go one [laughter]\nYou're picking up that we're not even you know they should have taken a year but then we'll all be could be ...\nYou know so that's what I was like the audience gets spread\nBenjamin it's been a tremendous pleasure having you most of the TV Time machine feel free to join us in the future for the sake of land and [noise]\nThe advent of western civilization on this continent [noise] maybe it's not a celebration of the man specifically [noise] that's why the rap represents [noise]\nThe antipathy to western civilization is the is the issue the issue in the\nWorld today the west has Brett a generation that has contempt for itself\n\nRight that's what it amounts to that's the battle over Columbus state the it's not one's attitude to indigenous people that it's not one's attitudes Christopher Columbus is not the ... that the various early settlers engaged in which they did I like to remind\nPeople that you judge people in the age they lived\nMy commentary second volume of my five volume commentary on the first five volumes\nOf the Bible is coming out next year and in the spring I Am finishing genesis right now and one of the grape brilliant typically brilliant lines is that no one God saved I'm only ... and his family from the flood\nWas a righteous man in his generations but doesn't say was a righteous man in his generation that's a warning\nYou don't judge people by the standards of your generation you must judge people by the standards of their generation\n\nOr right just ... it's it's called the wisdom and I've even get I didn't make that up\nI learned wisdom because I went to religious school where I was taught that three thousand year old texts had great wisdom more\nAmazingly even even the New York times editorial page [noise] that\nIs one heretical state but\nYou know that a man called me last hour and said that if\nIf he were falsely accused of rape and the entire nation knew what it would not in any way hurt his reputation\nWe should keep that that's a hall of fame coal\n\nThey use this is where I'd like to interview the person you know I don't ... don't curse I don't know the little I just I'm puzzled it's just puzzled how people could say things that are that are so obviously not true\nOut of the mind go there\nFor the so Brett Kavanaugh is in there by the way I heard today's he's been installed and apparently\nThe Lena Kagan was present at the swearing in were you aware of that and I believe Ruth Bader Ginsburg went as well\nI guess there are ... those two a liberal women on the Supreme Court\nIncidentally [laughter] so typical [laughter] oh he can be a good justice because he attacked the Democrats in the uh in his hearing because there there was no reason to attack the Democrats as we know they they\nThey were running a fine shift their Lindsey Graham who is you know who is is bridge building a Republican is exists\nI should play it again I should play that periodically for the next year to remind people that's how good he was\nAnyway people forget you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg gave a speech which she attack Donald Trump ... justice\nAnd Indian means nothing it means nothing like it didn't happen\nSo if he's invalidated for attacking the Democrats in the Senate why isn't she invalidated for attacking the president of the United states while she's sitting justice because the same rules\nDon't hold for both sides that's why maybe\nWe should a senator Hirono of Hawaii who wish she interviewed by where where is taking place on state of the union Dana Bash interviewing the senator from Hawaii\nWho is one of the uh more uh well it's not true they're all equally left okay let's let's hear this this is priceless\nAnd Republican what they're saying is fat\nDemocratic protesters quote an angry mob and wouldn't want to ask you about it you know one thing to laugh and laugh at the Capitol that's been done for for example race and frankly some of the country\nIt's another thing to run senator out of restaurants go to their home is that going too far I think that a court ruled\nThat there are a lot of people who are very very much I'm motivated about what is going on because OK okay\nThat if that does not disqualify this woman from serious moral consideration nothing to\nDo do you do you think that Republican senators seeing right wing mobs go into restaurants and start screaming and cursing at at at democratic officials you think they would say well it just shows people are motivated\n\nThe witness stand the moral rot at the heart of the left this is this you say every day I bring you an example I'd like to know how any of you on the left not liberals liberals just are naive\nBut leftists are truly damaging but so I I just want to know\n\nWhat why do you how to you\nAssimilate into your conscience what the scent this democratic senator has said\nHow do you feel about these people who go into restaurants and start screaming\nAt a at a Republican senator for example like they did with Ted Cruz a fellow senator see I'm torn right now\nCan I what I advocate on the air that people do to senator her role in a while was dumped a Senator Cruz\nSee I Can't do that because I have standards but I I Am curious how she what she would say if it happened to her\nAfter all I Know this is amazing to Democrats we feel as passionately as you do I know you you can't believe that because we're so much more simple than you so you don't really believe that we feel is passionately about things as you do\nBut we rain in our\nBehavior because we're conservative and we wish to conserve standards like good old middle class Nineteen fifties standards that too which you are trained to answer\nYour ... do well includes Jim Crow\n\nYou think that the were advocating Jim Crow\n\n... business selling my body that advocates the idea that you don't serve a black person\nEpisode a film oh my\nYes you have to believe that\n[noise] continue with senator Hirono plays\nA lot I'm motivated by what is going on because what might happen if I have an I ... got a fair prosecutor are up in the federal ... after that the why ... why why they ... at that before we don't want to hear\nFrom you know what happened here and what kind of rank row hearing about going out with no ... this is what happens now okay run your life for ...\nMatter of fact I mean\nLike in our country this ten minutes to vice everywhere in our country that are kind of a ... he probably down to perform all my life I live in ... for that\nRight well but boy is it a violation of the law go screaming at a restaurant is is there is a disturbing the peace is a trust passing I I'm just interested in question I don't know I don't know\nAny way the white supremacist but she's she's on the left you just showed throw up the word white supremacist\nAfter Ohio how you're going to a [noise] convince blacks than they mean Democrats who have all made some damage to the [noise] the settlement should shut up [noise] [noise] [noise] not if you're a Democrat and\nYou're a left wing man you should be told me this is our country\nUh there's no way for any of us to know the truth but in America when there is no evidence to support something from thirty six years ago\nWe do not deprive a man of his livelihood that is that is the uh we did not you know we do not presume that the man is guilty or the woman for that matter\nA but it may not help it meant you used to probably still be called look if if I thought you were massages when you said good morning I guess there's no hope for you\n[laughter] don't say by friend [noise]\nThank you very much and thank you very much or by the way my a P has ceased functioning gentleman so I cannot put this why is this connected wherever you go this happens so often and you wonder what year it really is in terms of technology\nSo very a very painful thing but you want to know painful oh boy well I talk to you by the way there was a guy who knew about limos who was who gave up he was on the line from Florida I wanted to take his call\nFolks I I I totally understand if you hang up if you're not taking you know within twenty minutes or so or totally get it\nBut it's not good to coal thinking that you will be taken within twenty minutes that just it's not easy for me\nThat a lot of calls and a lot to say aside from coals but anyway I just wanted to do what I was very curious about the uh I Am a I Am heartbroken about this accident upstate New York heartbroken\nAnd to learn that was a two thousand and one car two thousand one and they send that out as a limo and it didn't pass inspection and you said that I was a limit when the guy doesn't have a license to drive a limo and you send him out to dry and she tweets this thing is falling apart before she dies four daughters\n\nI'll tell you you are just one more word on this because I Can't get this but I Can't get this out of my mind so painful or think of the parents of the four daughters\nWhat what a sustaining them what will sustain them I Believe I mean among other things is that they I think I think some of them have children you know you know if that's true or they too young to have children because of thirtieth birthday party one just got married\nThis is\nThe youngest was the thirty year old so I guess you don't think we'll just they'll have grandchildren to take care of them say this is what I mean you just don't know every day that's good what is you know my uh you know my motto if nothing's horrific life is terrific\nThat's ah but now you know why I say that\n... ah right Scott
