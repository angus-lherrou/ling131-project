to the republic for what you're saying and one nation under God indivisible where to liberty and justice\nFor all and we emphasize you course ladies and gentleman that great of the phrase\nUnder God because that means that our country was founded on Judeo Christian values real Kyle we're going to cut right to the chase and get right to the caravan per se and I'm going to start out with something the president said here here's thirty nine seconds of President Trump\nNow is you know Mexico is on their southern border their southern border\nFighting and they're finding some bad people in that group you know you see the people come up and you're listening to the fake news back there and you'd think they're all\nYou think some serious you think they're all wonderful fateful you got some bad people and those groups you got ... feet filling those goods and I'll tell you what this country does it want them\nNow no we don't want them but here's the other problem we started out talking about a thousand two thousand four thousand five thousand seven thousand\nThen we heard the number ten thousand thrown around yesterday and all night long and the ... evening programs we were hearing fourteen thousand people in this caravan\nWhat's right well by any measure we know that the caravan is growing up um and we know that for example one of one of the issues that phase of this caravan is how do you move through Mexico\nUm because there are areas of territory costs that are controlled by cartels for example in order to do so you have to be able to navigate that and um they probably believed that the larger the caravan to use your days or if they're going to be to do that\nDespite upwards of the Mexican government these kinds of things um but yeah it is um it is growing\nNow we also know that God works in mysterious ways here and all of a sudden we have a category for almost category five hurricane coming ashore sometime during the day to day\nOn the Pacific side called hurricane Wilma was one hundred and fifty five mile wins and the storm surge and all the sort of stuff we saw up here with hurricane Michael is a a little bit more intense storm\nAnd a little bit wider storm to what Michael was and this is coming right at cross cutting right in front of where are these people are are trying to get through right now what do you think that's going to do to saying\nWell this is a very very serious obviously humanitarian situation as well I'm just thinking about of course the kind of widespread damage a category five hurricane and find maybe four or three years it starts getting land obviously it'll\nStory's bad enough for his worst five is complete devastation exactly\nAnd the track that we're looking at right now put certain north of ...\nAnd and almost on the area of their minds that line so anybody who's ever taken a cruise down the Mexican Riviera knows exactly where Kabul ... at the end of Baja California market lawn across and then of course little but counters predator vibe or to\nUm so that's all going to come through you've got you've got obviously the the uh the problems are going to be associated with the hurricane hitting that goes to Mexico to begin with\nBut then you have this caravan of people who are literally unprotected they've taken only the clothes on the back in many cases and the question is one of the Mexican government going to be doing in order to try to ensure their safety now with everything\nGeorge not much because I got to take care of their citizens first before they take care of these people these refugee and these are a ... a legal is whatever you want whatever you want to call in by the way I think we'll start calling them what a lot of my listeners are telling me to this is an invasion\nWell it's being set up as in many ways as a stunt or in order to to push the issue um you have some people now some people do want to apply for asylum in the United states of America\nAnd here's the problem Kyle because Bill O'Reilly last night hit the nail on a hat on Newsmax television he was with my buddy Wayne route he said the asylum policy we have in the United states needs to be changed because of\nAll it's doing is drawing more and more illegals or cross that border in our direction\nWell that's exactly right and what a attorney general Jeff Sessions has been doing\nHas been looking at the ability of the administration to begin to redefine what an asylum seeker is all about\nAnd and of course asylum seekers refugees are pretty much the same thing but it really it depends on where they are when they make these kinds of requests and so but ... from the statutory him that going back to Nineteen eighty there are I Believe there was a\nStatute that helped define what a refugee would be and so forth and it may be very difficult for the administration to change those definitions without going back through a legislative process\nThat being said that being said uh you know the idea that you have people traveling this far thriller hurricane and mind you a begins to make you wonder uh is this something that is a legitimate or with it\nAnd for asylum why can't that be Mexico or applied to the un and they may resettled them in a different country\nAnd folks are we're coming up on the brakes here in about a minute I'm just going to change this and tell you when we come back\nFrom our break and we're going to talk to you and tell you about the open society\nFoundation and the twenty eight million dollars that they have given to various\nCharities in in terms of what's called grants are that are in Mexico but some of those charities are churches and some of those churches are in the United states in trial this is all again part of the problem we're going to name names and and throw\nThrow money out there how's that sounds good I folks will be right back because this is a big deal this is a big deal going on down there in Mexico and people are gonna die as a result of this because of this hurricane coming ashore now you got another problem I'll be right\nBack everybody this is a ... students who to six am here tonight there'll be talking about ...

yeah\nIt was a letter bomb and then so back in the day that's what that uh\nWhat's the what the whatever the guy's name laws are ... there was an a cabin up in the middle of nowhere remember the Unabomber yeah the Unabomber that's what he did\nAnd there you go and yeah Dave in Indiana it's a mess but it's a mess that we can control all we have to do is take control of our border and not let people in the think they're going to sneak in and and be whatever the asylum law has to be changed right Kyle\nWhite it definitely has to be has to be\nBeard and then all of those two is caught up with the uh with the kind of aid that countries like Salvador Honduras Guatemala receive\nWell you want to solve the problem stopped giving them money say okay until you stop this on your end not one more time\nWell that's something I think the president has actually intimated yea for this and\nThat and I live in I Believe coming up Monday there'll be something in the works to make that happen\nWell exactly because you can't you can't say send us money or send us aid continue providing aid but then also we're going to now send a bunch of people to your country which now also going to require assistance from so for home if they can't have it both\nWays and I've got to report here from something else too you know we know that they took about a hundred ISIS out the government of Guatemala actually arrested a hundred or a legend ISIS a a a a fighters you know that I've heard that had found their way over here from wherever they come from in the middle east however\nMS Thirteen is traveling in this group to\nAnd the problem of course in Salvador Thirteen and these ... you know and of course if they could if they could\nUh ensconced themselves into this caravan\nAnd believing that they're going to get entry into the U.S\nUh they're not coming because they fear or some political system in their home country but they're coming here to do crime\nThat's not talking about all of the people who are looking for a better life we're talking about those who see an opportunity and who are deliberately I mean they are criminals and and the kinds of things that we've heard about from MS chain and the documented\nCrimes and killings and execution is it's unconscionable and they should not be allowed in this country under any circumstances\nAnd you stick around for another segment certainly okay well the president has officially called alerted the border patrol and the military saying that this is a national emergency while I'm calling to move in a national emergency declaring that the United states must change the laws and that under declaring a national emergency on our nation's border southern border with Mexico we can\nPut the military down there just like we

Louisiana or almost all the way to New Orleans at will be headed their direction so let's talk about it tropical moisture is dreaming I head of the major hurricane Willa that's a category\nFor hurricane a hundred and fifty five mile an hour winds right now that's going to go ashore today in a western part of Mexico on the coastline this is going to be a major player in the scheme of things including the caravan ha a invasion because this is going to stop a dead in his tracks\nNow the western Mexico coastline is interacting with a frontal boundary along the Gulf Coast which is a in the western part of the Gulf Coast from the\nTexas border all the way up now as I said about halfway across Louisiana right there are interacting with the scattered showers all through that area along the coastline that is of\nThe Gulf now the rain will shift further east into the western and central Gulf Coast it'll get heavy there'll be flooding there'll be mudslides there'll be all kinds of stuff which is going to enter into the equation again with this caravan such ended in that direction because they are going to be able to move\nAnd they're going to be all the elements and uh God has a strange way of working sometimes but let me just tell you that job I can\nUh the rain starts out there tonight are coming out of a Florida about halfway across let's see we just wants to uh just west

collar areas is Catwoman\nYes morning how are you I'm doing fine what's up [noise] but yeah I Know one day I haven't heard anyone talk about with this invasion coming across here I'm from I don't understand that they're looking at Brownsville for landing point a weed out what the I don't\nKnow yet because there's a hurricane coming across and that's going to change everything\nRight um well what I haven't heard anything about the supply chain\nWhile the supply chain is coming from the groups that I was telling us talking about here some of them are churches very well known to the United states that have got missionaries down there and they are getting their supplies ... either given to them or it's being bought and paid for by the money just floating around those terrify engine there is money that's changing hands down there\nA lot of the like and I'm Talking about it to the U.S companies like us we haul superhero a majority of our supply chain towns from factory south of Brownsville and Mexico about the Laredo Del Rio those are the three big entry point\nFor Subaru part besides out in al Paso uh-huh and they're already we're already hearing rumbles through the company that uh uh that's very good chance that supply gave him a cut off well with the people coming across and they're going to try to re route everything\nThey could be but the the people right now are not even going to be able to get anywhere near the border are those plants could I say there's a hurricane coming and with the rain and with the wind and all that stuff they're going to be called out the elements 'cause all I can do is go backwards you can't go forward will be right in the middle of the storm\nRight and I and I ran the Mexican government is not going to take care of them\nNow now now
