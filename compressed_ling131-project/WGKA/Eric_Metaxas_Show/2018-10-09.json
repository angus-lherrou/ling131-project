R. G.\nR. A. R. MED to eight seven to two two okay back to Colin Powell for just a moment here really interesting let's wrap this up in either together what does this have to do what you're going to have everything to do with your gut\nBecause everything I just showed you that Colin Powell recited was left every bit of it was a Democrat talking point\nAnd Colin Powell is a Republican\nIn name only rhino\nColin Powell ... nothing he said there's nothing conservative in what he said\nBear in mind that after Newtown Colin Powell turned on your right to bear arms ... did he know he didn't he's never believed in your right to bear arms he believes the second amendment but\nThere is no but in the second amendment I Would argue to him that all gun control is an infringement\nAnd then I Would go right back to something David coterie is that if you can't be trusted with a firearm you shouldn't be able to be walking around what else can you be trusted with can you be trusted behind the wheel of a car if you can't be trusted the state we handle firearms you are not be walking around\n\nColin Powell has no problem restricting your right to keep and bear arms\nColin Powell is trying to reassert himself somewhere into some form of relevancy by doing this interview what I'm using this whether he is successful or not really doesn't matter because you understand where I'm going with this and this has to do this again use Colin Powell as a reminder\nThat these people who claim to be done and folks or conservatives are anything but\nThey are not\nAnyone who has no problem giving tax dollars away your money away to people who are in this country illegally cannot be trusted to uphold your right to bear arms\nAnybody who claims they support the second amendment but does not support the second amendment and they do not support your right to keep and bear arms they cannot be trusted\nAnyone who spit left wing talking points about Donald Trump cannot be trusted to protect your right to keep and bear arms I found this article today from Colin Powell fascinating\n\nThe fact that he cannot see what I just picked apart in his own eyes with his own eyes\nConcerns me\nBecause I don't believe Colin Powell is intellectually dishonest\n\nI Believe what he is is blinded by any allergy\n\nIs blinded by idiots allergy his idiotic allergy is in lockstep with the coup falls\nClawing and scratching if the doors of the Supreme Court freaking out the Kavanaugh is now on the court\nA list them all on those who actually went on a television program on M. S. DNC and actually made one of the M. F. B. and C. eggers eyes get big and throw a goofy I Wish I could provide you that visual\nBut she was on a split screen with the two MS DNC desk eggers when she said Donald Trump was exerting some type of cult dish you know thing to everybody you know some magic powers or even the FBI and it was the stupidest thing I've ever heard in\nMy life but that's where these people are\nThey are deranged they are so wind it by any allergy that they cannot see the facts before that do you think that Colin Powell a black man would be utterly thrilled\nThat black Americans are experiencing right now the lowest unemployment rate in history if you are black in America and want a job it's out there for you that's what I'm telling you\nIf you're not working and your black it's because you're choosing not to\n\nMiss should just go real Colin Powell but it doesn't\n\nMy wife is not been insulted by Donald Trump he only people who feel insulted by Donald Trump's have you noticed that are a bunch of left wing lunatics\nWho are what blinded by idi allergy\nThey will ignore the unemployment rate they will ignore the new Canadian American\nMexican agreement they will ignore China caving in and making a quote unquote new deal with Donald Trump that actually benefits America they will ignore\nThe numbers in their four O. one K. rising they will ignore the job numbers\n\nThey will continue to ignore Ninety the fact that Ninety seven percent of the media is attacking Donald Trump every single day they will ignore the fact that they ...\nThemselves in their own Twitter feed as a bunch of left wing lunatics what does all of this have to do with guns it is that any allergy those people so blinded by any allergy that are trying to take your gun that are so the rage\nThey are going on national television saying that Donald Trump is using some type of hours to reach me and you\nAnd ignoring everything we're talking about\nThese are the same people who are OK with sanctuary cities and states giving benefits that you\nWork for with your taxpayer dollars to people who are here criminally\n\nYou have to ask yourself how we got here so let's round third base and go into home because I think enough people\nAre now to use the Urban Dictionary word book and I think we saw with Lindsey Graham it W. R. Hawkins and I talked about Lindsey Graham yesterday\nLiving folks we're living in weird times you know we we are living in weird times in the United states of America\nThe women it it sounded like women's voices screeching ... in the Senate gallery I thought to myself if you want to be taken seriously is this how you behave well I mean\nIt's just it's just so bizarre that in the Senate gallery I mean these are people who you know it's a huge privilege to sit in the Senate gallery in your mind as as you go in there they knew these like professional activists knew that they were going in there to do this\nAnd I thought to myself that there's so many little pieces that you just put together first of all that the screaming and screeching was so\nHorrifying and it was really animal lipstick and was it was gross ... joy that\nNo no it was horrible it was hard but it but it was really like an animal lipstick shrieking and and and you know of course Mike Pence who's presiding had to\nYou know ask the sergeant arms to take care of these people and and to take them out so I thought to myself this is so sick sounding in on the TV and really I'm not getting it sounded like demons screaming is at some point he got very ugly right\nSo on Twitter I posted the demons you know screaming in the Senate gallery there's they're shrieking because they know their time is is is short or something like that right now obviously a there's two things going on first of all it's half of the joke right because even if they sound like demons but also\nUnfortunately it's only half of a joke because some times demons who are very real do screen through human beings and didn't manifest themselves in whatever right you know so I certainly wasn't calling these messed up people\nAnd the gallery demons right but you know people like wrote back at me and how can you say that they're demons and even that was even an article where somebody said that I called them demons and I thought we were at a point where you can't joke you can't say anything complicated you can't see anyone knew wants people are just\nRight insane and there's so much to say to unpack this I I thought\nUh in order to ... uh we need we need to call in the professional we do and so I thought a somebody who is possible who's making bad if we can get somebody begin ban and professionally John's mirror because I Can't handle it so I have to tell you it's so troubling so uh can we get John's mirror today or is he there looks\nLike dizzy their beagles knows willing him yeah yeah yeah\nYeah I like riding around with a with pig snout so there'll be\nRelative you ride them with pig parts that sweet ah John's Merrick what happened this weekend and what's been happening over the course of these weeks\nTo me um it's deeply disturbing because people some of whom uh many of whom I Would expect to know better or have descended into a kind of\nMob mentality that that says emotion is the only truth it's really something we've been living with this in this country for a long time but it's never been so high pitched literally and figuratively and it has never been so pushed\nA to this point we've come to a point where this idea\nThat emotion is the truest truth is ah we're living with it we we've been we've been seeing it people don't care about evidence or cooperation and if you don't give them evidence a corporation they say oh it's because you're hiding it or because the Senate didn't want to see it or it's just ... it's a never ending battle\nWith raw emotion what do we get\nYou know what I think we're dealing with is that the left to learn the lesson from the failures of the twentieth century they're not imitating the Bolshevik ... of the Nineteen twenties and thirties in Europe because those people sailed\nTheir imitating the brown shirts in Germany in the twenties and thirties 'cause they succeeded and I think the ... the most illuminating way to look at the way the left is operating in America and Western Europe today it's just study the brown shirts and what they did\nA they they went in and they corrupted the universities the highest percentage of voters for Hitler or university students and university professors of any group in Germany\nI mean the bizarre thing over\nThe universities they purged the books they they they ... how did it they purged books based on\nThe ethnicity of the authors\nJust today to nowadays they want to purge white male authors will back then they wanted to purge Jewish authors\nIt's the same phenomena and I think the best way to understand what's happening on the left today is is to study the Weimar period that's a fantastic book called the death of democracy or that just came out and it really does analyze\nHow the Nazis came to power in Germany and I really think at the FAA and the radical left in America\nHave studied the Nazi play book and that is what they're doing and\nAnd who wrote this book the death of democracy ... well\n... well\nI Can't I Can't hear you well we can we can look it up we have Google here in New York as well you know ...\nWhen Carter hit Benjamin Carter H. E. T. T. and what he says is it was the cowardice\nAll of the establishment in Germany the establishment parties the media the ... the army the churches the industrialists they\nWeren't willing to crack down on the extremists of both sides they they crack down on the communists but they weren't willing to crack down\nOn the Nazis and they thought the Nazis were fundamentally even if they were rough around the edges even if they were using violence even if there was silence increase speech they were doing it in a good cause so you kind of had to let them get away with it which is exactly what liberal authorities oh that was an chief on the left today\nI mean look it started in this country but let's be honest this whole thing really it comes out that this is the\nThe bitter fruit the sexual revolution and we saw this in the late sixties when students took over campuses uh invaded the president's offices at campuses like Columbia University right here in New York and the administration did not have the guts to stand that ride them now the harbor is\nThis is fifty years ago right\nAnd they were awarded for those people who took over the campuses and burn the buildings ended up getting tenure going into the institutions and taking them over and what we're facing now\nA replication of the radicalization we saw in the ... in Germany in the thirties and I think it's really that important and ...\nCall themselves crusaders against fascism well remember the Nazis claim they were defending German civilization from the ... of the Communist Party right when somebody has been noun sing something really loudly\n... you know look carefully maybe that's what he's really after maybe that guy dressed up as a fireman is in fact an arsonist\nWell that's that's exactly right and I have to say that you know when I was writing my book on born offer I thought to myself\nThe horrifying thing really about studying history as close as I did when I wrote that book is that\nYou begin to see that these weren't deem and these were real people just like us\nWho fell prey to certain bad ideas and all it took his little lack of courage here in a little lack of courage there in the little sloppy thinking here that's all it takes up for a great to ... to descend\nInto anarchy chaos genocide and I have to say what we're living through right now\nYou know I we need to be aware I guess it's why I Want to talk to you about this because this is not something that happens in a vacuum you have to understand that this didn't happen in the last year this is something that's been brewing for a long time so it must be really understand it\nOr at its core understand where it comes from where it's taking us but I Want to continue the conversation folks at the our taxes from talking to Jon ... Iraq we're going to talk about the rule of law about evidence about the patriarchal ideas like reason and logic\nOr this their taxes she'll go to our website ma taxes talk dot com we'll be right back [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nTwenty theater [noise] [noise] hello [noise]\n\nI don't see how my life can get any better [noise]\nEverything to feel like everything around me is falling apart if something doesn't change soon\nI just don't know what else I can do [noise]\n[noise]\nOr some counseling is here to help our team of license Christian ... want to help you get to read this we can begin a conversation when you're ready now I text your phone or even video conferencing from the comfort of your own home\nI'd like to give you your first we free to try faithful counseling dot com let's talk go right now to try faithful counseling dot com we really want to help you I mean it's so easy to get started and your first week is free to go now to try faithful counseling dot com let us\nAnd he got angry rightly defending himself and then they accused him of not having the right to additional temperament that's exactly what they did installing a show trials in the Nineteen thirties and Nineteen twenties and thirties and the thirties when Stalin put his opponents on trial he would accuse them of being\nSimultaneously a spy for Great Britain Nazi Germany and the Vatican\nAnd then they would point out how ridiculous and self contradictory all these things were and and then they would say I could see the cleverness you see the subtlety you see how how twisted his logic is he's so good at covering all his tracks the very fact that he is making these arguments shows us what you need a spy he really is\nIt's it's so I mean I think that the only way uh to cut to the changes didn't say that that there is something of genuine satanic wicked innocent play I've ... I've never seen\n'em something that smells as evil as what we're seeing right now I mean there there there are bad things in this world but there are things that that are so none of the areas that you really can see the hand of the enemy I mean there are good people that I Know\nWho who have been so caught up in the emotion of this and who are so upset about their own sex abuse or something that that\nIs taking the foreground in this conversation ... ... you know you want to say listen if you care about people not being sexually abused you better make sure that when you accuse someone you don't do it in a way that even slightly paws make sure you take this as seriously as you want everyone to take it\nUm when it concerns somebody who maybe didn't do it and I think that that's what we're seeing is that we're we're seeing the undermining\nOf legitimate a sex abuse complaints because now it's us against them it's men verses women it's angry people versus law and order it's it's become this this ridiculous um hodgepodge I I really\nUh as I say I'm I'm I'm really concerned for our country before uh we we return of this conversation\nFolks I Want to tell you about alliance

that could not be refuted that they left out every fact\nThat could be checked it they they cut off every opportunity for for for Kavanaugh to offer an alibi Eric I Would like to ask you what you were doing\nAt some point in the summer of Nineteen eighty two\nAnd I'm going to accuse you of having helped me Rob a grocery store or on Sunday night in some city somewhere in Maryland at some point in Nineteen eighty two you can offer an alibi you can't defend yourself to the charges are so big they were intentional out\nYou know what I have brought up I brought it up on my Facebook page and on Twitter a we have to go back to the novel to kill a mocking bird ... case where a woman\nAnd her father angrily emotionally accused a man of great uh uh violence uh some people remember the movie maybe read the book the movie of course during Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch defending a black\nMan or the black man a really couldn't defend himself very well things weren't looking good in this in this little southern town where you know the whites really ah\nHad the power until you have a man defending a Tom Robinson\nBut the woman who accused him her name is may Ella you'll\nAnd anybody who who's seen the movie it's just a searing performance by this woman because the anger the pain it's all so real\nThat doesn't connect with Americans he got up there he said when did it happen I don't remember where it happened I don't remember who is there I don't really remember but I had one beer\nI remember that that was born in what he did was he boiled down those legal talking points into ordinary language that said to the people of America an innocent guy is getting real wrote it by left wing elites\nHysterical violent active it's just because they want to keep control of the court so they can rural America by decree the way they've been doing for the last\nForty years since roe v weight and I'm not standing for it and you know what I think\nThe Democrats are not gonna take the house I think we're going to win the midterms precisely because we saw this naked power grab\nDisguised as concern for a victim\nI you know when I grow at once and I also think what I find interesting is that anytime anybody wants to frame thing as a men verses women issue\nThat's a failure and I'll say why because every woman has a father a many women have brothers and husbands and sons that they loved to death they loved them they adore them and they would want them\nTo get a fair\nA fair trial they would want that and so when they see this railroading maybe they they keep quiet about it because uh they don't want to get in the crosshairs of of someone angry in the family but privately they see\nThat when you railroad all men your real running them too because they love the men around them the men that have bless them and and would stand up for them just as I Would my daughter or my mother\nOr my wife or my cousins or anybody in my family my nieces and and there's so many men that would do that and so when you know those men\nAnd you hear men being demonized says all talk like you say you know what they've all done too far it's one thing to say oh I Believe women are equal in women should have an opportunity to have a career when I went along with that because that was all reasonable but what is happening\nNow is madness and I think many women are seeing the limits of feminism that that you're seeing something in contemporary feminism that is actually not only not speaking for women but its bizarrely anti woman it's reducing women it's an she stood wide certainly anti motherhood\nBut it it's reduced women and women screaming little art\nIn so far is now you have to pretend that a guy who takes some hormones and gets his parts cut off is this is a woman and if you don't believe that if you don't believe that a guy who says at the moment identified as a woman you have to accept them as a woman\nOr or your trans phobic\nI mean how completely bonkers that things have to get before people realize\nThat there is something the moniker insane\nAt wanting lose in in the feminist move I think the feminist movement right now really does come down to abortion ... there are no feminists organizations of any size that are pro life that there are no women's studies professors that I've been able to identify no living women's studies professor said I'd love to be contradicted who are pro life not one I\nDon't think you could get a pro life opinion\nMentioned in a women's studies department they monolithic I'm so insofar as feminism is about abortion is evil\nWell again I think that I mean I wrote about this in the preface to my seven women book that whenever\nWomen are pitted against men or men are pitted against women everybody loses when you tear down men you are tearing down women women don't win and the lie that it's somehow a seesaw one goes up the other goes down\nThat is absolute nonsense justice truth justice and the true love of God elevates everybody\nOn but we many Christians have bought into this uh many Christians of people who call themselves Christians seem not to understand that\nA a God loves men and women equally and to to track to to trash a whole group of people this way again I Know most of the women I Know there there's no way they're going to go along with this but they're gonna be quiet about it and I think in the mid terms\nOf the Democrats are going to be in big trouble because they've just gone too far\nYeah yeah but when you introduced that kind of power struggle and to the family is like what markets did with the class struggle\nYou where you are reporting the Marxist model of class struggle into the most intimate place in the world\nInto a family bedroom into the family room with the children you are taking calming the communist idea that everything is a struggle for power and if one games the other writers and your accepting that divisive demonic doctrine and applying it to your marriage\nWell that's right I felt were most folks I think no that that ain't gonna work we're going to be right back folks talking to Jon ... air attacks that show [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I try to

said the Kavanaugh thing is really it's tearing the country apart but I I kind of feel that even people I Would have respected before like like the New York times for example you'd think that they would have\nTo deal with the facts and even the New York times\nUh disarm strict report Taj they're leaning on this ... there's an article by my old friend Adam lip tack above the fold I don't know if what yesterday's paper Saturday's paper friday's paper\nIt couldn't be it has to be it might be today's paper but it was about how this um this the Kavanaugh thing has undermined the credibility of the Supreme Court and I thought [laughter]\nI Know a lot of us lost faith and the Supreme Court in Nineteen Seventy three when they made up the constitution pulled it out of its bodily or if it's to invent abortion rights out of nowhere what would that's when we stopped believing in the Supreme Court I wanted to bang on the doors of the Supreme Court when I learned about roe v Wade\nWelcome to the club buddy\nWell this is this is what's so hilarious and it's above the fold the New York times as though yes now all reasonable people are are upset about the partisan a character and you'd think wait a second it it became part isn't when people started legislating from the bench and what we're trying to do now in fact\nA first in Fairfield than Trumbull in Trumbull yeah okay I'm I'm from

the church and that don't mean nothing like it at home you grow up in the church but it was real for you\nYeah it was it was pretty good and yet when I was like Seventeen Eighteen I looked at my parents have said you know I'd never actually been baptized so then I get baptized finally when I'm senior in high school and move on from there you go to church where do I go to know where did you go where a black church\nYou went to black Rocco yeah grew up in pleasures incredible land grant never moved in this miraculous stuff that I was aware of no it was very foreign to me okay so when did you start moving into this miraculous phase\nSo um when I was Fifteen I went on a mission trip with teen missions to Alaska for the summer\nAnd first time I've ever met any real like spirit filled people and I thought well it's a classic kind of story they got something that I don't have and it's really attractive and if I can have it I Want it\nBut then you have all the how do you navigate the experiential side of it and the reality and the different nuances of the theology that you can explain that age but you feel it\nAnd but I still wanted it and so on the way I got introduced to the vineyard and they when I was by the time a senior in high school and you know John was still alive\nAnd John Limbert yep we mean John whistle I even I didn't know who John is sorry John Limbert Jon Weber is is the man who created the vineyard a and was really used by God\nTo normalize the concept of healing for today deliverance all this green stuff\nAnd I remember going to a like a charismatic conference in Nineteen Ninety I think it was an Indianapolis something like that and I heard him speak I'm wow uh this is for today go yeah but okay so and at what point do you think you'd go into the ministry\nUh when I was Fifteen I wow that yeah coming off that summer\nAnd I remember being on the summer and we're we're in a room in Alaska talking amongst ourselves just about God and how um a wonderfully isn't all that he's doing and this and that and a real love for them and while we would do that a presence would enter the room\nAnd you're like it was that I don't even want to breathe the wrong in case I it was so holy so profound intense I don't want to breathe wrong you don't want to scared away I don't want us scared away as if you could of course yeah but and\nI liked that I was I was like this is where I meant to be so when I found the vineyard there was that presence there yeah but also I was recounting the story one time with my brother between Fifteen sixteen years old and I realize\nThe ministry actually that's what I Want to do with my whole life [noise]\nIsn't that wonderful at that age it's such a I mean it's a rare thing in a way and such are a\nBlessing um so ... what did you go to college\n[noise] um I did but I did not at the time I got kinda side tracked 'em by life and what not and so I went to college but did not finish a couple of bad decisions early on in life and I'm so currently I Am finishing a theology degree\nAll that funny now you're doing now its way relevant now I think it's way smarter to to save college for when you you have a brain uh\nI mean really so many people are going to cause you're so young and you just don't know what you're doing I don't appreciate it and then years later on when you really appreciate it you know you can think boy it'd be nice to go to college out\nOh I was sitting down on 'em Roosevelt Island this week and looking out over the East River and I'm doing my reading from ice cores and everything I'm reading is just so\nRelevant to what I Need to be doing it's great it's a lot of fun okay so uh\nWhat do you do did you get married young children how old were you I just turned twenty three and it's not that you know the well we're coming up on twenty four years now yeah and Marine I yeah ...\n... so okay so you got you got married I mean honestly I always say to people if you can get married young I I always would advise and it's a beautiful thing so you only twenty three is pretty normal I think well anyway but so you get married you know how many kids did you have well\nI'm all in all we have five and but one of them are passed away so have you ever spoken about that as you go oh I it comes up when I'm teaching and whatnot yes\nYeah because I I didn't know that story until I read about it in the material you've sent us and I didn't know that something that uh\nThe honor to feature a little bit about the concern of many people struggling with this kind of thing and they need to know they're not the only ones yeah that way\nYeah it is it's a horrible journey and yet I'm the shorter but of course is that of course God's gracious but I'm the way that I have found and it's really started to kind of form something in my life right now\nOf um how do we deal with the pain in our life when most of the time we just don't want to [noise]\nSo for example therapists would say\nTo us you got to go to the grief and my wife and I would treated differently she'd say are you kidding me you're crazy and I'd be like oh yeah that makes a lot of sense so I Would go do that I Would I Would visit as it is helpful for me to visit his grave and stuff\nThat how old was your son Hayden when he passed away was four\nAnd a half [noise] yeah how many years ago this uh this is ten years ago now just as your officers ten years in June so um it it's some people asked me one time some friends said so how you doing is like\nThree months later and how you doing I'm getting in their kitchen and of course when you talk about this subject it tends to suck all the rest of the oxygen out of the room but I just said to him were in their kitchen and I said well here's what it's like like sitting in a fire\nIn all your friends are around you looking at you with these ... you looked pitiful and they're looking at you with this concern and care but they can't do a thing you're in the fire meaning all the pain of it until it's done yeah\nAnd I'm just trying to describe how bad you know kind of what it feels like and yet overtime is I don't think it's a God heals all wounds and the time he sorry God does your when time does not ... by itself but if we'll let God endure pain\nHe will he wouldn't\nHave gotten into that pain\nI'm your your your son drowned you said it was you were he was four and a half this is ten years ago yeah uh\nDo you do how do you deal with that I\nMean you say you got and how do you let got into something like that you\nYou express to him and you feel what's going on emotionally\n... excuse me one time I was at a vineyard conference a couple of years later and I was asking or there was a son that came on and and talking about you know if you call us to the fire and you don't ... your hand you know I'll I'll say go I'll still go [noise]\nAnd I'm saying lord I Can't do this and I had just all of a sudden the lord started to encounter me in the same way in that room years earlier and I started to cry out to him and said did you see me\nDid you see what I did for you when he died I didn't deny you I write ...\nOn because this is so big I

Lancaster, Pennsylvania ... century of in your church every\n... so uh I ... I began to\nWant to take the church and the people to that and in one sense it felt like there were like well when did we ever become charismatic and I'm like well it's not about charismatic\nUm per se but at one point I found that I got to point of I don't know how to get to the next step and so a mutual friend of Ken's and mine had met Ken and I reached out to him and said do you think Ken would help me\nSo I he can basically said yes we started connecting and so really I'm In about two thousand eleven in earnest when I um\nI had some basis from being so long in the vineyards but that was when it really currently started taking off and I'm One of Ken's first questions to me on the phone was so have you ever cast out a demon\nNice and I I so want it to impress him\nAnd Michael

fascinating 'cause there's so many Syria's Christians who just don't believe in this and they don't even get near it and I think it's weird or something and you think well no it's it's pretty
