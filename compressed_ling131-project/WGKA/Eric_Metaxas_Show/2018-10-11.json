Paul sort of the congressional baseball game we need to address the gun issue in hash tag pound assault weapon ban\nPound commonsense gun legislation to Seventeen twenty Seventy Jamie Lee Curtis on march Eighteenth twenty eight teams all previous light hearted tweets get dismissed immediately as a heavy heart reality of another school shooting takes us back to the need for stronger gun legislation\nAll of which they have proposed by the way would have stopped nothing they've Jamie Lee Curtis is whining and crying about because I guess Jamie Lee Curtis thinks evil only exist in her Halloween movies\nNow according to half of the ... I found this brilliant some people on Twitter replying to Fox News tweet argue that Curtis should not glorify gun violence in her film if she's against using firearms in real life\nBut most of those who responded pointed out they make it so easy pointed out Curtis was playing a fictional role\nWho's Laurie stroke character arms herself in defense of serial killer Michael Meyers\nAnd asked the Fox news actually knew what movies are and had heard of acting let me they they make this ... did you hear what I just said couldn't get any easier one more time most of those who responded pointed out Curtis was playing a fictional role\nWho's Laurie Strode character arms herself in defense of serial killer Michael\nMeyers that was a fictional killer\nHow about all of the other killers who aren't fictional in real life real life killers are fictional in real life people arming themselves against real life killers who would attempt to kill somebody just like portrayed in the movie\nExcept in the movie the people who are killed\nSit back up and put new makeup on but in real life they die\nIt doesn't matter whether she is wielding a gun in a fictional movie it's why she's wielding the gun in a fictional movie\nSo she can defend herself and the children and the others around her from the fictional killer just like we would all want to be able to do in real life against the real killer\nIt doesn't matter that the plot is fictional it matters that the gun is used in the fictional plot for the same reason a gun is used in real life in a real plot a real killer\nThat leading figures in the Democratic party hearing you know a senator if you can imagine a Hillary Clinton at Maxine Waters or they have all calls for\nPeople to be on civil now just think about that these are leaders they're supposed to be the ones leading and telling people to be calm and civil and so Brian he'll need a was on the receiving end of some instability so uh remember he's the host of Fox and friends when we come back\nFrom the break after this segment we're going to interview him about that so we're going to be we're gonna try and kill me a couple of minutes I'm an hour to today we have Sebastian\nGorka ... now I Love Sebastian Gorka he's like the heroic figure we've had him on this program many times but we have not had him in person to be very very exciting to have him in person in the studio he's doing um a you know a big a push for his brand new book why we fight\nA he really is a very inspiring finger and so I'm going to be excited to greet him right here in the studio and he's a big figure to you so you didn't hurt huge mhm yeah on TV looks normal silo and everybody on T.
