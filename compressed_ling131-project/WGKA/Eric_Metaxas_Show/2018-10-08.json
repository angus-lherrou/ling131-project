smartphone that I really enjoyed it three dollars for the Iranians or Android app store\nTo the final formation for this hour on front lines of freedom to continue our conversation with all of them are for them to the map pays about warriors and women in combat [noise]\nCamera you've made some good points I Know you have several more lots more people were planning to do this for several weeks in the future what are some key issues we have a discussion about women in our military [noise] like I\nSaid just the perception that yes there are some women and there's also\nCan be considered the quote unquote leak or Lincoln your unit [noise]\nBut [noise] it kind of pre judge females that come into your unit before they even get a chance to prove themselves this kind of an unfair advantage\nAnd then the drawback is being a new person over and over again when I became a civilian and two thousand sixteen and I didn't realize how morale sudden exterior and then I had because I spent so many years happening approve myself and things are worse than the ... all the things\nThat someone I transitioned it made me very ... almost an approach of all because they're like you are too much personality I had to learn to\nCalm down to realize I didn't have to prove anything to anyone anymore I just needed to do I need to do\nThat came from my whole air force career of over and over again trying to prove that I can work hard just as much as the guy I can pull my weight just as much as the guy I had to carry two hundred pound man to safety I worked really hard to even get close to that\nWell there we go I mean to a large extent if the person male or female and their attitude and their willingness to do whatever it takes to get the job done\nI think you'd agree with that and obviously bigger stronger people guards have younger can do some things have smaller we can people can have two and you don't really have a role in that you don't get a chance to decide how tall you are I guess you could decide wait but only limited degree so yeah there's a difference there\nWe need to take that into account ... what are your thoughts on\nWhy live with amber said about commitment and determination because you know there's several things that a warrior need first of all you have to have a deep abiding passion for a particular ID or subject for cars but you also have to be committed to it in other words the first time you come up to an obstacle you can't quit so you have to have the determination and that stick to it in\nBut you also have to have that willingness to sacrifice personally sometimes even physical sacrifice and\nI think where young men have a significant advantage in combat young men just have this disregard for their personal safety they jump off bridges they drive motorcycles real fast and get into trouble they fight each other\nWomen have a totally different in general now women have a different way of dealing with each other it's more of a social violent you will but it's the same reason why you Sharon's companies if you're a male under twenty five check out your rate if we were all this name\nI mean it's just intuitive insurance companies know that is why if you rent a car or if you have insurance if you're a male under twenty five even if you're a gentle mail even if you're an artist doesn't matter because in general young men or violence and they like danger so I think in in that specific sense they're much more suited\nIn general for violence combat war\nThat kind of situation and certainly history has shown that history but I Would like to add that there's a lot of different lawyers in our country there's social lawyers or domestic whereas I mean\nProbably the biggest worry is we have are women that\nFirst of all give birth of children let's face it if it was made up the money they want to go there would be no you know and they're gonna number two just raising kids right way is a constant contact can you talk about the three things I talked about you've got commitment determination and the ability to sacrifice I mean there's no better warrior than\nWomen that are raising your kids I mean that is not for the faint of heart but an upset\nThe point is this girl going to get on the front lines of freedom but it's got some women and warriors with automatic weapons of mass phase one leaf we haven't talked about is sexual tension boys white girls girls like boys and fixing the twenties when you put them together they are going to pair up or at least tried to pair up\nAnd that kind of all kinds of tensions if the three of us were about the same age and the same unit ... and I are going to be in competition for Adams attention\nProbably or whether she likes either one of us that's going to cause some tension and our unit\nAnd if she happens to like one of us that's going to cause more tension in arguments about is a reality which does not occur in an all same gender you know an example in World War two the Russians were desperate to beat the Germans had all female ever freedoms and they worked\nIn the Israeli ... their first wars in Nineteen forty eight they put women anywhere and everywhere and it worked\nBut they don't anymore Israelis do have all female or ... and stuff like that they don't mix the genders you know the Russians anymore in close combat units because of at least sexual tension so that's something that has to be considered to all of us we're wrapping up what she points would you like our listeners take away from our chat today\nThe veteran had made me a strong person let alone a strong woman and therefore that will carry for you know when I said have kids that I'm going to raise them to be strong individuals to be\nIt's a carrier for itself we let women being in a stronger role it's just going to carry forward in the next generation because we're letting men and women be strong and we will therefore teach our kids to be strong to make this country great military great keep doing what we're doing an expense [laughter] well\nIt does make sense because what we're talking about here is real life not some academic points that we're trying to make\nAnd I certainly if there's anything our country needs today it's kids who know who they are growing up to the adults who know who they are I don't know what their values are who have their culture and want to go ahead and they only learned that from their family get mad at your thoughts\nWell in terms of the top of you brought up about sexual tension reminds me of the movie a few good men where the colonel was supposed to tell the men that private Santiago wasn't to be touched but then he transferred him off the base and he's being drilled or the jury it's like why the two wars private Santiago wasn't to be touched your men always follow your orders\nThen why wasn't necessarily transfer him off the base and he couldn't answer right well it's the same thing we should be able to tell our young men in the military a hands off these women or your comrades ... they're not the sexual object\nBut it's going to happen invariably you put twenty year olds in a box oh yeah and some things are going to be ... especially in today's environment where lots of different things can be construed\nBy either gender as sort of an unwanted sexual advance so many things in fact I had a friend the other day waiting very highly others I mean not any time in about a girl in college that she is mentoring saying that a guy made a pass at me and now I've got to tell her that that's not appropriate and I said\nAnd so I said you mean if someone starts with you it makes it past that you did that can be considered ... sexual events and she can backtrack and said well not necessarily but if you don't like it you should tell them I said I completely agree but\nYou know ... so there's there's such a ... disconnect these days in what's considered appropriate and what's not appropriate and most twenty year olds have no idea that line where the line I'm\nThinking back on that real cliff redhead play the other part so working in and they'll have the ... luckily I grew up in a first responder family so I already had skin knowing that was only possible on the sexual harassment and math and all those kind of thing that I'm you know I was always told\nAs long as they don't put their hands on yeah it's just words so I always had that like they were trying to say 'cause if I was offended by everything it what it really made a bad work environment as a sign up and say whatever they had to say and not think anything but I think the silver lining there too with\nWomen have a hard time this industry kindness ... yes\nAnd so I kinda want to remind our female listeners too that if someone says something and we always tend to like make our judgment on how attractive we are to that person\nUh-huh so that's another thing is just take the compliment it's okay as long as they're not doing anything to invade your space it put their hands on you just it's OK\nWell out of my love the fact that you had that mentality in all honesty I Try to get into the air force first and I guess I was in the air force material but the army was allowed to take me to I think we would have served very very well together every bit of in the same time\nCan't let the little things bother me at like ... I got to remember who I Am working with and ... what's going on in their mind and I hate to say that that it's almost want to have the upper hand to where they can set the tone of the environment if I can tell someone straight theater they let it get to me because their word I don't know how I Will ever would have made fourteen years\nWell put well obviously this conversation is not over it is for today but we need to pursue this\nBecause this is a direction our nation is moving we need to be thinking about it once and for sure if we conclude and if our nation concludes that women can serve anywhere Houdini and put we are march over the next time we have a war all women will be drafted and most of them will end up in the country 'cause that's where most\nOf the need is because if you don't do that there'll be lawsuit is that where we want to go to a batch for our next discussion so thank you all for taking the time to join us today thank you for your service or nation I appreciate you ought to well thank you for having me I really enjoy the math glad you could join me today thank you done it was a privilege\nOkay here's our sample group report for today this is when we find it on a form of duty and we all get auditors find truth\nIn Pennsylvania National Guard soldier completed the American ninja award television show in Philadelphia on may nineteenth some twenty of army sergeant tighter waters motor transport operator with every thirty shepherds engineer battalion fifty fifth maneuver and has ... brigade ... division which seventeenth and the competition\nUnited American patriots support our brave American proof for wildly inappropriate reasons have been jailed for murder by our military because they shot the enemy in combat [noise]\nThat sounds crazy but it's true if you find this beyond belief like I did check their website United Patriots dot or whoever you this hour we're going to discuss buying a home using the VA long with real ... allows more from\nJay Z partners don't discuss VA loans with mortgage guy Brad Stone National Review last week's service academies football games and of course we'll conclude with our weekly mailbag military history in our armed America report groups I welcome your comments or questions contact me from front lines of freedom dot com\nIt's a pleasure to welcome back to the show my friend Cindy allows more she's was huge realty partners in Michigan her husband is my friend and navy vet Dave\nThanks for joining us ... hey Danny thanks for having me Cindy in my opinion buying houses like buying a house is complicated however you plan to pay for whatever your goals are it's a complex thing which has to do it right you need to plan you know what you're doing going into it\nBecause one it costs so much money and to your family or a liberal or in the neighborhoods or schools and everything so the impact there so you got to be thinking ahead how should you be thinking ahead when you're thinking about a house before you approach anybody\n[noise] the first step that people need to take is to contact the mortgage lender make sure their credit is in shape established their budget and then they could start looking for the home with in their budget and just because they're qualified for\nTwo hundred thousand dollars it doesn't mean that they have to purchase a home for two hundred thousand dollars they can look below that price range so that they they ...\nOh because when a large or gives them their top dollar amount they still have to take into consideration the utilities and the taxes and the insurance\nAnd I think that that where sometimes people get a little excited when they hear that they're qualified\nFor a large amount they start looking at pictures on line and they start to fall in love with the home that that the top of their budget and then they realize wow with this budget of two hundred thousand dollars or higher they still have everything else to pay for rent groceries the utilities\nThat puts a ruler in a whole doesn't it when somebody comes and they want something they can't afford or they're looking at something that is the wrong house even though it was cheaper\nOr they can't afford it at all or they're not qualified for anything or they're qualified for much more they could have more that sort of puts the router awkward spot doesn't cause I'm telling you I Want this and I want that but I Can't afford either of them or if somebody came to you would you immediately them referring to mortgage person and then have them come back to you\nI Would I Would make sure they were pre approved prior to me taking them to look at home because I don't want to be that agent that takes them to look at something that they can't afford it because I don't want to be the one to Taliban after they've fallen in love with it that they can't habits\nYeah who wants to be that person\nRight and I don't want to sell them something that in the long run they can't afford even though I paper they can afford it in reality\nYou know the impact on their lifestyle will be so negative\nAbsolutely and I don't want to be responsible for that\n[noise] so if I were coming to you wanted to buy a house you told me to go first to find out what I should mortgage why so for that's not necessarily what my wife and I walk to afford correct that's where you pick it up\nRight and if you don't have a mortgage officer you know I I work with several of them so I can refer to one of course however if you don't have that established first bang you're just spinning your wheels and you're wasting everybody's time\nSo if I come to you is there anything for two years that you were telling me to do or not knew if I wanted to by using a VA mortgage\nI Would suggest you find the lender that specializes in VA mortgages okay\nBecause things change constantly and you want to be sure that you had somebody that knows all of those changes can keep your breast and everything\n'cause of action or to know about it once as a moving target so you need somebody who's current once they do that then they're approved for a mortgage and then they're just a person with money they can borrow event or how much ... and you could help them go find a house correct\nAnd I would work with their lender\nOnce they found a home to make sure that it's within their budget\nOkay this is important votes because if you haven't bought a house these are the kinds of things that you can walk into and if you go in with your eyes closed\nOr just thinking well just find somebody in a bubble you need people particularly VA loans who are very current and Cindy there are real truth who specialize not exclusively but who specialize in helping military veteran people buy homes Arthur correct\nThere are relocation specialists that works specifically you know obviously with other buyers and sellers diet\nIs typically which that trend\nOkay and obviously they are going to stay more current than the average person who you all do it but I ... a researcher first crack\nDown an agent that specializes on relocation for veterans working with a lender that also specializes in the VA lonely because there are a lot of changes not so much on an agent standpoint but from the lenders standpoint there's a whole lot of changes\nYou are a real truth who does some specialization and helping veterans may because you're married to one and grabbed a mortgage I Will be on next also focuses on helping veterans that's why you two guys are on today\nLet's wrap it up if a veteran came to you saying I Want to buy a house my family were moving here or we want to move up or down sized wise whenever I Want to move helped me wrap up for two or three things you'd want him to do first before anything else\nIf they reached out to me first and they did not have a lender or perhaps they said you know we're going to go through maybe USA or maybe ... or something they're great lenders however if you\nCan find somebody locally that specializes in VA low such as Brad I can physically go to Brad office and get answers from him versus if somebody were to work with us a and I just called the one eight hundred number they don't know me from Adam and they're not accountable\nWhereas I can go to somebody locals who specializes NBA loans and that person I can hold accountable for answers and to keep the ball moving so that by or a stellar Ken yet their qualification\nThat sounds like good advice wherever you live\nThe little research and find a ... that is trustworthy and preferably is a real cursory specials and worked with events and with that person find good VA mortgage type person that's a technique or work anywhere in the world that we're in the United states anywhere\nAnd it increases the probabilities that you're not going to run into a brick wall at some point along the way\nThat's safe get\nCindy wrap it up for us if people anywhere in the United states want to touch base with just to get some more advice more insight more whatever hardly richer\nThey can go to our Web site J. H. real T. dot com or they can simply Google\nG. H. real key and they will actually click right at our website and now find me or they can Google me Cindy loves them\nAnd this lady I Know her she knows what you're talking about if this was a very used to I'm delighted\nCindy thank you for taking time to join us today thank you for your concern for veterans I Know married into the family and all that good stuff but that doesn't mean you have to work as hard as you do to stay current to help that I appreciate that so thanks for joining us today\nThank you Danny\nI'm going to give them next up we're going to discuss the mortgages with a

to be in Colorado Springs Colorado was\nBeautiful weather warmed up to about eighty two as we look over a or able to look at pikes peak and watch a pretty good gang as well even though the falcons did not prevail\nWell as we were talking before their second half was a whole lot better than the first half wasn't\nIt really was standing in the first pass a playing the Nevada wolf pack where they sell twenty eight to twenty five the first half was really I really a catastrophe was bad foot but it is no sugar coating it no way around that\nArea and worth meant just could not get anything going for the off chance that defense Everytime you looked up from talking to my buddy's there was another past going into and all that at the half the wolf pack had a Twenty one seven lead and truthfully air force was fortunate that it wasn't any worse at that time\nBut in the second half of the shows from resolve and they show something that if they're really going to need next week they changed quarterbacks and and the second half they started off with a forty three year if you go from Jake ...\nThan there was another touchdown sprinkled in there from Nevada but the markers Bennett van

yard run eleven place sixty seven yards and those aren't the familiar types of Dr we like to hear from our cat and maintains\nTowards the end of the game air force made it close to defense held and

I think in the ... from mistaken in civil suits\nThe preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just for ... but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\nThe Republicans seem to show absolutely fairness of the accuser and giving deference to the wavering members in his own caucus the way the confirmation one vote\nWeek as the FBI made it official in where he\nMet with guys from the second ranking Republican in the United States Senate also a member of the Judiciary Committee John Cornyn also formerly a Texas Supreme Court justice [noise] now\nIf in fact when we get word that the FBI has done and that should all centers will have the report it's okay to file the notion of culture because that just thirty hours of debate people will have plenty of time to read the report\nThat's right under the Senate rules are there will be at least a an intervening day or the other words you filed today tomorrow intervening day and then the vote cloture vote wouldn't be until the following day so there'll be plenty of time for senators to read the FBI's a supplemental background investigation\nSenator I represented the victim of the sexual assault on a major college campus I catch a more because of confidentiality I'm very sympathetic to victims because the institution that America has not yet adopted to deal with these but that they're changing nevertheless I'm a lawyer like you and I know one\nThe fear of flying narrative that was given to the committee that simply wasn't true it wasn't given by her I was getting by the lawyers her ex boyfriend has filed an affidavit saying she is familiar with polygraphs inconsistent with it\nTestimony testimony and this is a lawyer deal could not contain a single verifiable assertion nor one that could be disproven that I'm very rare and then we have the Rachel Mitchell Report are there are problems with her testimony\nWell there are some was a well a ritual Mitchell a\nWho was retained by the committee to question Dr Ford um and I thought that a very professional job\nBut I thought she got the basic facts out to the demonstrated that there are gaps I understand the victims of of trauma can have memory lapses and it's hard to reconstruct things after thirty five years but I just don't think and I think the American people don't believe that uncorroborated\nAllegations should be enough to condemn or a nominee\nSo let's go to the last issue which is Jerry now lower the incoming chairman of the house Judiciary Committee if the Democrats take the house\nSays he will hold impeachment proceedings I say bring those on because they will be laughing stocks about Seventy rule I just got into it she said Brett Kavanaugh allied I said he absolutely did not lie about drinking he did not lie about devil's triangle people who say that don't understand what perjury is are lying is your assessment a senator\nWell I think it's this has gotten a a ridiculous absurd we're talking about in prison as high school yearbook whether he threw ice on somebody at some point in the past um I think they've been unsuccessful in attacking the judges credibility\nAnd feel like a now they're all from this wild goose chase and uh the goalposts has five friend the majority leader like say a ... continued to move a but it's time to vote\nHere's what Lindsey Graham said on Fox News last like cutting number Fifteen what about these red state Democrats I think their toes\nAll of them all up\nAll of them politically anybody I Know the only two that are open seemingly ... even though there is no senator\nCornyn Joni Ernst agreed with that do you agree with that\nI I agree uh because I think I'm In these red states that President Trump carried the I think that uh I take the judicial officer on so I think the Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are are confirming what a lens he just said\nAs the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to\nA duck Cory Gardner who's the chairman this year as a as a basically confirmed\nThat you know I think things very big is going on I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the visceral rejection of McCarthyism directed at\nBrett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because if they are being so badly injured\nAnd I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw his hat them and judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry or what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and this uh this ridiculous\nAllegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or heard not display the appropriate temperament on the bench this man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nUh there were a couple of times where I think well one time in particular where he asked judge or to their corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut uh he shouldn't be expected just to take a\nSlander these allegations of criminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position who feels like they've been falsely accused I think would be angry and be justified and I'm a showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be a blight some good shape because of the FBI report not to vote for\nUm judge Kevin I I think it will be a huge mistake unless they're direct corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican doesn't support him his or her career done as a Republican I've never seen the base of his way is that the general sense in the ...\nI think you'll see overwhelming support in the caucus for ah for the judge\nIn the middle of this political debacle another letter blurred at there was from the president of the American bar association Robert Carlson here's my Salem College Larry Elder that letter that the\nPresident of the ab a sense urging the Senate Judiciary committee to hold off voting on\nJudge Kavanaugh till the FBI investigation literally written by the president of the ... name of Robert Carlson turns out Robert ... deny permission from the standing committee to send that letter and there are unhappy that he sent it without their permission and they're unhappy that people are suggesting that the ... has withdrawn its support of Brett Kavanaugh they have not\nThey didn't want to make and now they're so I felt very nicely for negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come to hopefully with China because they they are the worst or you know abusers of the trade laws and on the planet\nOne other quick thing Larry I was there at the rose garden when Donald Trump\nHad his past outbreaks of one of the points you made it look I Want to use these tariffs has a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with the topic but what is it working because these countries are reducing their care or\nEven a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries\nAnd the University of Chicago survey of top economists found Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off with NAFTA than the previous previous so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI did you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped out now but back in Nineteen Ninety three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nBut Trump also had a point that it could be approved and those are the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement it's now called the uh you asked them to see a we're not going to call NAFTA any longer but it is a new on North American trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries\nUh it has modernized and give us Americans a better deal and uh so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing a minimum wage out in other countries right and that's one of the things I don't like about this the also very it got me on that one that is not you know we would we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics and this plan\nA show I'm going to agree with you on that one\nSo on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for the candidate has imposed against us and lowers terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nNot just idling just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of you know as you know we talked about this on your show before war and more what Americans producers called intellectual property we there's computer software we Patton sent copyrights\nAnd acknowledge each and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and some and certainly China and and and then the other countries and Asian countries they just steal our intellectual property and this
