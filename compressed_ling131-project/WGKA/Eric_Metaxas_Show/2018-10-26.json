R. G. it's all and things to armed AR immunity to it seven to two to leave the gun writer Williams\nWelcome back to the show my friend I'm Glad you could make it [noise] care of my pleasure it's always a pleasure to have you here brother um you want to put any escalation points on anything we talked about um it'd be so easy to keep you want to hear just go another hour to start getting angry mark out you know\n[laughter] well you know I think you kind of a force shattered it a bit everyone watched their legislature\nIn every state that has a preemption I think that is the new tactic why why why go after somebody autos where I go after ammunition or standard capacity magazine they're going right for the job or by going through going for preemption I think that will be a new tactic so everyone needs to be aware of that and be watching out for that\nThis is just government run amok in your face is what it is let me give you an example in the state of Georgia where I reside July first governor deal Republican signed this no texting no phone hands free phone deal\nIt is illegal for me to touch my telephone it cannot be on any part of my body at all while I'm driving a vehicle\nPeriod I I Can't rested on my leg that's a ticket can't have it between my legs under my crush or my style I'm driving up the ticket I Can't pick it up or move and put it in the consul I Can't touch it on the council if it's on a little hook thing\nUp on the dashboard I'm not allowed to touch it with my fingers however I can touch the radio screen next to it and I can change the radio dial and I can turn my air conditioner fan on an up and I could turn it down or I can turn it can do whatever I Want\nIn my own car I can reach bra soda and drink it while I'm driving I can go through a drive through an order fifty hamburgers and eat all of them on my way to tamp if I Want to\nI can touch anything else on the phone I can look back and yell at my kids if I Want to but I Can't touch my damn phone and that's a state law and I get a ticket\nI Can't even touch the navigation scream mote screen on it while I'm ...\nYou know let me tell you something at some point in time governments in your face get out of my car get off my phone if I Want to use my phone I Will because nobody's gonna come out and said texting and driving kills people it does\nBut what I don't need as the government taking my rights and we and privileges away from me because I Can't talk to what you do is you go after you put you put a campaign out much like we did with seatbelts right\nYour camera shame that people who do those things that are getting people killed\nTo the point where when somebody else sees you they hit there who are they do whatever it is but you don't tell me I Can't touch my phone 'cause I'm going to touch my phone I'm telling you that right now if I have to use ways I've used it a number of times I'm going to use it and no state law going to stop me from doing that\nIt's just the way it is wow I'm such a bad person we I just had to get that off my check to make myself feel better\n[laughter] but this is\nThe same type of thing this is preemption a little local town filled with a bunch of people who for whatever reason never made it where they wanted to make it in life who just want to be a pain in whatever to everybody else and run their life and so you can't carry that got in my park\nAbsolutely ignoring the stupidity of what it's like when you have a state concealed carry license\nThat allow somebody to carry throughout the state that now has to worry about Seventy five different counties in their dopey little law the absurdity of it is insane because guess what's going to happen people are going to do like I Do with my phone in my car they're going to carry their gun anyway\nAnd they're not going to worry about it what am I missing\n[noise] no I think ... especially when you brought up a true ways I mean the only people on the H away boards or people without enough to do and it's it's just like these little municipalities you know they gotta they gotta\nTinker around almost sort of non suitable word they got to take her because they've got nothing better to do [noise]\n[noise] yeah it's crazy people tell you look I'm not telling people to violate the law\nI don't text and drive why because it's dangerous I Know that I don't need the state signing a piece of paper telling me that I don't\nText and drive it's it's very difficult to do I don't know how people do this but it is mind boggling you drive by I got a truck I set up higher I look down and actually people do it all the time\nThey're on they're holding the phone with the steering wheel and they're texting away with their thumbs going ... miles a minute and inevitably every one of the eventual he's kind of words over to you at which point I Love your morning my truck scaring the crap out of\nAll right but that's unfortunate that that to to me that's just another example of government and the way when it shouldn't be we we we shouldn't need a law\nTo tell us not to do that okay but\nNonetheless that's a I call that a that's an H away type law are evil people you know evil exist in this world I Know you know\nI Do [laughter] it's really bad how evil people can be isn't it\nYes trust me it it it is\nYou understand that so you carry a gun for your own self defense because he voted this and you understand that an accepted that right correct you also know that evil will bite you went issues is not when it's going to say to you and give you advance warning I'm going to bite you tomorrow to thirty PM\nTour with such situational awareness ship couldn't agree more\nNow if you if people if you don't believe me that there is evil out there let me read you a headline today this is from Fox News Texas man allegedly search dark defined young girls who murder\nAnd eat [noise] Texas\nMan allegedly searched dark Web to find young girl who murder and eat that if you look at a picture of the clown this guy looks like a young incarnation of Jeffrey Dahmer ...\nFree Dahmer eight dozens of people these are there are bad people this guy stands behind you at a gas station line\nThis guy walks in front of a step you may have said oh no go ahead and let him go first in a grocery store by he may have open the door for this idiot people walk amongst us leak why is it that we can live in denial that there are bad people like this out there\n[noise] well I don't I Know you don't either I don't know why people can I don't know how you search any any website look at a newspaper you it's undeniable that evil exists\nI think in a way maybe I can answer this because it's easy to deny it if we don't want to think about it so we just don't we don't want to think that that here's what this guy said\nTo a federal agent that responded to his post on the dark Web and claiming to be that he was interested in fulfilling the guy's request here's what he said nice I'm In east Texas how old is your daughter can weed killer\nAs in Mormon not ... like apple ... warmer man like in ... more men were talking about Mormonism would carry Sheffield I'm ... ... but a ... I got a few things on my chest that I'm very excited about you and I first of all we got announced the contest\nMhm another contest ... but this is a fun this is a lot of fun this is the kids out there ready yeah OK\nObviously my book a Donald drained the swamp features a hero called Donald the caveman if a if you celebrate Halloween or you don't celebrate Halloween because I have mixed feelings on it but the point is people dress up in costumes and Halloween is a good time to bring this up\nIf you or your kids dress up as Donald they paid man for Halloween and you take a picture\nAnd you send us the picture\nWhen he will send you\nA signed copy of Donald drain the swamp and now we have a limit of five so this is the first five\nWho send us a picture will get a signed copy of Donald drain the swamp from me including a a he's my caveman button and he's my caveman sticker album and those are worth thousands of dollars\nThey are yes you know and by the thousands I don't mean thousands I'm speaking metaphorically yes but but um if I just want to say you want a signed copy it\nYou've got to get signed copies personalized okay a airplane taxes will sign your copy and personalize it to you if you send us a picture of yourself dressed\nAs Donald the caveman it's going to say it's gonna be an effort enough to fill a costume or something is a big deal but if you do it we will send you a signed copy\nOf Donald drain the swamp and it wouldn't hurt it in the picture you're holding a copy of Donald drain the swamp route but I I just think this can be fun it's Halloween it's\nYou know whatever I can I suggest if you go to your Thanksgiving dinner your family's Thanksgiving dinner dressed as Donald ... says while you get two books if you go to say Thanksgiving that's a month away well I Know right now to okay Halloween first the first\nFive people who do this we'll get assigned book now there is a big assignment a it's a big deal but you get a signed copy of Donald drained the swamp he'd get a button and a sticker or right now the best one\nThe best one gets three sign books three stickers three buttons right okay that's the that's the best one so we got from the limit of five\nThe first five but of all the ones that come in the best one and this has to be cut off by election day so November fifth or sixth\nWe're going to award the best one three sign books\nThree stickers and three of a button so I Hope somebody has fun with that this is this is there's so many creative people out there creative parents uh but you know a a blonde wig and some kind of a club\nSome kind of a cost and that's the tough part but he probably make it out of cardboard who's going to notice that the photograph so you do what you like hey do you like but we had we had to announce the contest there to announce\nOkay and then that that goes to your website right air for taxes dot com any website you one way you can any way you could get it to us right\nFor actually you can send it to info at Eric ... taxes dot com okay um there's so much to talk about al ... or so much to talk about good um before I forget uh at at the book before we go to before we go to Carrie Sheffield a\nI've got a I've got a couple of fun announcements or I Want to make but I don't forget to mention alliance defending freedom is is this is very important okay a life defending freedom folks uh I got to tell you right now or were behind so if you're inclined to give\nA let's just say that you know all over America I mean we notice that the federal and local authorities are pursuing leads into suspects who who might have sent these uh these bombs with these explosive devices by the way none of them went off so it makes me wonder if the whole thing's a PR stunned\nBecause you're right okay but um anyway the point is that these things present like a clear and present danger to the political system because everybody's talking about it's a big mess but I just want to tell you folks there is something that is\nConstantly a danger a month ago a year ago five years ago five years from now religious liberty is genuinely under threat is a serious secular forces are chipping away at our Judeo Christian roots and religious freedom is being threatened so I Want to push\nThe said please give to life defending freedom\nOr they they defend people for forty okay and this is it you know by the way Bob Trent who's like when they said that a seemingly small ways\nUh our that our religious freedom as infringed upon can become a huge legal challenges right and then you get charges of intolerance bad press horrible stuff we got to take that there's got to fight it idiot that's fighting here's a clip from Bob print\nWhen you have these conflicts that become between the algae beach community and people of faith and people say well can't we all get along well that's not what they're looking for what they're looking for is active support active participation I Will come and find you and even though there's another fifty bakers or fifty Flora's that'll serve me for free I Want you to do it\nAnd the fact that you have a religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman is unacceptable so it it tolerance even though it should be a two way street often in these instances ah it it's not and I think that's the danger of\nWell I obviously couldn't agree more uh if you're inclined to call or you go to the website which is just my taxes talked outcome but if you're going to call the number is eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy eight hundred five five six twenty seven\nSeventy they really need your help folks um I don't want to harp on its except we believe in ATF they can't do this without your help they been doing this for years but they can't continue to do it unless we we step up alliance defending\nFreedom album and um we have the number eight hundred and five five six twenty seven Seventy but I guess I Want to say you wanna go to the website everything is doubled as we've been saying so please a check it out\nUm but I got to make a couple of mount Smith I can do it in our too but if we have a second here we do um I just want to say that I wrote an article\nUh it kinda was prompted by what Kanye West set in the White House like two weeks ago or whatever it was\nAnd it's called boys will be men instead of boys will be boys boys will be men and it's at the stream dot org you know where I always send people for guns from Iraq stuff yes\nYeah well now there's a piece that I wrote there it's also on my Twitter feed and on Facebook and we'll we'll plead it out but uh it's I feel very strongly about it I'll probably do they do in a lot of radio and other programs talking about it but next week or maybe I'll talk about it on this program because I feel strongly\nAbout it I've been doing a lot of radio and I just want to say ... yesterday I called up the doctor drew show right they wanted to have me on to talk about Donald a caveman and they started saying like well I don't know if it's a good time to joke around because a lot of the president's opponents are scared\nBecause he has been cited the violent rhetoric and he's inside of this talking about body slamming reporters and what so they they basically are forwarding this narrative\nThat the president's rhetoric is bringing this stuff about it I Want to say I said on the on his program to a doctor drew said\nThat is absolutely unconscionable that you in a prominent place would push forward that that narrative it's it's really yeah or find to me\nBut I'll say on this program I think it's worse than that I think it's despicable that leaders like Dr Drew either to get ratings or whatever it is or saying stuff like that it is it's a stunning it's a stunning thing I just wanted to say that\nThat I was so sick on that radio program I was sorry that I did the interview yeah as obviously I Want to talk about something fun and interesting and they they just wanted to kind of push\nThis this idea I fundamentally disagree with that I Want to say that we're going to go to a break when we come back we're talking about Mormonism do not forget to give to eighty ... go to a tax us talk dot com we'll be right back with Cary Sheffield [noise]\n\nTwenty [noise]\n[noise]\nWell I [noise]\n\nI Need help I've been feeling so low I just need someone to talk to [noise]\n\nNobody understands me I feel so alone [noise]\n\nOr some counseling is here to help our team of license Christian counselor to help you get that we can begin a conversation when you're ready to extra phone or even video conferencing from the comfort of your own home I'd like to give you your first we free to\nTry faithful counseling

takes one weak link for criminals get a\nUh just the full spectrum of information about who the founder was a and I felt really upset I felt like I had been like to I felt like there were ... whitewashing um the origins of the church that\nThey were presenting this this um pristine image of Joseph Smith you and I it took me having to go to the Internet to find out the truth\nAnd it I like to say it's it's sort of like Richard Nixon where the cover up is worse than the crime yeah and what's interesting now is that in the age of the Internet you're seeing the Mormon church actually start to open up more and and they're open up their archives about Joseph Smith uh they're they're studying to be more transparent I think because they've been forced to\nUh and it's sort of that uh you would knock you late them when they're younger so that they don't feel like they're\nRight completely I I thought when I was the worst of it in other words you're you're saying that you were a you were blindsided by what I mean that he had many wives that they were young like what what would you like\nThat like one was fourteen which was really upsetting but also that they were married to other men because they say that oh he only did it because they were widows or they they were never getting married it's like no he basically said if you don't marry me and leave your husband you will be smitten by God and you won't get to have it\nAll the cars they're older me losing me and there's adultery [noise] that's interesting\nI and again\nLook I'm not a member anymore and the church has its own responses and and uh the church uh also will say well he he obviously was a flawed man and he's\nNot or you can kind of stuff whenever you have\nA you know particularly I'm a very very strong leader like you find this in in a religious cult that they start changing the rules and everybody's freaked out and you know it's like you hear these weird things about these people who have this kind of power\nAnd so I don't know very much about chose for but go ahead says oh no and also what\nBothered me was that the book of Mormon and and you can read in the introduction to the book of Mormon they claim that they historically accurate\nFactual document a and that this Smithsonian was using it as\nA guide for ancient history and the Smithsonian issued a letter that said please don't use our name that's not true\nUm because the book of Mormon purports to be the ancient document of a record of Jews who left uh Israel and moved to America um before the coming of Christ and that when Christ died before he rose a or appeared after three days in that three day period you came to America\nAnd that this was an ancient book of the American continent\nDespite the fact that there is there evidence of that and also um the bookworm claims that the Native Americans are actually descendants of\nJews hang on one second we're going to go to a break folks were talking about Mormonism with Cary Sheffield stick around [noise] why\nWould\n\nYou open and shut them nine twenty two year tour [noise] with the sarin\nNews I'm Rhonda roster of the nation wide men on continues as three more

Sheffield who's a writer here in New York City\nThe founder of bowled a and bold T. V. or would she co hosts with Clay Aiken son of a gun okay so you were talking about being I'm Upset learning all these kinds of things what happened after that [noise]\nI uh sadly the way the church is it's very black or white or either you have\nExcept it all uh and really uh be quiet about it a war this was my experience anyway or if you localized your doubts and you try to wrestle with it publicly oftentimes there'll be excommunicated or ostracized and so they really make it a black or white decision\nUm it's really not like Judaism where you could kind of pick your your flavor or at least you're you're manifestation of how you want to practice a and so\nI you know I took the red color or whatever going till I forget the analogy I took the pill\nI decided that I I was going to leave and uh it's sad I think it's sad that they make it such a start\nToy you must have been very tough for your family\nIt was well my parents are are outliers in that sense of they're they're even more fundamentalist\nA than a I mean what I like to say\nWhen Mormonism works out that Mitt Romney Mormon and when it doesn't work out that is a Ralph Sheffield Mormon and I'm\nActually later on when I was an adult my parents actually got excommunicated because there are so fundamentalist uh and so I've been disowned by them after about five years a as a young woman and so that made me incredibly um strong in the end but also at the time incredibly heartbroken\nYeah this is this is tough stuff people don't realize you know when you make a decision for faith or whatever there are huge ramifications um you don't know what's going to happen you think you do you do what what is right you don't know how your family will receive a well what happened after that you went to Harvard and you got involved in politics\nYeah so uh so after I I I I basically skated my last year Brigham Young even though I I was in in the closet doubt or I graduate I got my degree moved to Washington and became a political reporter for the hill politic how is the founding reporter at Politico covering Congress or wrote editorials for Tony Brinkley at the Washington Times\nAnd then I went to Harvard got a full scholarship to study at the Kennedy School of government\nAnd that was right that he business policy and really got interested in economics and after that went to work in finance at Goldman Sachs Moody's a\nAnd it was mentioned you're incredibly brilliant please go ahead\nWell I or that or I just have a hard time sitting still\nI think we're I think probably ... okay\nAnd then I I decided to come by my interest in passions in both finance and politics and a lunch\nBold and you've launched bold TV people want to look at both he'd be where they go\nSure they can check put your browser to W. W. W. dot bold B. O. L. D. dot global G. L. O. B. A. L. there's no dot com and they're stuck on the twentieth century\nVoehl dot global okay All right so what happened that made you politically shift\nWell the thing is I I had always been a pretty conservative politically um the and in fact I wrote editorials for Tony Brinkley who history or work for Newt Gingrich uh and then I you know as people in their early twenties sometimes are I uh was a\nNature of of Jesus in God and yeah right exactly there are lots of things that are ah outside the Bible but so you so much for the core of of Jesus as the son of God that's there's a shared belief there\nThat that and that's what makes it so tricky because I think that there are some Christians who would say I don't care\nOr it's a different Jesus period case closed there are other people would say well God looks on the heart and if you love Jesus\nOr if you really honestly love Jesus and you you know your worshipping him in your heart then it's ... I guess I always look at the Narnia Chronicles do you remember in there where there's this um there's this calorie means kind of like a Muslim\nAnd in his heart he's worshipping as one but he doesn't know the difference between cash and as one and when he sees out when he realizes this is who I have confuses so it's interesting because some people get very theologically\nA precise and other ... so anyway I don't I don't want to go further into that just because we only have a a few minutes but you when you wrote this article you're you're basically looking for an opening of Mormonism I have friends in the Islamic religion saying the same thing like we need to be open otherwise\nWatch you know we've become hide bound and dead and we can't even uh we can't even decide what we believe because if you ask a question people to shut up and of course that happened to the Catholic Church you know about five centuries ago when I wrote a book about it but\nThe last plant in my op ed says that we need a Martin Luther for the Mormon church so ah but I wasn't gonna wait around for that so I left that\nI actually went to a different Christian churches in the DC area for about a year but I left for lots of reasons in part because I didn't I didn't have a direct relationship with God I was confusing religion with the relationship didn't realize that religion is what people do in a relationship with God does\nAnd what did you find that relationship\nI I just last year so that's a mad because they realize what had happened was I had replaced my meaning in life with\nThe gifts rather than the get rid of the guests and I thought that I Would find a deeper purpose in a deeper meaning through public service because that was the here and now that is sacrificing myself for something that I knew for a fact because it's tangible\nAt to me and I actually think that a lot of young people go through this to it and I think that the ... you know the belief in government as a source of higher power or higher meaning I went to the Harvard Kennedy School of government that Kennedy said JFK in many ways became ... you know assassinated and sacrifices himself and\nUm I I my my ... was small limited governor of the conservative type a and then twenty sixteen happened and Trump happened and I was like that it might be [laughter]\nYeah so so I\nHave you ever from that but when he became president did you did you become part of the resistance are part of the the you know what\nNo I wasn't there part of their the since I was I was up to the never Hillary I just could not and policy level agree and for eight more years four more years about Obama type policies and so I was Switzerland in that sense [laughter]\nAnd I say I was never Trump or I wouldn't say to people that all the reasons that Mitt Romney opposed Trump or the same reasons that I oppose Trump's right or the moral problem not having a track record to to ah to look at the ... the fact that he donated to Hillary he wasn't conservative enough for me like a ... all those\nThey are now do you think with with the with the two a Supreme Court nominations and the tax cuts what'd you say that he's more conservative than you thought\nOh absolutely what any delivered a so I'm I'm definitely on the Trump train I plan to vote for him and twenty twenty or you know barring you know unforeseen\nAnd see the actual big one that I had a lot of conservative and Christian friends who said who cares what he says he's not going to do it like you know he says you can do the Supreme Court he's going to nominate his sister hegemony whatever the ... and he said he's going to catch to cut taxes he says ...\nAnd for some reason I thought well you could be right but I don't think so not just something about the way he communicates I think he means this\nAnd so the fact that he uh got Gorsuch in and it looks like Kevin I Will get in and they did the tax cuts and he put the embassy in Jerusalem and he did all these things I thought wow he didn't have to do that you could get elected in and figure out ways not to do that\nUm and you know getting rid of the Iran deal a lot of stuff that he said he would do\nOr that he actually did or has at least try to do I I have to say many many people didn't vote for him because they said he's just talking he's a big talker he'll say anything he needs to say uh

of the passing of his father he felt the freedom to do that\nWell I I don't know what his day to day Sunday participation is like but I Do know over the years uh including when he was running for president because he ran and twenty twelve remember he put his headquarters in Florida not in Utah even though he'd been the governor of Utah but he gave an interview saying things like\nHigh drama inspiration for many faith with which for the bleeding Mormon states that they thought that was weeks off which is why they left Romney over ... been\nYes but then I Can't fall asleep all but I I got to take Ambien so I'm like Judy Garland them up I'm Down I'm I'm a mess oh whoa popping mess oh don't say that\nYeah in in a good way though in a good way um but I guess um I I've always wanted to know what it was like the beauty Garland\nAnd now I Know now you know yeah OK so\nListen I'm over in this\nIn this hour first of all we got we got to announce again what we said in the previous hour we're doing a contest\nThat special contest mhm but before I announced the special contests where you can win a signed copy of a Donald drained the swamp book and who doesn't want one of those they're gonna be collector's items okay now\nI'm going I'm going to tell you how you can win one of those with the contest in just a minute but out and do you mind if I mentioned are friends that he'll feel first\nOh no please do this is why I wanted to mention\nThem because they're the website that we have\nA set up specifically for listeners to this program it's my taxes for Hillsdale dot com Hillsdale they when they educate the students are held because they don't take a penny a federal funds right which is a wild concept but it's like almost no colleges are able to do that they've got an endowment so they are genuinely free\nTo teach about American style self government and liberty they they teach you about American exceptionalism they teach their kids with the constitution means all the stuff that\nNot only is not being taught in many colleges today in most colleges I'm afraid to say what is actively being taught against Hillsdale their champions in this there's very few very few colleges um that uh that understand these issues and teach these issues to their students but the reason we have a website set up my taxes for Hillsdale dot com is that they want\nTo teach these things to the whole world right now they want a everybody who's able to go to that website to access what they're giving other students so the same professors\nTeach college courses that are available online for free these are the actual Hillsdale professors wearing the actual clothes that they were in the classroom that's not a joke\nSo if you're going to taxes for Hillsdale dot com you can find that out there is such good stuff their their their\nTheir champions that I just had to say that All right so now we've got to talk about the contest mhm you mind\nNo no police student was there something that you needed to share with no ... no I think the caveman contest is terrific\nOkay wait here's the thing that in order to get a signed copy of Donald drain the swamp we're gonna make five available so this is only available for the first five people who do this\nA more people can do it but they can enter the contest but only five will order the first five people who dress up whether for Halloween or for all saints eve or whatever you want to call it or just to dress up\nA because not everybody celebrates Halloween because it's the satanic holiday obviously but here's the issue if you dress up in a costume at this time of year and send us a photo of you dressed up as\nDonald the caveman but first by people who sent us those photos will get a signed copy of Donald drain the swamp so you can go to info at Eric my taxes dot com or you can go to our Web sites whatever however you get it to us\nUm this'll be up to election day but the first five automatically get a signed copy of Donald brings a swamp automatic\nYeah automatic that's great what the best one\nAnd by the way you should probably be holding a copy of Donald drain the swamp a you know in in the photo I Would I Would recommend that but let me say that I'm the best photo will get three signed copies of the book\nAnd everybody when we send a book we also send you a he's my caveman ... sticker and he's my caveman campaign button and those are big and beautiful there like three and a quarter inches across a really nice beautiful buttons\nOr that they eat my caveman and the sticker at the same thing so we are we're saying that that is the first by people who do this is who gets a picture of them dressed in a costume look you could do it today and in fact I I wouldn't I Would rush because the the first\nFive that's it they're not the only example of get an automatic signed book but\nThe the winner the best photo of all we get three sign books three stickers three buttons ... at the first five just get one clear\nYeah and that's clear so find the caveman bathroom and get in there and change into your caveman colorized whom\nYes right um [noise] uh so I just I just wanted to announce that 'cause 'cause it's Halloween is fun it over time could\nBe as you know it's time to have fun and dressing up as Donald ... man as long as you don't do that in the wrong neighborhood you know where you where you could get a\nYou know owned or something I had a in a storm labor than in the United states of America that was\nReally fun thing to do a follow wiener for a party or whatever it is so I just want to throw that out there good um I also want to say you want to talk about a hair in food\nOr no yes please do you you mentioned this and I ... off the welfare and I was like last night yeah

can electronically read your humble business of unwanted rodents and pass\nThat's not America in America we have the right to disagree on these sensitive issues let's let's just ban is not everybody can agree on same sex marriage that's okay but to criminalize your views I mean look\nPeople like you and me who are Christians you know we believe in the devil we think that Halloween is not a great thing to be celebrated we think we have a lot of use it a lot of people just think we're crazy\nBut you know what we're entitled to her crazy views in America everybody's entitled to their view is whether you think it's crazy or do you agree\nBut now we have the state saying not only don't we liked the way you think we're going to enforce it so you can't think that way so the idea that alliance defending freedom has to step up with its great lawyers and say we're going to have to go to court\nAnd this goes all the way the Supreme Court when was it heard at the Supreme Court\nSo it was argued December yeah go ahead\nGo ahead Jack [noise] you know you go ahead and it was like nobody I Know in December the fifth December the fence okay it\nSince I was Seventeen so almost a year ago we went to Washington DC it's on the court Ruth ginsburg Gorsuch Kennedy Roberts Alito all of them\nAnd it was the other two let's be clear with the seven to two decision seven to two\nOkay now this is a big thing I Want to say that again are we in America need to understand and this was a seven to decision meaning that the Supreme Court\nIs not you know divided always divided or ideological here politically whatever seven of the nine Supreme Court justices said the jak\nPhilips has a constitutional rights had been violated so this is where we are in the country is that even though seven of the two Supreme Court justices\nAgreed the Jack was wrong and\nYou still have to fight these legal battles it still has to be argued an argument argued 'til you can get it to the Supreme Court and by the grace of God they ruled correctly but it's an amazing thing most Americans think that well if it's right or wrong you'll be figured out right away no the state of Colorado gets this totally wrong you guys have to argue with all the weight Supreme Court what would that cost\nA match sharp in legal bills if alliance defending freedom doesn't exist\nAnd somebody who has a little cake shops as a okay I guess I'm gonna have to fight this now so I don't get run out of business I mean what would that cost just for this one case all the way the Supreme Court\nTo take a case like this is the Supreme Court you're looking at hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney time and fees and all of this involved because you have multiple arguments um the preparation for it and everything and and it's\nUm best part of my job is that we're able to look at someone like jak a hero and say you know what we're going to stand with you and we're going to do it free of charge to you all the way\nWell I mean of course to go to the Supreme Court you're not going to get an average lawyer to argue from Supreme Court this is a big deal this is a big deal and everything's riding Idaho person's life reputation\nYour whole business jak Philips I mean this is when you're talking hundreds and hundreds of thousand dollars that's your business you're you're going to go out of business and so what are the lines of printing freedom do they do it\nFor free and that is why I have you on the program right now because I Want my listeners to understand that\nThis most basic thing that will be happening all across America if we don't fight it because if there's no price to pay more and more people are going to try this kind of stuff to shut you down because they think you're a big
