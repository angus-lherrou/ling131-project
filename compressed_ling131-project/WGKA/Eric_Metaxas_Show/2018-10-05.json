requires something else this has to be your issue\nAnd if it's not your number one issue that you are in fact just the Democrat who loves guns and as I said there's nothing wrong with that lots of Democrats love gun or something else is more important to them and I use the example maybe it's global warming maybe it's rosy way whatever it is\nOn their platform there's something there that's more important using done that's why you are willing to love your gun and still pull the lever for Brock Obama or Hillary Clinton who you know want to take away your guns or maybe your congressional representative or senator who you know wants to take away your guns\nSo to me I don't have that I don't have that dilemma I sleep well at night I Love my guns and I know who I pull the lever for also loves my ... take a listen to this email mark your show discussing how a Democrat can be pro Second Amendment really got me thinking\nYou see I'm a gun loving conservative trade union member so I knew exactly where this email was going a moment I saw that I knew exactly where this letter writer was going let's let's check it out you see I'm a gun loving conservative trade union member\nThere are many of us out there we speak quietly among ourselves about America's current issues are rights with the left is doing to America however\nWe also hear what are the love of conservative Republican Party hates our right to collective bargaining for retirement\nHealthcare and for a great wage with that great wage I pay for without government help my son's college for my latest firearms bark we're put between a rock and a hard place when there are politicians out there that will support my right to collective bargaining\nBut nothing else I stand for you mean the Democrat\nSo if there is a politician that will stand up for my Second Amendment rights in my right to collective bargain I'll give him a second thought for my vote\nIt's the same issue I have with my conservative brothers on the radio embrace the union Brotherhood regardless of the leadership and see how many more votes will come to the right side\nGun rights union brother thank you wow that's a great email for lots of different reasons here's my response to sit down and talk to the politician that has the our next to them\nThat you think doesn't support your right to collective bargain I think what you're gonna find is that you're being sold a bill of goods by big money pack and a Democrat Party trying to scare you wave I've never met a Republican politician that hated\nOr trade union member hey here's a motto I Love this right skilled labor isn't cheap and cheap labor as unskilled\nI Believe that with all my heart I Know lots of people in the trades and there's truth to that\nThe unions have changed over the years the guy did battle with the Teamsters way back in the day I'm Talking about the mid eighties early eighties when I first got out of college and went to work\nFor a trucking company it was a non union company it was over I transportation but later took a position in the late eighties in Philadelphia tough union town with St john's very trucking remember St john's very trucking some of you probably do\nSome of you might even remember their motto but Satan outlet you send me an email market armed American radio dot org if you remember St john's varies motto I'll be more than happy to read it on the air\nBut they were union carrier it was a real culture shock for me to go from a non union carrier to a union carrier I read and it was propaganda coming to these drivers in the form of the teams are magazine every week I read this stuff and say we're in the world\nIs coming from because I was management I had grievances he filed on me before I did the whole mediation\nThing and rooms I've I I did I went toe to toe with the shop for me because I Would go out riding with the drivers and I get a stern Yellen before when I don't you touch any free if you touch any freight you're taking a man's job\nWhen in reality every driver I ever went with as soon as we got in the truck and started moving because you are going to help me out right\nIt was propaganda now a lot has changed since those days a lot has changed since those days but here's my suggestion don't believe what you see at the top go sit down and make an appointment and talk to that representative whether it's local\nIt's your congressman state or federal whether it's your senator make an appointment when they're in the district and talk to them about your concern I think you'll be very very surprised at what you hear\nRemember people have to tow the line politically we're witnessing that right now with Kavanaugh by the way funny how we're not talking about Kavanaugh today right that's by design profit pick that conversation up again on friday\nBut I Know a lot of politicians letter writer you don't put your name on so I Can't address your by name and I won't give your email address out obviously so I just want to say that and again there's a lot of meat to this I Wish I had more time to cover this you say there are many of us out there oh I Know there are\nBelieve me I Know there and I understand\nThe rock and a hard place that you might find yourself in and I also know that you speak quietly quietly among yourself because I get hundreds of emails like this believe it\nBut you talk about current issues you talk about what the left is doing to America with some how you feel God I've got a vote this way for this very reason no I don't know who the politician as you're talking about I don't know where you live\nSo it's hard to address it specifically if you want to write me back and let me know those things I Would be more than happy to carry on a really nice private conversation with you and I'm gonna betcha I'll bet you ten bucks on national radio that we can fix\nWhatever perception or problem there\nIs if we get our heads out of the media\nBecause I Know you're a gun lover and guess what I Believe based on what I read here and how I read it you don't want anybody taking your firearms either\nBut you've written a book you've written so many wonderful books and here I'm holding in my hand another one the title of it and Jesus is ribs and\nPaul in the early church you did not used to be a Christian and you certainly did not used to be a Christian author you live you you dove into this thing almost like you believe that\nYeah yeah uh interesting I've always\nSo enjoyed our interviews because you bring up things that no one else does that wasn't one up\nThat was that when I asked my points now but you know what I Want to know seriously you are you you said this on the program before before my listeners people just tuning in how did you you're a lawyer how did you come to faith what happened\nI was a skeptic as you mentioned and but I was a seeker I I always believe in God that I didn't embrace the God of the Bible didn't embrace Jesus Christ didn't really believe that an all loving God would allow people to suffer a much less a turtle damnation and all that\nAnd um I finally started studying it reading apologetic books Paul Little um you know Josh ... del Norman guys are and I finally uh overcame my so called intellectual doubts\nAnd then I later place my faith in Christ but I\nI just I I don't understand how anyone can think that there isn't a God I mean Romans one I don't understand you know that you look at the creation you look at the ah you look at everything I Know the cynics can point poke holes and all of that but if they have an open mind they will understand\nBut but embracing without a Bible was a little difficult and what I didn't realize is that people had placed seeds in my path all along when I didn't realize it until after I became a believer little things that if they hadn't happened if God in it\nI wouldn't hadn't put people in my past dropping those seats I may not have become a Christian of course I was always destined to be one because God I I don't I'm not ...\nCause you believe in their predestination guard I actually don't but I Move on you know whatever I don't wanna get into that but but usually you ... I just want to see how how you were raised because how many how many kids when your family just rush and I just you and Russell [laughter]\nCan I call him Russ Russ un Russ where they were just two kids know how many years apart are you to have you now this is beyond it have you always been two years apart yes it's amazing you see that's very rare\nIt is that's very very rare of fluids elated that it was just the two boys you all you're like me and my brother we're we're about two years apart and uh I guess my question is did you go to any kind of church on Sunday oh yeah yeah we were raised in Methodist Church in what in what part of the state were part of the country\nThe southeast Missouri okay so you went to church so you didn't think it was a bunch of bologna\nNo no no no in my parents were Christians and and I I I just not like I was cynical about it I just I had trouble with it I didn't understand how it was there and all that\nBut but when I was going to tell you a minute ago when you so rudely cut me yes I always try to cut people off rudely otherwise what's the point yeah but what was that I hadn't really given it a chance it's like okay so I'm passing\nJudgment on a thing that affects my eternal life might turn a turtle destiny with without having exam with it for myself when I did examine that I was amazed at what I've found Web but that's but that's quite recently right yeah well no no no twenty five years ago but I didn't\n... but it's still quite ... you're a kid right so you're a little bit like me in the sense that you were really were absolutely an adult before you really look ... like where did you go to college I'm a zoo ms ooh yes and then you went to to law school at ... ...\nAnd then you left into a career as a lawyer what kind of law where you practicing all this time\nThe general practitioner until I got an entertainment log with the luck of having my brother who asked me to do the contracts and various other people whose names I won't\nMention wouldn't it be great to have a brother who was a lawyer\nYeah my name or Russ [noise] and\nI had a brother like you or I probably would be a lot richer today actually I probably would have some money but let me ask you that you're a lawyer you're moving along in life as an adult you get married you have kids but at what point did something happened where you said I Need to know\nIs God real I guess I'm I'm guessing you around you know late thirties or something it probably mid thirties and my wife was a Christian I Can't believe she married me why would she marry you know we're not supposed to be an equally yoked so your wife send by marrying\nYou totally incredible yeah and uh but that she was patient and she feels she said she always knew I Would become a Christian um but but I I really did um I went to this prayer breakfast where\nOr when I Can't remember the St Louis cardinal pitcher was speaking and gave an impassioned speech that that really didn't move me they less cars at the end of the speech saying if you want to learn more about this sign up and it was Christian men's business conference or whatever it's called\nAnd so we some people call me we haven't got together in a small group we went through this book called the first steps which talked about the authenticity of the Bible or the divinity and\nThe fact that you were willing to go to that see that's interesting because a lot of people lose their name and I want to but you put yourself in that position at ... that's that's interesting did you have a sense that I mean what what were you think I'm always curious because I remember my own journey and you try to remember what was in my head\nWas in your head at that time did you think this may be true and it's important I'm going to have a family here I Need to think about this what was going through your head of that time\nUm I I really wanted to believe that but I thought it it it just didn't all the pieces didn't come together I thought the Christians were good I didn't\n... some of them I thought were scolds 'em and gold and off putting blue blue nose school yeah those kind and those kinda people ought to know that that's not great witness that is\nGreat ... ... yes yes I Know exactly who you're talking about in fact I'll give you their names [laughter] oh man they're the worst the worst yeah\nAnd uh they mean well or not and but but I I just I I wanted so much to leaving I Can't wait until I read these things out that makes sense that it's got to be true but then then I go back to get back alone no can't be true and uh but then I kept at it and I I really was a pretty Arden seeker and I finally became\nA believer that for yeah because I knew it was urgent but you know when you're younger you think are immortal or at least you don't have any urgency about the end of your life right\nSo but I didn't have any those urgency but I just knew it was time to get with it\nIsn't that interesting yeah and ... was this around the time that that you if you had been married at the end yeah did you have any kids yet\nYou know it's interesting though because there are certain people in life you come to a point where you start thinking ... ... it looks like I'm about to cross the starting line I got to get serious here this is there's it's not just preamble I'm getting out of the race way yes and I I just find it interesting that so here you are an adult\nAnd you somehow ... I Can't just blew there were long I Can't just stumble along I actually needed to think about this and figure out whether it's true uh but for for most people living in the culture in which we live there's so much there's so much evidence seemingly against it is\nBut you know what amazes me amazes me is I see people walking around oblivious even to the question in curious and just automatically assume that that it is it true and I find myself looking back wondering why I wasn't more urgent about it because it is so uh so Syria I\nThink because ignoring it uh is easier when we come back folks I Will continue my conversation with the brother of Ross\nAre USS Limbaugh not to be confused with rush or or maybe it's Russia ... David Limbaugh is in the in the studio along with his daughter this is so great the book is Jesus is risen stick around\n\nSome I Am now ... the I\nMean\nI'm Still fearful I feel like my world is about to come crashing down around the ... I Can't even get to sleep at night this constant dread is wearing down I Can't put my finger on it nothing actually wrong I'm just telling settled [noise] I don't know what to do [noise]\n\nI just wanted to stop I Want to feel normal [noise]\nTo counseling is here to help our team of license Christian counselors would have helped me get through this\nWe can begin a conversation when you're ready I text your phone or even video conferencing from the comfort of your own home I'd like to give you your first week free to try fateful counseling dot com let's talk do right now to try faithful counseling dot com we really want to help you I mean it's so easy to get started and your first\nWeek is ... go now to try faithful counseling dot com let us help\nIn the day were Hollywood celebrities left wing media and even big mobile companies in swing elections and wind up your rights to evade family and the freedom to bear or this is the time for you\nTo stand up and fight to switch to a patriot mobile and get nationwide reliable service with unlimited talk into for less money and no hidden the sender us based member services deem provides excellent service was patriot\nMobile automatically donates a portion of your bill to the conservative causes your voting to protect the pure number bring your own device or selected new ones they offer many Android an iPhone model starting out only four dollars a month for limited it's great to know your cell phone company supports conservative causes you believe that make\n[noise] I Love it you know I mean everybody's path is different and it's so fascinating to me but I I Want to encourage everybody who's listening\nAnd this is not for other people this is for you would see the true or it's not and if it's true\nBy the way you can only bless you there are people I think they have this fear is gonna bears me it's going to make me lives like that as absolute garbage I Want to date that clearly\nThat is garbage if you think that believing in Jesus will make you into a weird person it'll only make you into a weird person if you want to be ... percent but honestly\nIf you want to be who you are supposed to be you know if you want to get to your grave uh always wondering who might really supposed to be well then you can avoid God but God is kind of like the gas in the tank cars and go anywhere without gas in the tank and I just want to say to people you know who find themselves in a position like you\nTo say honestly the idea that this is scary in some way is a total lie\nIn and picking up on that I I think there's a there's a lot of paradoxes in Christianity in my view and I talked about some of them in one of the books but I think some some of this ... Christian\nHad this fear that Christians don't have fun they don't enjoy life there like I said they're ... they're they're regimented the robotic they don't they don't live a real life and if they do is just to be goody goody isn't the kind of people you wouldn't wanna hang around with not because you ...\nEnjoy just because they're they're not happy people for some of the kind that I'm not so there are a bunch\nOf well I I Know I can give you named after the show\nOkay [laughter] but but what I didn't understand until later I began to study it I said how can you reconcile this idea that Christianity gives you a liberty Paul talks about um ... it it'll set you free ... believe in Christ in such for what okay here's here's the answer that paradox\nBefore you become a Christian\nYou are a slave to send it is your master\nI don't mean that kind of sin your terrible person all we're all deprived but I'm not in just vernacular flavor macular I'm not saying if you're a terrible person may be a very nice for it but you're a slave to that kind of lifestyle in his it has dominion over over you when\nYou accept Christ is your personal savior\nYou are a liberated from sin and you become a slave to Christ now what does that mean that that that doesn't mean you're free ... and Paul addresses these cars that me and I'm Free to sin\nNo emphatically no it means you're now a slave to Christ slave I don't want to be a slight know what you understand that you been out of love and the ... you want to even raised yourself to a higher standard of morality\nOr out of obedience and love for Christ and and what it all means but you're not bound to you're not living under arbitrary not are not living under the the set of rules they transcend that Christ goodness and love\nA transcends all that and you want to be a ... and you're no longer safe descent\nAnd that that I Want to follow up with this when we come back folks were talking to David Limbaugh brother of Russell and uh this

in totally agree with those skills and so those are two I'll mention right now um okay so so anyway we're getting getting back to the to the book here\nYou are you talk specifically about Paul in the early church what what drove you to write this\nOkay the last book I wrote ... last Christian themed book I wrote was about the gospels and I consolidated them into one heritage chronological narrative and had an ongoing commentary through those\nUh and it was a paraphrase and sometimes verbatim account of every verse and the gospels\nAnd I I my goal was awfully familiar rise people with the gospels it hadn't been heretofore\nAnd to help them understand what it means because when I started this then this is true this book to I don't want to promote the other book I'm promoting this book shamelessly but the same thing applies to both and that is when I finally realized that I was holding in my hand the word of God\nOr I Want to ask you to help alliance defending freedom I Know

twenty seven Seventy that's eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy I'll repeat that at the end of the show I Want to go back to a day but you were talking about going through the scripture what you've done in your book so this is the new one Jesus has risen Paul in the early church you are effectively\nEntertaining the scripture another's you're doing a Bible commentary even though you you you're presenting it as a popular book because it is a popular book\nBut the point is that you're also doing a Bible\nCommentary you're helping people because and by the way that is biblical people always say well that's the word of God there's nothing about the word of God well by the way in the word of God says uh unless somebody explains it to you how you going to understand that you need somebody who gets it to help you understand what it says if you just open up the Bible start reading a lot of people are going to get stuck I\nGot stuck you need somebody to help you and that's what your books are doing\nExactly thanks for staying I saw a guy and Twitter somebody promoted my book on Twitter and some Senate comes on there no thanks I I got the Bible that's all I Know that's not all you need but we have Sunday school teachers by the way\nBut can you can you imagine we just got to say like the level of of foolishness that is on social media there are people that advertise their idiocy there the whole world to see and is this religious\nSpirit when they say I got the Bible like wait a second are you telling me that you shouldn't read anything but the Bible exactly but there are people will say that thing and and guess what in the Bible in\nAct okay Paul is in in in Athens okay preaching to the Athenians what does he do he quotes pagan poets in the scripture absolutely okay so this this idea you can't even escape pagan poets when you read the word of God\nSo folks that that's going to challenge some people the logically but I'm not challenging you the Bible is challenging you mean\nBy the way he he he cited pagan poets not only to show that he was learned but to relate because he he said I become all things to all people don't sweat the small things I'm going to uh relate to people whoever I have an july's because I can get into their\nAh into their framework and they'll listen to me if I Know something about their world you don't compromise you don't delete the gospel that's not what he did at least I'm not going to sweat the small stuff I'll allow us to be certain things he said you you guys believe in God\nBut what about the let me tell you about the living God and so he explained to so get talked to people in their own terms that as an evangelist an apologist so\nUh but I Would I think and then you hit on something else\nI have a lay platform I I'm not a theologian I'm not a pastor but I've studied a lot in my life the Bible and and theology\nMy adult life and I feel like I was calling to share what I've learned with people who are similarly situated ... ... ... people are not quite there as Christians and Jews and Christians who uh who who want to learn more about the Bible who who are hungry to learn\nBecause I think I can relate to these people in a way that pastors and theologians can't\nThey talk to people on their level and and other levels but they don't most of them don't know what it's like to be a skeptic wants their hearts\nI always wanted but that's exactly right and that's why I write a lot of what I write because I remember vividly what it's like Disney Christians are not somebody I Want to be I remember vividly what it's like\nTo think they think they've got all the answers they're idiots I remember that to viscerally yes and so I feel a passion to reach people who think that way right now but as I say I know what's going through your head I was\nOne of you and I think that it's important for folks like us\nTo write books like this so I I Want to say thank you

you've got in because I find that very interesting when you said that you just when you really discovered that the Bible\nIs the word of God now a lotta times Americans we say the word of God and I think we lose a lot of people because the heck does that mean\nWord capital W word the Greek word is logos\nSo when we say the word of God I often think the Protestants evangelicals kind of get it wrong 'cause we're so focused on word as word that we're missing that there's a bigger piece to it the logos to say the word of God\nIs more than the words of God it's a one wonderful thing to say these are this is this is God's word and these are the words of God but to understand that it's just fused with the divinity and got himself it's a fused with\nWith the presence of God and apart from that it's not the word of God writes just a bunch of black marks on a page and a minor bird or a parrot could speak the word have gotten it ceases to be the word of God right\nThis is the greatest country in the history of the world not because I say so not because I'm a great now because your great but because\nThe ideas behind this country or a gift from God to the whole world we are stewards of these ideas of self government and freedom and basically uh\nWe have to take that seriously it's like somebody gives you an extremely valuable object worth a ... so much money is so fragile you you can't say that it's not mine I don't care that they've given it to you even trusted with it you need to take it seriously and I think that\nWe have to take what we have seriously and and part of that means we have to understand how it works and so what's been going on with the Kavanaugh nomination a\nHas been depressing because people I'm On the Democratic side of the aisle traditionally have played by certain rules and I think somehow they feel now they no longer can play by those rules because there's so much at stake\nI'm that's bad for everybody it's bad for them it's bad for the whole country so I'm asking you if you're listening to this right now\nPray for this country now people we always say that pray for the ...\nI mean genuinely pray when there's a commercial or when you have a second say a prayer whether you're in a car wherever you are say a silent prayer or spoken allowed prayer for this nation for this confirmation process because this is dark stuff right now we're we're talking about\nWhat a man did or didn't do when he was Seventeen years old whether he got drunk or whatever I think wow this is this is madness has descended on America and then when the G O P ... relent to pressure and says okay we'll drag this out again will have the ... of an FBI probe\nOf course Feinstein and others say oh it's not the right kind of ... not deep enough it's not brought enough which really means that they won the latest forever and they're using every political advantage you have to see it for what it is folks you've got to see it for what it is\nBut it's it's as nasty and unpleasant as anything I have ever seen a and so I Want to ask people pray a pray for Kavanaugh but more than that pray for the country please pray for this country that we could heal and that people who are naked lead part is in\nA would would understand that we have certain standards that we have to abide by no matter what that's my ...

built into who can be a commissioner so right there it's it's so that I said it and they set that up that's right\nAnd and so that's how it set up so of course they're coming after people like Jack

cannot complain when they're going to they will come after you are somebody because this is how nasty as if you say the wrong thing they're coming after you and so alliance defending freedom you guys

clients chief Calvin\nCochran I'm One of the things I Want to say and I was just reminded by Anne Marie Paris so who's sitting here silently she has no my phone by her choice but she just made the point that the reason\nOr ATF exists it it's not that there aren't lawyers that can be hired to defend people like a ... the chief here or a jak Philips but the costs are huge you guys do this for free\nFor free because you believe this is the right thing and you know\nThat if you don't do it for free most of the people being persecuted cannot afford to going to lose their homes trying to fight these insane battles and these activists on the other side who are really they are genuine hate groups\nThey know that and they know that they can take advantage of the legal system and they can make people pay you can lose your job you can lose your house you can lose your reputation just because we don't like the way you think\nSure and and how does a person like the chief go up against the the city of Atlanta that has a budget like the size of a third world country or the state of Washington for Baron Hill stuff's better Colorado I mean you simply cannot be done and you talk about these cases the chief case has been going on for four or five years who knows what it'll end\nUm these cases have gone to the Supreme Court you're looking at an easy million dollars plus per case of depending on how when they take and no one could afford something like that which is why we have the pleasure of coming alongside the cheap and all these good people who are just living out their faith and and and just getting bullied by by the\nHour that you use the word I mean they're they're being bullied and sense of people saying like you know we have the power to shut you up\nAnd we're going to shut you up you you want to lose your job you want to lose your house you want to lose it you better shut up and if you don't shut up we're going to come after you and so they're making\nA point of going after people specifically to threaten everybody else so that everybody has a little better shut up now I Want to say to my listeners too if you shut up your coward okay you cannot shut up because when you shut up\nYou were helping them to bully innocent people so we we all have to speak up and I think that people of faith particularly in this country we have this false view that ... being a person the fake means uh that\nHave to agree with everybody and get along with everybody you can love people and disagree with them\nAnd this idea that we shouldn't fight I mean barn Hoffert
