Second Amendment not shed innocent blood all the things that go with it so we no longer teach those responsibilities as as a consequence when you look around America constitutionally to vote in America\nAccording to constitution you just got to be Eighteen years or older that's it now we have one more statutory requirements they will\nGo ahead and register so we make sure there's only want to be voted out and voted are Ken voted for you or whatever and so at this point we have only sixty seven point one percent of adults in America rich ... so one third of already checked out and said we don't care what happens in the nation we're not that they had anything that's not our responsibility\nAnd then you get two presidential elections like we had two years ago and since Nineteen eighty the average voter turnout is fifty four percent of registered voters\nWell that's only thirty eight percent of total adults voting and it only takes ... and ... percent\nSo since Nineteen eighty one out of five Americans just choosing the press from the United states went out of five lost and three out of five decided that nothing and then when you get to elections like we are right now and this year\nYou look at the average since Nineteen eighty and it is like thirty nine percent of registered voters who wrote and thirty nine percent of six seven percent which is at twenty six percent half of that could choose the winner\nWe're looking at one out of eight Americans that will choose US Senators ... shoes are US Congressman that let's use our governors and state Senate state ... ... s on believable\nThat only one out of eight is choosing and that's because we don't see this as a responsibility anymore and people have ... about ... or where it's going to look in the mirror us first place to start\nWhat do you mean to make a difference who you're going in for what value your cold will you vote for me constitutions that huge issue\nAnd it's a matter of fact I look at the Capitol hearings we should never have had a fiasco like that back in the original ... the day the George Washington John Adams and Madison dominate got at the Supreme Court they were sitting on the Supreme Court they than confirm and made all the same day\nBut now we've allowed jak just become almost like the press and the United states they make policy so when you look at a confirmation ouch like looking at a presidential campaign I mean it's all the money to spend all the attacks on ads and everything that's not what the constitution design and so for me getting judges on the court they actually go back to reading that document\nAnd actually understanding they're not a super legislature\nThat's a huge deal for me but the only way I'm going to get that ... people in the standard issue and found those kind of just make sure we believe that direction and so that's and that's what we really ought to be motivated enough to have a responsibility to have a duty in a sense of Kobe\nBut where we are in America right now and we've just really given the nation away to apathy andme are letting again like Houston two percent of the people choose to go there and twenty six states that ...\nI Wish more or less I Wish you were wrong David but I Know you're right this is going to go on the front lines of freedom and we're talking about being good citizens with David Barton they were close out of time\nIt's voting time I challenge people not to vote stupid I always get within hours or Democrat always produce somebody else gives me a list and I just go down I find most citizens couldn't name five elected officials they voted for up to thirty or forty they couldn't vote for\nWe're not being good stewards we're not paying attention yeah sure I Would give us a final call to action to get out and vote this November\nEverything's electronic a day and that is so easy to I'd have to make sure any candidate you can get a ballot ahead of time\nYou will be focused on here you senator is all you're getting your City California at all the gas it pretty government where you live\nOr things like voter guide dot com as information on the positions of candidates and so it is so easy to find out who's on the ballot at a sample ballot go ahead and look them all up and take you longer you look at the single ... as the candidate so that that go through their positions cash and they're going to vote I mean if you don't like the direction America is going to you do\nYour the steward of it and so get out there to get the information there is no reason at this age not to know or any candidate stands for not to know all the candidates on your ballot that takes maybe thirty minutes and doing that every two years is certainly more time if you want to see the mission preserved\nAmen brother David how can people stay in touch with you I'm sure you've got some website or something where they can stay in touch with what you're doing\nWhen do we have a website called wall builders dot com it's from the Bible because in the in the sense of rebuilding that which is torn down or shoot citizen call but that's what we advocate so all voters dot com lots of resources lots of history lots of ... studies\nDavid thank you so much for taking time to join us today thank you for your strong position to make America as strong as it should be a protocol your

it's time to meet bruise your Gabriel a terrorism expert and chairman of act for America the largest national security grassroots organization in the U.S and the author of a new book wise it's about the defense of Judeo Christian values and freedom in our nation welcome to freedom\nBridget colonel I'm delighted to be with you ... give us a little bit about your background one doesn't become a terrorism expert by going to the local university and I know you grew up in a culture is very different than the one room now\nI did and that's actually what shaped me to be who I Am today I Am not only an expert on carry him but I mean I wouldn't have to care who lived to tell about it I was born and raised in Lebanon with he used to be the only majority Christian country in the middle east\nAnd fortunately as the Muslim it became the majority are they declared war on the Christians and started killing us my nine eleven happened\nThe in Nineteen Seventy five one radical Islam is a back to my home blowing it up Britain bring me under the rubble one did and um I ended up in a hospital for two and a half months\nAnd as I laid a colonel in a hospital bed going from one surgery to another that's my father why did they do this to us and my father was telling me because we are Christians and Muslims consider us infidels and they want to kill us\nSo I learned since I was at ten year old little girl that I Am ... dead simply because I was born into the Christian faith and lived in a Christian town\nI ended up leaving the hospital and coming back home to my home was no longer the home my left\nWe ended up ... a ... thing and a bomb shelter underground in a very small eight by ten room\nWe didn't have any electricity they didn't have water we didn't have any food to get some food with call out under the bombs and we lived out dandelions and different vegetation that girl rather a bomb shelter and because it was the only greenery we had to eat I took that some water I Lived in a town called Marja you and valley of springs\nAnd to get some water with curled to a nearby spraying under snipers bullets used to take a five minute walk state powers crawling in a ditch\nAnd every time we left the got some water we would say oh I left goodbyes because we did not know if we're going to come back alive or dead just to get a drink of water and this became my existence and I live in that bomb shelter from the age of ... the age of Seventeen Rob the my youth\nCertainly you didn't study anything you experience that this is all life situation\nI Lived it that you know people ask me how did you go to school\nAnd I said well mom the way I got the school I was transported you know a tank and military tank you know obviously you're a colonel you know they'll stay for the big cannon in the front you can put a pink children in that tank\nAnd many times under the bombing we went for two years we didn't go to school to finally The Elders in our town decided you know we've got to educate the kids we don't know how long this is going to laugh\nSo I remember going to school for one year where they squeezed in two years and want so we can catch up with our studies\nAnd many that that would be picked up the school or but that sounds cool on one of those big banks are because of the bombing and I remember many days that principle running through the hallways of the school screaming get ready to leave we're gonna bomb that going to stop falling in ten minutes because they would hear something on the radio that they do the bombing of going to start\nAnd this became my life that's how I went to school\nAnd as a mother in America when I look at my children and the different lives that they leave and even though we think in America we have problems and we we we we have challenges and\nYou know a lot of people in our country gets so tied up and so passionate about different issues and I think back on the way I grew up and how many other\nPeople across the world what they're dealing with the right now and I've got to put things in perspective you know how far to the to the art to live in America despite all the challenges despite all the bickering that we do between Republicans and the Democrats and [laughter] you know whatever we have problems in our country we are still living and the best country in the world\nWe are indeed that's a very critical point this is going to go on for months of freedom and we're discussing the sending in understanding our values is Gabriel was that's totally\nRight on we don't appreciate how much we haven't made I don't think we understand the ... the radical Islamist environment an attitude that is a real threat to us today here in America is\nIt is a real threat and this is what I detail in my book rise and I titled the book rise a rise in defense of Judeo Christian values and freedom because I Want it to light a fire under Americans to understand why we are facing and how smart our enemy is\nAnd how they have evolved from and the way they were on nine eleven when we were attacked on nine eleven two thousand and one we were only worried about I'll ... I'll guide it was the big name apart and we put up and we said if we just eliminated all ... all our problems are going to disappear\nAnd we were misled by President Bush was saying as long as their religion of these I'll guide as our enemy if we just defeat al Qaida that radicals everything is going to be great\nWell here we are Seventeen later and we only had ... we had I simply don't have ISIS thankfully President Trump eliminated most of their territories\nBut you've got Boko Haram in Nigeria we've got left car type in India inside of Syria and Libya obviously ISIS in Iraq and Syria and Lebanon even Hamas in Gaza rattled out the alphabet soup of different the sonic terrorist organizations operating around the world that most Americans some of them have never even heard about\nWhat we do with is an ideology but the way our enemy became smarter colonel and this is what I detail in my book cries is they went from a militant movement to attack America hijacking airliner the flight and the skyscrapers\nAnd to now as stealth operation in my book I have a chapter titled the leftist Islamist coalition\nAnd I talk about how the left in our country right now is working with the radical Islamic organizations in our country\nOur clothes and human rights organizations like the American Islamic Relations care or is that the Islamic society of North America oh Linda for ...\nFor those who were watching television the last couple of weeks and had seen what happened with the Kevin I hearing and the sad fact is that we wouldn't stop on Capitol Hill\nHe only seen the leftist activist paid by some rows\nAnd Bush elected officials and elevators that what they did with flake what oh so you have seen people like Linda ... who was an Islam is the activists with her family members and writing in Israeli jails convicted on terrorism\nHere she's an activist working hand in hand with the Democratic party with democratic elected officials have been a critic activists\nFunded by sorrows or the Muslim go hard working with the ACLU Planned Parenthood Saddam barbecue Law Center move on dot org and the resistance movement that such on the left and together right now they're working against America to sabotage America from within\nI Wish you were wrong I Wish I had some kind of argument against that I have many friends who are Muslims but I don't see any Muslims protesting Islamic terror and I think it's because they're afraid of being attacked themselves is this kind of society we want here\nWell this is not in a society that we want to hear and they are not afraid because if there was ever place in the world where people can come out and speak truthfully and forcefully about what's going on in the United states you're protected you're not going to have\nPeople coming in jail they're not going to have people torturing you you can organize rallies you can demonstrate\nAnd we have seen Muslims are very active in the community and the local communities\nBut actually one of the other side active by telling their community members do not talk to the FBI do not get it for the FBI and then I talked to any first responders or anybody asking questions and the health care and care at thirty first care standing for the comes to an American Islamic Relations\nSo it's a matter of fear as a matter of basically I'm speaking out if they speak out there speaking out against the ideology but where is this ideology base it is based in the car so for the moderates within our own country to come out and speaking of the nation\nOf radical Islamic terrorism bill practically almost condemning the profit because the prophet Muhammad ... exactly what these people are doing\nWhat I said well I'll tell you what the what the radicals are doing\nThey are basically following the command months of the ... and to the letter\nAnd this is something that the Islamic lobby in the United states with the help of President Obama for the last eight years have been very successful and blinding the American public and intimidate the American public actually discuss it truth behind the comic terrorism\nLooks obviously is a great deal more to talk about who's ... which is going to stay with us we're talking about disarming our nation and our values this is going to do much for them to just push up time I want you to a hundred and three pushups somebody I Do every

stands across the field from the brass and we have plenty of room between us and them\nWe were there are several days before graduation so we were practiced on the various fields around West Point in our own sort of made up uniform we decided that if we ask permission to do our thing and they said no\nWhen we were done so we just did it we marsh out onto the field we acted like we knew we were doing and we're pretty much left alone we march out in front of the stamps that we were in across the field from the brass\nThe other old grabs we're looking at us and we did are a few moves then we

chase which rich feasible hundred and five miles an hour is led to the loss of control the car driver exit his vehicle and slender scene on foot Sunni came upon a home he grabbed a beer bottle here and found on the ground and forced his way into the home were upon a threatened to do harm or less the residents dirt over the keys to their car\nA woman in the home retrieve the keys from another room when she returned she gave them to the man and she had a surprise a handgun she handled the guns who are male friend who ended up the intruder and told her to stop\nThe perp refused to sound advice and his dad went into the garage the start of the car later he drove it towards the resident who shot him to death through the windshield thanks colonel\nThis story is an unusual scenario and very interesting first let's talk about the woman's response\nI think she was near flawless she kept her had cooperated with a criminal and went to get the keys but she also had the presence of mind to get her gun as well\nBut then she gave it to the man of the house probably because she either didn't know how to shoot it professionally or because she wasn't willing to use deadly force on another human whichever case it was she did the right thing and handing off the firearm however\nI Would urge her to get some handgun training and to begin the process of developing a warrior mindset so the next time this happens chicken cut out the middleman and shoot the bad guy herself\nShe handed off the gun but apparently the male resident wasn't comfortable with using deadly force as well\nHe allowed the fugitive to get into the car into begin driving away I suspect he got in the way of the escaping vehicle and was almost run over there by prompting him to shoot through the windshield\nI'm not saying this was wrong but here's my question wouldn't it have been better to shoot him inside the home before he was in the car and driving away and here's why I say that\nNumber one shooting and intruder inside the home invokes castle doctrine laws which give you more legal protection than outside the home and your driveway or in the street to it is much easier to shoot a man holding a broken beer bottle out in the open than it is to shoot a man inside a moving vehicle\nThree the armed resident put himself in unnecessary danger by stepping in front of a three thousand pound bullet on wheels he could have been killed quite easily\nAnd for shooting inside the home would have caused damage to dry wall or maybe a lamp but shooting through the windshield on your cars going to cause a lot more damage now he has to replace a windshield and repair other damage to the interior\nBut I think the most important lesson here is decided ahead of time when you use deadly force in Wayne you won't inside my home and threatening my family with a broken a beer bottle that's a no brainer to me I think the proper military term to use here would be fire for a fact\n[noise] Thanksgiving\nThe movie the months is by by now please go to the front lines of freedom Web site go to the blog and get the link you can watch it for free or viewed at the end of the month I Would really appreciate

the front lines of freedom just miss [noise]\nRight right I I said I said you know when Franklin Roosevelt disgraceful a turn back Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany\nThey weren't out waving Nazi flags and singing\nGerman nationalist songs and talking about how they're going to transform angle at us in the U.S in Germany the image I mean that the people are mixing up the Jewish refugees and Germany with the German American button you know these people are not refugees ... they're not being persecuted by the government's they're\nThey're just living in kind of crappy countries\nYou know and those countries are crappy for a reason uh for historical and cultural and political reasons because they never embraced ordered liberty they um they ... they inherited a bad\nDictatorial political culture from Spain uh whereas we inherited a kind of anti tyrannical de centralized political structure from England\nAnd as a result they have worse government said worse economies they don't have secure property rights that's one of the major things there's a great Latin American economists her ... her and I think his name is ... ... or ... ... I think it's ...\nSoto was found out\nThis photo and have that if you enforce property rights for the poor and let them protect their property rights from the government and from thugs and from ... drug lords Latin America could be prosperous within a generation but in the absence of it\nThey were fleeing to America and we have a huge welfare magnet a lot of these people even if they ... they come in and start working their kids will grow up probably on public assistance large percentage of their family members are going to be on food stamps or right away refugees get a get a honey pot full of benefits from the government\nSo why don't you think is going to happen when they reach the American border\nWell my hope is that we will have the U.S military lined up and choking off the entire border and I think President Trump should to ... he's already said this is a national emergency he should start using defense funds to start constructing the wall\nYou ought to lay the he ought to lay the cornerstone of the wall gold plated with the big tea on it\nAnd start building the wall let Congress scream and yell blood\nJudges scream and yell he should for court orders and continue to use as authorities commander in chief to seal the border and you and take money away from gardening Afghanistan's border if necessary to guard at the United states border that's what we elected in four we didn't like Jeb\nBush we didn't elect Nikki Haley we elected Donald Trump because we wanted to put America First ah if we're going to be global policemen you know charity begins at home\nAnd as a crucial point I think because people feel a sense of mall moral ambivalence\nOh these people they just want to improve their lives okay first of all that is true of half the world if you are going to say that you if you pick up on doors and say this sucks I'm outta here\nI'm going in the U.S up if that is enough to get you went to the U. S. gets what most of the Islamic world would like to come to\nVirtually everyone in China would like to come I bet Bangladesh Pakistan you could empty the world in the United states and our welfare system will be bankrupt within you know thirty six hours but hey at least we feel good about ourselves as we know starved to death and watch the civil war overwhelm our country and turn it into it\nWhat I call a caucus and like so many other parts of the world\nBut what about the moral argument\nI think we should see our country as a larger extension of our private homes\nIf ... if somebody bags on your joints says he's homeless and demands to live in your living room you have the right just shut the door and use whatever forces required to stop someone from staying in your house and eating your food against your will the exact same thing occurs applies to us as a country is our country a common home\nThat we work on and we improve and we leave to our children were grateful our grandparents we lead to our children we judiciously accept newcomers or something to offer or\nAre we just on a giant refugee camp like the ones we see you know in Turkey and Jordan where anybody who shows up you have to take him and then you put them on the same girl and give them the same uniform and they and they gather around the same trash you know\nTrash cans with the fire is that the future of America\nFor too many politically this is gonna happen presumably right before the incredibly important congressional elections right and I I I I worry\nThe other bias of the media that we will just have video after video and photo after photo of some American either military person or ice person or border guard are pushing some mom with the baby and\nThen uh it's it's it seems to me they win the propaganda war\nNo no I think that I think you know how they win the propaganda war if these people set foot on us soil and that suddenly each one of them has all these legal rights and gets in at a George Soros funded attorney\nWill know that that's not to forgive me John that's not the propaganda war that's winning the war I agree but the propaganda war you know I may I say right to say one of those ... let me let me just breaking point\nIt seems to me that they win if they get in and they win if they don't get it and\nI don't because if they oh good I Hope you're right I I there's no cable talks I pray you're right\nI think if Trump shows weakness\nIf he caves then Republicans across the country we just our hearts saying we realize the game is over even Donald Trump can't stop this openly absurd obviously false attempt to claim asylum and refugee status\nIf even Donald Trump can't say no to something that is ludicrous and politically cooked up\nThen we're we're toast and I think that would depress turnout\nOnline I I agree with you I agree with you I just I agree with you I Do I think\nIf she I dance term it'd\nBe nice if you have to learn that that will mean in picture in pictorial form that they will be fights between Americans and civilians from Latin America\nAnd I think that will help us\nBecause I think people see that this is an invasion they can see it the people who are going to cry\nBecause a couple of people show up at the border and a soldier pushes them back\nThose people are already voting for the Democrats but I don't think it's going to be enough to get people to turn out for for its war otherwise going to turn out this is a national impeachment referendum but ... says all ready fanatical there they've got their their ... ready they're ready to go to the polls they've got their\nDead people registered to vote but left is all ready\nAt its maximum frenzy and hysteria they've maxed out\nWhat the Kavanaugh hearings did was wake up the Republican base a wake up the patriotic Americans to say wait a minute [laughter] they're just they're threatening our system of government that destroying an orange adjusted oh and now they're bringing in case the doors to transform country demographically by the thousands\nAnd thousands and thousands now\nNewtown already dot com for the rest of that interview and sign up for the podcast you'll get the best the talk radio every day\nMid week a cluster of bomb scares were reported at the offices in the homes of a number of Democrats among them George Soros Hillary Clinton and president Barack Obama you discuss the threat with Texas senator\nTed Cruz as you'll hear in the interview he was flirting with layer in China to switch off planes why I'm here today but enough about that enjoy the sex\nWithout Sen Cruz talk to me a little bit about these nine a suspicious packages at least one of them was a real bomb out of the president's condemned with the vice presidents condemned Rod Rosenstein condemned I'm sure you're going to condemn it\nBut the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy it's either some not in the basement where it's a hostile power messing with our election\nBut what do you make can be attempt to blame Trump\nI Love it if the media dealing with media does which which it any any narrative that they can twist against Trump they will do so and this is terrible I mean this is terrorism and whoever the terrorists\nDo I need to be ... you need to be prosecuted needs to be put in jail for a long long time\nAnd uh and and I thought that it that'll happen you know it's interesting you remember ... months ago uh we we had the bomber in ... that ... throughout Austin and and I met with uh the ... of the FBI of we're leading that effort or something and\nAt the federal law enforcement had for ... resources to put a bear it to track him down in terms of the components of the bomb I go there I'm sure they're analyzing all of those now would catch has got to put it behind bars but but it is wrong pilots is always role\nOr wherever it occurs on the political spectrum light you know we saw tragically a year ago a phrase gunman Tony to Washington DC\nOr if the objective of shooting Republican Congress and and and ultimately go into the congressional baseball practice and and and cheating in nearly killing a elites and and as it should not be part of our political discourse disagreement is fine even healthy to disagree on policy issues\nAh but but violence has no place in it
