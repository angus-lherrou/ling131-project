your garbage here move it over to your driveway\nBut here's how more ironic these people are okay let's not I want you to think about just put this in real life what uh what are some of the things California has given us\n[laughter]\nLots of stuff right yeah lots of stuff they've exported a lot of stuff to the country\nThat is a could easily be argued is helping to destroy our culture at the least of which is some of what they what they pass off as entertainment but I digress let's stay along these lines you ever heard of the black guerrilla family how about the Mexican mafia or the strenuous stuff the stuff out of the Mexican mafia\nThose are two of the biggest most notorious\nRight and there are others will go there in a minute [noise] the Aryan Brotherhood is another one\n\nPrison gangs that have infiltrated the nation's prisons they come from California but those aren't really the ones I'm Talking about you ever heard of Eighteenth street gang\nHow about ... thirty eight street gang how 'bout Armenian Power how 'bout the Aryan Brotherhood of Asian boys oh the avenues or the black dragged into the black sea soldier the bloods it's great to foresee is gang or the forwards and Borgia Fresno Bulldogs how about the hell's angels\nYeah California based right drug allows Logan heights gay men is of destruction models MC the Mongols that's another motorcycle club their games MS Thirteen Nazi low riders ... west or Familia\nPirates public enemy number one rancho San Pedro Santa Monica Thirteen\nSantas Estes tiny rational gang tutor villa ... was about the United bamboo gang the vibe goes that that's another motorcycle club\n\nMurray and the way voice Dr how about that is Thirteen how about watching about whites that how about all the subset of the credits\nAnd just the LA gangs\nUse the apparently Ms Hill believes if she wants to export the very gun control that arms those games because businesses to believe that those gangs aren't armed hills in idiot of course she doesn't believe that she's not worried about them\nIn all the famous LA street gangs that have been filled traded the rest of America Citi thanks a lot for that by the way of life\nFor they originated\nNow I can promise you in the clubhouse of every single one of those California based street gangs that I've just mentioned they're worried right now they're all going to go to the polls all those gang bangers you're going to the balls\nOf them because they cannot believe that Katie Hill\nIs going to put more gun control that she's going to make their life so much more miserable just can't believe it or we think about it either of them I\nPicture the meeting at the Eighteenth street gangs I don't know what do you call 'em gang houses I don't know I don't hang around street gangs ever have\n\nTo this picture of the meeting can you picture what's being said oh yeah oh man we have to go to the old man we're gonna make sure she doesn't get elected and we've got she gets elected or in trouble\nUm and\nThen somebody else pops up and says no wait a minute of and hold on a second we wonder well after she talking about us man\nShe's talking about all of our victims oh yeah that's right well wait a minute now they've all seen the light right who did a street gang support [laughter]\n\nIt's just I Know it's an ad that that's my whole point it's absolutely ludicrous but that's okay that's what that's what Democrat Katie Hill\nOnce for you but that's OK by doing all these things she's adequately protecting or retaining a right to bear arms\nOkay do you feel you know unfortunately for you in today's day and age there are headlines like this comedian George Lopez confronts Trump supporter at Hooters comedian George Lopez confronts Trump supporter at Hooters\n\nThere are headlines like this middle class Avengers attacking Republican candidates in Minnesota\nOr democratic operative arrested for battery against GOP campaign manager and it gets worse there or antifa groups that are sending threatening letters to all Republican so and we're not going away\nWe're going to beat you down\nMeanwhile Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer and the rest of those clouds are silent\nSo what does that mean that means they can do that kind of activity oh let me get really controversial um yeah that's exactly what it means\nThat's right I said it\nNancy Pelosi will condone any activity she feels might put her back in power and if she has put back in power with Katie Hill on the hill and more Katie fills like her on the hill\nWere in trouble\nBecause they will write new laws like Katie Hill has in California and they'll never stop they'll just keep going\nIt'll go on and on and on and on and on\nAnd as I have told you for years you as a good decent hardworking law abiding Americans are going to have to make a very difficult decision very difficult to ...\nAnd was there and my lovely wife losing and was there and some of our interns\nWere there

she has a book out called mad politics a doctor gene eleven welcome back thank\nYou and your yes you you sound a lot better before you sounded like you were in the wind tunnel and I thought to myself oh I'm\nSorry about that I had you had thought I don't trust the cell phone fell do it for you I ended up next year had I always like I don't know about that radiation and all but\nI really are you know I think yeah\nI I actually read a lot about it and they're pretty convinced that you know John that John McCain and others are Joe Biden I maybe I'm a little bit south on to their ear\nOh my gosh you're freaking me out okay uh well I uh I that's why I hardly ever talking but that's not why hardly ever talking to them but I hardly ever talk on my cell phone I'm not some people kind of live on the cell phone or like I Can't do that\nBut I'm just as we're talking about this president I and I was saying that he you know I'm agreeing with you in the sense that there's a level of sanity\n... that he displays in other words you you may disagree with him and all kinds of stuff but there is a kind of fundamental soundness to uh to the way he approaches things which you would call sanity and basically um\nI think it frightens the political left\nTo death I think they're very scared by it I think when Kanye West or you know who really was was a agreeing with that and saying that there's something here his leadership was a I think it really scares people because they're used to having these kind of you know\nPolitically correct robots that are that are focus grouping everything in polling everything and they don't they don't know how to think\nAh for themselves Trump really doesn't he's not afraid to because he's done it so successfully for so many decades that you really nothing can stop if [laughter]\nAt least the last minute\nYeah and I think I I think that you know you're at that ... or analysis so that you know a cartel or the flop or whatever you want to call it at a sea change very well uh in its own apparatus to all eight decades um public ... mockery I mean literally you know get it\nTo the controlled everything in your face and get their millions every election whether they win or lose so they don't really care as long as they get rehired next election\nWell but you know they had a bunch of no go ahead sorry\n... and you have a bunch of coach and who you know all each other to keep their uh you know\nA leak blew a functioning of the way it is their cushy relationship with the media there or Detroit cocktail party and all the rest of it the president came along and he didn't care about it\nAnd he's willing to wake up at ... he's going to drain the swamp and he was willing to\nGet financial aid apparatus that they spent decades building and there's a lot of money at stake here here's your kicked a cabin on it just the cabinet and of course I could give you a hundred other apples this president has one major accomplishment every thirty six hour at you know and that's with no help by the way from any Republican\nShow business most people I think we need and talk radio right they do get television shows like I Do every day uh knickknack any um I think most people\nWho are out in the public and put themselves out there and believed their ideas or we're hearing how your you know is that right I think that there are selfish maniac they're going to go kill somebody but I'm saying if you run for public office\nEspecially that eight level or higher certainly for president at the United states I think you would have a difficult case proving that you weren't and not just that some\nSome\nLevel right that's right and I and I put myself in that category as well like I didn't make you change and it doesn't make you equal and it doesn't make you idiot now are all evil people are probably\nThere is a great place on a section of very very different kind of nuts it's a lego maniacal kind of not just isn't that a dangerous right and I believe you have kept other mental efficiency as well but people get really can news about\nPsychology being a science and it's really not Eric it's really an eerie there's nothing you know it's not a scientific is global warming and I don't think that if I hadn't either and so you're right people have to be ... so I think one of them were really important things to do\nHere when they need to make a lot of people we go any further in that as\nThey started with the Trump Russia thing to try to destroy him because they don't like his ideas they went to the women thing they tried to destroy and with that now starting in paying its legal fees who knew that could happen you know there's going to continue that I Believe their final\nEffort is going to be to try to declare the president mentally incompetent insane or or perhaps with some sort of the generic ... mental condition that we have to be ready to fight back\nFor our values and things that we've accomplished with the ministry Loni that's working for for decades\nWell you're you're right and I also think that well we haven't mentioned speaking as a creative I think creativity or in madness\nAnd I use madness in quotes but there's a relationship there in other words if you're thinking out of the box and you think differently than others do people always want to call you crazy or you know burn her she's a witch because she thinks differently and I think that\nThis president without any question is wildly creative his brain is churning in ways that a lot of people and again doesn't mean you have to agree with him but you have to give him credit that he's thinking outside the box and he's stream we created he'll do things that you know you you would\nYou could go to take classes on how to be president for a hundred years and they will never tell you to do what he's done with\nKim Jong own or others he really is doing some things where\nI can imagine people say like oh I don't know that seems pretty weird to me but the point is that\nHe has a ... about it and he has been successful over the decades and so I think we have to give him the benefit of the doubt but I think you're right that that when people have nothing else this is where they're going to go\nWell and that's the whole reason why it will not politics because\nThere is a good kind of crazy [laughter] you know crazy like a Fox as it turned out ... ... and very well there's also the kind of passionate kind of madness you know right where he was mad skills I think president does how mad\nSkills and then there is that kind of crazy that we all hope to avoid in our life to the best of our ability by the grace of God I don't think that Jeanette third category and that's why I Will not politics and title that is such\nWell it's fascinating to me because I as somebody who um you know has observed is president I often describe him as a maniac and when I say that I'm complimenting him I looser uh obviously I just wrote a book\nAbout Martin Luther a year ago Luther was a maniac people couldn't believe the things that came out of his mouth he was also a flat out\nGenius I mean it's so so for us to be really\nYou know simplistic about it and say well there's kind of you know you've got people that that uh they don't want to make with ... and they're very very simple and they're saying in anybody's creative or they're crazy well you know it's as you say\nIt's subjective and and I think that uh you know most Americans won't buy it and most Americans understand that even if they disagree with somebody like this that certainly doesn't mean he's crazy we've just got about thirty seconds left Dr Gina tell us what else we need to know about your book meant

dramatic moment to ... to not only write a book on the subject but to write a book that take such a dramatic stand on this issue\nYou know air both of us are in positions where we're talking constantly to parents around the country and we were hearing sort of a lament with parents saying my my child who is now in college or as young adults\nNo longer it goes to church or they become so progressive in their their ... and they're they're leaving behind the values and the belief that we were trying to train them up and and so we've both been hearing this and and we start digging in because there's been a lot of focus on\nThe radicalization and that's occurring on college campuses yeah telling our kids left for it but what we found out\nWas that the data shows this occurred in elementary school and then in high school that that we're losing our kids\nSo that there are a lot by the time they're moving on to college so parents need to look at\nWhat's happening the impact on our kids' faith\nThe growing confusion over gender and sexuality or the lack of understanding of American history much less commitment to kill American ideals so that was that was part of the um just the personal impetus to these conversations we're hearing from people\nJust think that in spite of our best effort this is what's happening well\nI I guess I Want to say that you know we we all sort of know that this is true those of us who who take our faith seriously whether we're ah Orthodox Jews Christians are who are evangelicals are Catholics the point is if you take your faith very seriously and you have a biblical sexual ethic a\nAnd on and on we know that in this day and age the culture has gone mad they they don't even they don't even postulate that we are wrong they have declared it and moved on and they are sprinting in\nIn an opposite direction so that's the culture but to say that this has come into the schools to the extent that\nIt has and you're saying that and I believe that that's actually dramatic\nHow is it that public schools have gone from being you know the one room schoolhouse what were they had a picture of George Washington and they taught about virtue how did we go from that version of the public schools to the current version of the public schools what happened what ... what are the things that happened\n[noise] well I'm Erica my dad this process even though it was like for many people who went through the public or\nUm they have the warm ... I'm at home that were not an odd but there have heard that in the work on a farm or John ... who is here with the ...\nUm he did very very warm so pragmatic learning that did that was intended to children from the influence of their parents and embarked on independent investigation where there is no object at\nAll I Know now so let me let me a hit pause here to say that there are a lot of people listening or who aren't really familiar with John do we I don't know much about do we accept to know that he's guilty\nEach of what you just said that he's one of the seminal bad guys in this story and so when did he lives and and why were his ideas adopt and now we've all heard of the Dewey decimal system in the libraries are so he's made that minor or\nIn a dying contribution but the point is that he was a large figure in ... when did you live and when with these ideas accepted\nSure absolutely he I'm doing was a a he was a professor of education even though a lot for my background is a lot of the right so I'm always interested in me and tell us off or go here and\nWe're talking this is Theresa Theresa yeah daily lived around the I'm In the Nineteen very active in the Nineteen\nTwenties up to the Nineteen forties um and he was a philosopher but he also taught in education and if you look at the um philosophy of education that permeates our public school he aired as really the father\nOf modern education and so he had this very outsized impact on our children\nUm how they learn what the school how looks like we're hearing structure and the patriots air to facilitate rather than teach everything is emphasize on experience\nUm and and if you notice education ... cycle through bad all of that being said the big concern here is that because of his employer and as a pragmatic philosopher I'm because of the pragmatism that permeates the public schools\nThey have become public education has become aggressively secular\nOkay now so when you say pragmatism we all have some sense of what it means to be pragmatic to be practical but you're talking about pragmatism as a philosophy\nHas a philosophy which which really and is that there is no objective truth into way really engage in moral reasoning and\nOne of the one of the subjects we catch on in the book in chapter on social and emotional learning our kids are encouraged\nTo make moral decision through a consequential with Lynn meaning the criteria for whether or not they do something for whether or not something that's considered wrong or right there there are two criteria number one opinion of their peers\nFor their social group and number two the consequences and throughout at all because of the aggressive secularism\nAll public education teachers are not supposed to bring in the concept of objective truth until right there right away in public education you have\nA moral information that is going to diverge sharply from any kind of Judeo Christian or any kind of take the moral formation\nI mean it's just staggering thing when you say they're not supposed to bring an objective truth\nA it's an insanity one plus one equals to a really him is different from lead there's objective truth in some of the disciplines we're going to be right back folks this is a very important conversations ... show we're talking to marry right passing injuries of foreign and about whether you should pull your kids from the public schools immediately stick around\nHim nine twenty\nMy business is at stake because the government told me I Can't live on my faith in the workplace\nI was

have an hour let me go to the trade Mrs satanic uh when I hear that bureaucrats who do not love our children are\nAre presuming to step in to push the parents uh who are in many cases half killed themselves to feed these kids in the cold these kids to take care of these kids to change the diapers to love them\nWhen those people are being pushed out because some bureaucrat has been given the authority or to to do that we are\nAt a dramatic impasse and so I Want to underscore the title of your book is get out now\nI mean I think the problem for a lot of people is how do I get out the public school is free uh where do I go I mean I think this is why so many people have pushed for school vouchers and those kinds of things\nThat Eric yeah one of that one of the things that were sort of running into that when we say though we we do get that response from parents\nUm what do we do and and I just wanted to read something back um I just I just want to emphasize that they can you know problem if you're a pastor and you're listening to this broadcast\nLook around in your church kids in your congregation\nAre being aggressively of angel eyes and the secularists and so it's no wonder we see the number that millennial to practice their faith dropping and the numbers with the next generation the ice age and generation the it it even lower\nAnd so that the responsibility while I as a parent to have a responsibility for my own children\nOf us who are listening who don't have children or who are in positions to help Marshall and resources and try to come come together and think of creative\nSolutions it's also it's on every one if you are involved in a church you need to look around and try to find a way to educate your young people\nWell I mean you can amateur this is the whole thing is that I Know so many people in these people to me that they are heroes\nThey are home schooling their kids it blows my mind that they can do this but then you find people that are homes when your kids and they don't seem to be as amazing\nAnything how're you doing it and then they tell you well um we have different ways to do it there are other families are in the neighborhood or in the town who do this and we so the idea that\nYou yourself have to home school your kids there's a whole network or with all kinds of resources so that's that's a very real option I think a lot of people aren't aware of that\nRight and that that's one thing I mean I Would emphasize that you're home schooling today is radically different from what it was before because of the Internet because of the availability of of collapsed because it's it's just much easier to accomplish it and it's no longer kind of the ... thing that it was maybe Thirty years ago or something [laughter]\nSo it's I Know parents who are working full time who are home schooling but they do that collaboratively with others but I guess the real point I Want to make your Eric is that there is a cost to education right no matter what you do now might be a financial cost if you choose a private school it might be time cost if you're home schooling\nBut they're the cost to the public education system when we're looking at these results\nResults are so dramatic we're going to go to a break your if there are so dramatic I I Want to come back to this because we've got to count twenty two\nYear\nWith the\nSarin News I'm
