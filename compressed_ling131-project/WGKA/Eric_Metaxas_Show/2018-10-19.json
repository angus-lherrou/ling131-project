I I it's very difficult for me to watch that stuff there are certain programs that I that I have to watch certain news channels that I have to watch\nAnd it's getting difficult more difficult by the day to listen to people who I have respect for go back and forth and literally pretend to be the news when it's just opinion very very dangerous that's my thought for the day remember what you're seeing is the vast majority of what you're watching\nOn twenty four hour cable news channels is not news but it is opinion and I don't care what channel you're watching\nThe same goes for Fox is it does MS DNC its opinion it's just a matter of whose opinion and what opinion and what agenda driven opinion it is either way remember its opinion that's my that's my thought for the day for you\nGun owners I've gotta I'm running out of time here with you and I noticed promotion is going to run out quickly so make sure\nTo take the time the text arm A. R. M. U. D.\n'cause their number eight seven to two two armed to the number eight seven to two to up to twenty four chances to win the gun a day is come tonia people I I get emails from those of you some some of you who have won the ... not all gonna wish I heard from all of it like to know that a lot of you are listening to the program or armed American radio fan\nThe promotion is available and other venues but it's\nIt's it's a it's a it look we're just saying it's not a Powerball shot here okay it's not one and two hundred Ninety seven million\nJust however many people participate so make sure to get in on this you know I like I was reminded you before I Won that cold Coors Light by doing the same thing in the ... at the sun trust park at a Braves game this past season so these things you're winnable\nBut here's the one thing you can't win the Powerball you don't spend two bucks on the ticket right I can tell you that for sure I can tell you the odds are pretty crappy but I can tell you the odds are definitely crap here if you don't buy a ticket\nSo touched arm A. R. M. E. D. to eight seven to two two and you might be that winter good luck to you okay the promotion and soon don't know exactly when I Will keep you posted I'll let you know when it does go back to the Old West\nYou know I spent some time in tombstone I Wish I had more time to spend out there doing some fun stuff but we were working while we were out there we had a lot to do that with a lot of find people about some upcoming events that were helping put together\nFor the freedom day's in June of next year and that's going to be on your faster than you can shake I can promise you\nBut it's fun 'cause I get these emails all the time I talk about going to sell a lot of broadcasting from their three or four times over the years and I got this one in from David ... who says mark I couldn't help but laugh when I heard you talk about gun rights in tombstone on Sunday show\nIt seems incredibly ironic to me that the whole reason the herbs and cowboys got into that famous gunfight was because the Marshall was going to enforce the ordinance to disarm the cowboys\nThey were violating the city ordinance by carrying guns in town\nSome today might even question who was on the right side of that argument that's from David David you're right and then David right back we're gonna we're gonna discuss this year but he writes back on October sixteenth that original email came in to me from David on the sixteenth at seven thirty three am\nBut later in the day he writes back from his rise in four G. L. E. E. smartphone mark I guess I should have listened to Monday show before I say even my email you did address the issue of gun control with the mayor keep up the good work I Love your show David well David thanks for both email let's talk a little bit about that\nBecause it fits kind of well together doesn't it when we're talking about Montana and a little city ordinance tombstone edits peak at about Fifteen thousand plus residents when it was booming\nThere were people who predicted that tombstone could get bigger than San Francisco well that never happened\nToday's resident countless between sixteen hundred and twenty six hundred depending on who you talk to the numbers not hard I we were talking with Gordon Anderson and tubes and he said it was about sixteen I hadn't thought it was about twenty to twenty six he lives there I'll trust him on that because he knows what he's doing is working with the chamber of commerce\nBut in its day even at Fifteen thousand still is still a small town well booming small town\nWho put together the city ordinance of no firearms allowed in town who who who did that in the earth's do with the ... do it to the town council do it\nI don't have an answer to that I'm going to find out for you\nBut I Will tell you this that it was the urge to enforce it and I wouldn't be surprised back in those boom town days to see the sheriff or the either the county sheriff or in this case the town marshal\nActually create the ordinance out of thin air why under the misguided principle that it would keep the town safe was tombstone safe I guess it was\nIf you were a law abiding miner who minding his own business but if you went out after dark you and the risk of being robbed or shot remember how dark it was back then with no electricity and those streets\nGas lamps candles don't hold a candle to build all fat bright street like do that\nThe point that I'm trying to make is that everywhere the herbs tried to enforce gun control including dodge and tombstone is what we're talking about now it was a complete and utter failure\n\nAnd what David is referring to is the fact that the cowboys were in town rumored to be armed in violation of that tombstone city ordinance\n\nWell you know a little bit about the gun fight you know that that was more than likely an excuse for the herbs to go down there\nAnd take out their eggs on a group of individuals who had been threatening to kill them I won't go into the history of that right now it's too deep we don't have enough time what I Will tell you was that gun control which used as the excuse to do it\n\nTo ... brothers and Clinton were killed in the span of about thirty four seconds\n\nAccording to the herbs because it wouldn't hand over their gun\nAgain more proof positive that gun control is an utter failure it will fail in Missoula, Montana just as it failed in tombstone and dodge and everywhere else it has been tried\nEvery where it's been tried don't believe me see Chicago Baltimore your numbers are climbing through the roof\nMaryland has some of the strictest gun control in the nation that we even want to talk about Newark in Camden in Trenton no we do\nAnd what do they do they want more and more and more what are they doing in Missoula, Montana coming after more and more and more\nThe petri dish is just beginning to fester and grow in Missoula, Montana and the rest of it\nThe state and better be on alert no wait the rest of the nation had better be on alert\nThis is how it spreads\nOne day Montanans who weren't paying attention will wake up on their five thousand acre ranch and go\nI Can't do what on my property I Can't sell what to my neighbor rancher I got to go into town\nAnd pay thirty five bucks because of some dopey skinny gene wearing latte sipping soy guy who said what because he's from San Fran and knows what's best for me I don't think so cowboy\nYou better start paying attention\nOr this is going to happen to you and it's not just Missoula, Montana\nIs to check on Amazon there's a rank and you get on a product descriptions it says it gives you the book ranked no ... and uh obviously you want to get the number one the number one bestseller in all of the universe\nIs now here's here's the thing right now what's the number one book my book\nWas oh I don't know a thousand or something like that and then as I got on Hugh Hewitt and whatever to it it went to like three hundred something which is decent right but it's still not in the top one hundred\nWell this morning are just now it jumped to one Seventy so we're we're breathing down the neck of the top one hundred right yeah so what's the number one book in the country Steven cold there has written a bitter anti Trump\nFake children's book now it's a real thick children's book in the sense that you would never give it to a kid it looks like a kids' book but it's not appropriate for children because it's just kind of mean and weird\nBut my book of course is uh even though it's a huge book for adults like coal bears book it's really also a children's book genuinely you can give it a kids and people are giving a kitten kids like it\nAnd they specially like to say George Soros but what drives me crazy is that called there is on every night right being mean it's one thing not to like the president but he's pretty vicious if I had a TV show like his\nI Would never be that vicious about Hillary Obama or whatever it's one thing to correct jokes I mean Johnny Carson always cracked jokes about the president but there's a meanness to it that bothers me\nAnd so of course now he's ... he and his writers and put out this book and it's literally number one\nIn the country and so I kind of like to send a message\nA ... to the to the country into ... into Mr cold beer or by having my book uh at some point over take his book yeah so that means his book will have to drop from number one and a or my book and just go to number one but you know there's so many people in this country who don't hate the president and I kind of think like hey\nI'm if you don't make the president or maybe this book is for you and I actually think that this was a good book to give to people who don't like the president because it's it's warm hearted it's not I mean it's not like ha ha but whatever I just just had to say that I was so\nGlad that Hugh Hewitt loved it and Dennis Prager loved it [noise] um I was supposed to be I'm Shannon Bream last night and I think I said that on the radio but they had to cancel so I'm going to be unseen and bring tomorrow night which is friday Thursday that's tomorrow night [noise] um\nSo I just wanted to say that their own also album mhm um we are we remember you know I was well I've showed it to you we have these he's my caveman\nA buttons light so it's like a ... campaign button that says he's my caveman which is to the at the end of the book\nUh they said if you want to be king and he goes no he says you know I I I have a free people you're ... you're free your free people and and a free people held their leaders what to do in the leaders have to do and they say you mean like a president he goes yeah and it goes if that's what you're looking for um your caveman so we have these buttons printed up to say he's my caveman\nAnd it's the Donald figure with the sums up\nAnd we can't sell them but we can give them away and if you buy five copies of the book and send us proof of purchase two info\nAt Eric ma taxes dot com info at air attacks is dot com\nWe will send you five buttons for the five

mailing packages and stuff but they're big buttons they're not little buttons they're like nice big oh yeah we've got to be out an awful three and a half inches across but they're they're like big cookies and um\nAnyway so they say he's my caveman and we'll send you for free if you send a spoof purchase for buying five were more books at info and Eric my taxes dot com I Believe that the deal my

do a throwback Thursday 'cause we a lot of times we have these gets on there so great we think we really should play that twice well\nEvery Thursday in our two we're going to play an encore and this is our friend odds Guinness a he has a new book out called last call for liberty\nWho are going to have him on um I guess in November will have him on again but we did an hour with him this summer and it was just tremendous so uh I guess I'm a\n... we we just feel like we want we want to play it again if you didn't hear it and even if you did hear it he's just sitting on these guys were if it yeah yeah so um I just wanted to say that that's an hour to today a bright okay oh oh\nAlliance defending freedom yes\nUm we've been raising money for lines defending freedom now a lot of you know that they're a nonprofit organization they rely on the generosity of others right they provide free legal services for clients being targeted by hostile governments or states like jak Philips was targeted by the Colorado civil rights commission who no one elected\nAnd they basically said we're going to put you out of business because you wouldn't bake a cake to celebrate a same sex wedding and he thought well excuse me I I don't bake Halloween cakes I'm a Christian if you come here and he asked me create something for you or if it violates my religious principles I Can't do it well we're going to have him on tomorrow to to discuss this in detail on this program\nBut I I Want to say that alliance defending freedom stepped up to help him it would've cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for him to defend himself and his business he was basically going out of business I mean they're going to put you in a business because wedding cakes are\nHis a bread and butter to mix metaphors so so he really was suffering alliance defending freedom came in and took it all the way the Supreme Court and one seven to two so people think that this is some narrow conservative ruling no seven to two\nAnd so life depending freedom did that for free and this is going on all around the country you heard about the deal with um\nWith uh the former fire chief of Atlanta\nUh Kelvin Cochran who's been on the program so that's what they do a there's another case right now that's going on and all of these things they do folks for\nFree which is why we have to help right so a more recently Washington state\nOr their attorney general decided to target a grandmother name barrel ... Stutzman she's the owner of a local flower shop because she declined to create a custom floral arrangements for same sex wedding\nShe felt that that violated her religious beliefs ATF stepped in to offer her legal support for free okay so this could be you or your neighbor your friend or your cousin or your brother\nOr the actual cost of doing the litigation like that were huge okay they did it for free if it could happen to ... could happen to you so are there now is standing strong and not wavering here's a clip from barren out\nWithout freedom to that my kids are twenty three grandchildren and the future there's not a price on things that we can't find my freedom is it it's a little warmer tomorrow it's because we kept\nTalking about ... into doing something that is

about a fight\nThis is a fight and again you don't have to agree with everything about Donald Trump but you've got to understand that if you do not vote for him and for his candidates and if we do not hold Congress we're going to have horrific Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer chaos\nIn the nation's capital for two years it's going to be very unpleasant a and I'm I'm concerned for the country so\nPeople really need to vote I mean wherever you are folks please uh it's it's it's just something that I I think it's never been is important you know I've just got this previous like\nYeah I ... everything

the leaders of the Democrats the house and Senate thing we intend to sabotage the president and see if we take the house it will be\nA subpoena all through subpoena investigation altered bucks to go for walks and look for any and that is good for Americans but just because they hate Donald Trump ... the question on the ballot will be are you giving in to hatred\nDo you love this country it's really about the more complicated than that\nWell the irony of course that the that the other side keeps talking about hate down with hate I've never seen so much hate in my life it really is dismaying it's genuinely dismaying that people are who they have all kinds of issues with this president will be good for you if you do let's have the debate\nBut to effectively a say we don't we're not interested in having a debate we're interested in shutting you down with every kind of epithet it's it's all a mental place for us to be in the United states of America it's it they run out of arguments Sebastian\nAnd I don't know if we do when the ... midterms which by God's Grace I Hope we do you kind of wonder what happens to the bitter left at that point\nYeah I mean this is one of the

Daniel I'm and there's a chapter called\nWhat do you need to know about war tell us a little bit about that but as you know a lot about war and and and tell us your background in case people don't know you beyond just seeing your face or on Fox News that your pundit but you have an amazing background a it with regard to a military fighting\n\nWhile I was blessed them up at your two or three of my life I call it on a warm day\nAre found myself at a military base a on a selection cool boss ended up a member of the British Army reserves in the military charging unit\nFell in love with that kind of life babbled in it in college when I started studying law systematically looking at the evolution of terrorism did a PHD in that and then was all of it off the nine eleven to be invited by a U.S marine\nAlleging gold colonel lick crap\nAnd become a member of truth faculty teaching ... going to cause a lot of us base in Europe\nI'm going to marry an American undecided but we need to come to the last\nGreat the British hoping that this nation was again blessed with a job teaching at the national defense university ... ... did you lost his degree in a Catholic terrorism and and then one day in June of trying to fifty and I got a phone call from Corey eleven both\nOf you may be interested in it by saying candidate Trump all national security issue so that's that that in a nutshell but ...\nWell it's ... it's why you're qualified to write a book with the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies you you know a lot about this knowing this chapter ... ah what do you need to know about more tell us a little bit about that because most of us don't have anything approaching your background\nSo it was the first things first um when you say the word war to America does it mean something\nQuite different from if you say to a European law somebody for ... when you say all for American listening I think the ... image to the prior to ... the\n... infantry tank battalions dog fights over the Pacific but if you look at the great if you look at the last two centuries elaborate trout in the book more than eighty percent of all conflict since the polio is what we technically term irregular warfare all I'm conventional meaning\nIt's look the armies of various countries fighting each other\nIt is the army of one nation sprayed fight against non state actor whether it's Stephen Decatur youngest us naval captain ever\nYou believe the end justifies the means and that's how you get fascism communism about how you get even the caliphate\nWell it it's so beautiful to I remember the first time a I had you on this program we talked about something along these lines and I thought uh this is someone with whom I can discuss the deeper things because really that\nWhat you just said is indeed at the heart of it all if we understand\nWho we are what does it mean to be human it means to be made in the image of almighty God but fall in broken and without the messiah\nOf the scriptures we can never be redeemed so that the idea that we can be redeemed or or resurrected without the cross of Jesus Christ most Christians would sort of claim to understand this but I think that we have to connect it as you've just done\nTo a global ideology there have been ideologies such as the one in which we live in the west here American style self government we have always recognized that mankind has the capability\nTo be evil to do bad things so if you raise human beings up and think that they can be perfected we can be perfected and if only will do this or have this technology we can ... perfect our whole society that has led\nTo the Soviet gulag you just set it and it's led led to the to the Holocaust and in our own age would lead to a unchecked by people willing to fight or as you and I I'm\nA hope to do it will lead to a different kind of Holocaust in gulag and there's just no way around it when you think human beings\nCan protect ourselves without God it's really chilling I mean is this stuff of you know an entire novel\nIf you are a good deal self the role of ...\n... ... ... there is no limit to ... you will justify been and you'll role as well ... ... you can become the next ... if you think that it is up to you\nTo create perfect then you become pope bought a new will look into a third of your population\nAnd you will kill anybody for example I mean this is John Boehner is that person was a perfect the goals is a deck last say ... states and he will be killed because that's what happens when you're ... at the end up with those other risks that you are as a civilization\n... it's an amazing thing and that's why I say it's wonderful to speak with you because I Want to educate my audience those people who don't yet know this have to understand that and when we talk about\nA conservative view politically\nOr we're not just talking about some issues we are talking about the deeper principles of who we are who do we think we are\nI mean listen there are strains within conservatism\nA within a libertarianism that miss everything you've just said they don't get it they think that technology is the way forward and that that we don't even need to think about\nThese kinds of things they think that the free market is a kind of God that can be worshiped into the free market will deliver everything and and we always have to understand that that the free market or in a free democracy all of these things have to be checked\nBy morality by virtue we the people have to make these things work unchecked or we you know we can

human being\nRegardless of any of the description you might give them of class race size speed intelligence and so on this magnificent and terribly important today 'cause you know we talked about is the post truth generation sadly we're becoming the post human rights generation and is more important\nHuman rights are being undermined\nThe whole value of the individual is being undermined using a whole lot of modern views like multi cultural do some more utilitarian as some of the greatest go to the greatest number they have no place for the individual\nBut my concern tonight is really looking towards singularity\nAnd post humanism there was no high view human does to stand against some of the things that are coming so if you go back to see us Lewis who's the evolution of men he talks about the final stage of ... generation who think they will make people in their own image\nBut we're we're very close to that was a gene editing\nAnd so we better have a strong high view of human dignity if we're just stand against some of the effects of dehumanization which are on the way\nIt's interesting because uh you said that rabbi sacks a\nOf England uh\nCame up with this phrase the magna Carter of humanity to refer to to the versus in genesis that say we are created in the image of God I guess my question to you because I I talk about these things of course a lot as you would guess but I Want to ask you where\nUm ... if somebody does not take the Bible or\nAs you know the founding documents of their their thinking from we're would someone get the idea that there is such a thing as human rights you can't I mean how did you think\nFor the universal declaration of human rights Nineteen forty eight it was partly paused enrolled motion to announce his some and the death camp revelations and so on\nBut fortunately it was led by Charles Malik who was a strong Christian and it came out of a broad Christian consensus you wouldn't pass it today 'cause the simple fact is if you take the alternative views around today say a\nAtheism cannot go round the precious most of individual human rights simply conned read books like John Gray stroll with dogs and he's quite open if God is did\nThe idea that we think we're different from the animals as much as what Peter Singer coal species is um you know is the greatest mistake humans have ever made we're only animals from the sun

contemporary thinking on these issues I'm really not\nI'm not you know well read on what philosophers and others are writing about this these days but we all well a lot of people know about Peter Singer and but but I guess my question is there's so many people who don't have a biblical view do any of them see\nThat without the biblical view without this idea this the magnet card of humanity that were made in God's image with ... does any buddy today who doesn't have a biblical view the\nWhere not having that new\nLeads to is there anybody expressing a some reservation about where this is
