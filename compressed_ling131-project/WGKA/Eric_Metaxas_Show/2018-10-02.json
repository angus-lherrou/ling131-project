I'm a civil war buff\n[noise] excuse me have been for many many many years in particular the battle of Gettysburg\nWent to see it when I was a kid it fascinated me later in life when I got out of college my first job as a sales representative or a motor carrier took me to York, Pennsylvania and part of my sales territory you know the area I sales territory covered from the Maryland border which was around truth Barry going up straight up interstate eighty three\nOf the Harrisburg then I'll kind of over the Carlyle ... down to Gettysburg and then back down to ... I had that big triangle and of course that included Gettysburg, Pennsylvania so I found myself going out to Gettysburg a lot a lot of manufacturing there's a lot of industry in Pennsylvania particularly central Pennsylvania and Gettysburg\nHas a lot of manufacturing both on the way through you know out to hand over in down that way from York into hand over an out towards Gettysburg\nAlong route thirty and also a lot of stuff out there but I had a guy\nHis name escapes me now I Believe his first name was way but he he was\nHe well he was an old guy then and he was in his seventies that that that's going back thirty plus years ago he's no longer with us\nBut it was a traffic manager and on the weekends he was a private tour guide\nAnd historian at Gettysburg and I used to go out there on the weekends and take his private tours and I learned more about that battle and and and just saw things that that battlefield off the beaten path that you don't normally get\nWhen you go out there and toward the battlefield on your own lots of very cool stories if you're interested let me know marketing armed American radio dot org and we met up more than happy to tell you some of\nOne thing that always sticks with me about Gettysburg 'cause I remember being on top of little round top having the description of the battle being told to me from a perspective that you don't get from the paperwork that you get\nWhile you're there and the little maps and you could look down and see the devils than you could look over in sea seminary rich and you could see way back out where Pickett's Charge it occurred you were standing on this high ground\nAnd I was hearing the stories of officers that were being shot by snipers from both union and Confederate side\nAnd you know part of the reasons the civil war casualties were so high was because the ... pretty far out age the technology of the weaponry far outpaced the battle tactics of the time\nWhile warfare was changing the battle tactics were not changing as fast as the technology of the weapons one of those weapons is the Henry repeating rifle\nThere was a twenty thousand dollar reward offered for stolen civil war rifle right now that police in central Pennsylvania have offered\nAnd they're just there's just for information about a stolen Eighteen sixty Henry repeating arms rifle if you know anything about the Henry repeating arms rifle\nIt was the ... it was the rifle that you could load on Sunday and shoot all week it was a devastating weapon during the civil war I mean imagine if you were shooting a a a black powdered must get and you have somebody that had sixteen around\nIn a Henry repeating rifle this thing was devastating on the battlefield than it helped change the outcome of the war\nBut it was apparently along with to revolve hers\nStolen from the national civil war museum in February after somebody smashed the glass display case with a sledgehammer how does that even happened the Henry rifle was on loan\nFrom a from a private collector according to guns dot com and it says here and I quote originally belonged to Abraham Lincoln's first secretary of war Simon camera and embarrassing engraving with his name the police estimated value between four hundred thousand and a half a million dollars\nHow does that happen is there nobody standing around how does somebody get in there and smash this thing open with a sledgehammer\nAnd get out with that rifle and for that matter what do you do with it it's like stolen artwork I've never I guess people themes to steal that stuff just put it in their houses and admire it because you can't do anything else\nWith it less you'll be busted for stealing it and I guess they'll sit on these you know like art thieves do they'll sit on these paintings for decades and decades and decades until they finally reached surface\nBut four hundred and five hundred thousand bucks I guess according to this investigators believe the suspect recognized of vulnerability in the way out of the museum prompting the heist\nWhat kind of person recognizes that I mean you've got to have the evening mind even recognize this stuff and you know again just another reminder that there are bad people out there\nI guess the display was sponsored by a twenty five thousand dollar grant from the from the n._r._a.\nSaid normally the guns remain locked away on the second floor behind additional doors and other layers of security but apparently these sat on the first floor of the museum narrow window\nAnd apparently there was there's complaints about the museums outdated surveillance cameras are quoting many of which lacked any recording capabilities with the whole good as the camera is not recording anything\nBut nonetheless when I saw this piece I thought wow I really hope they get this back the Henry repeating was\nHenry repeating firearm was um it didn't change the outcome of a war by itself of course but it played a a major was a pivotal role was a pivotal rifle was originally ... the original Henry rifle dating back to do this age was a sixteen shot we work however room fire a lover action\nA patented by Benjamin Tyler Henry and eight teams sixty after doing a whole bunch of work on this thing and coming up with\nWith his design but it was interesting because it was also the same rifle that found its way into the hands of the suit in Cheyenne and was used to help wipe out Custer out there at the little big warn\nOf these guns in in America is just absolutely awesome\nHenry repeating arms I've had to Henry golden boy twenty two is a wonderful gun the action on the Henry repeating arms today's guns are just absolutely beautiful most of 'em today are chamber it in the forty four forty or forty five long cold it W. are set a forty five long call\nThat he absolutely loves I haven't had a chance to shoot it but I'll be with him on the fourteenth of October this month out in the beautiful Sonoran Desert so maybe we can get those guns\nOut there in the out there in the desert\nBut dumb interesting stuff it was you know for a civil war soldier anyway\nThis thing was peace of mind [laughter]\nI'm pretty sure it was peace of mind they called it the sixteen or Seventeen shooter depending on whether or not one was voted in the chamber or not\nBut a a big it made it made a big difference in soldiers confidence level to know that they had this repeating arm in their hand or was it I Want you to imagine the amount of firepower you would have if you were to get your hands on one of the\nThings versus a black powder single shot or whatever it was you were you were shooting at the time that might have been standard issue so you know this was this was the real deal you can buy these Henry's today\nThe twenty twos or a just a tremendous amount of fun to shoot a tremendous amount of fun as you are so who said that that you could load the gun on a Sunday\nAnd shoot it all week long I'm gonna go out my memory here I Believe that was Confederate Colonel John mosey\nHe was a let's just say he became infamous not famous or infamous\nFor advancing on union positions in rating them throughout the war but it was he who said that they call it that damn Yankee rifle that could be loaded on Sunday and fired all week long\nI Am here Eric great to talk\nTo you know it's so good to have you on I Wish I could talk to you about something more fun but you know what if we're talking about something it's important that ... even more important than just having fun so let's get into it there is so much going on in our country we need wisdom what are we to make of the current situation what do you what do you have to say\nWell apart from being a gas and appalled and horrified Eric I Can't say that I'm particularly surprised on if you take a step back from the immediacy of the Kavanaugh debacle uh\nAt the hands of the Democrats if you try to look at this from a thirty thousand foot vantage point\nIt all makes complete sense because the Democrats look that the left has been at war with the constitution the country free market economics individual liberty\nFrom essentially vary from the beginning of the republic but certainly over the last century or so the progressive movement has shot to in the words that President Obama fundamentally transform the nation and one of the bond that meant by that it's within the left means by that more broadly but she has\nChanged the United states away from the foundational principles that made a great individual liberty I economic freedoms John national security rule of law move the country away from those pillars and toured a collective status state socialist economic\nA command and control from Washington and so on [noise]\nThey have been on a war to us that did that change for decades now\nThey have they have met with resistance by the American people who are essentially a center right people throughout this entire war that they've been waging so because they haven't been able to achieve a lot of those goals by the ballot box\nBecause the American people see it for what it is and rejected they have used the courts\nParticularly the Supreme Court but the court said all level to impose their ideas and their agenda\nBecause they couldn't do it legislatively [noise]\nSo when you take a step back and you look at the confirmation fights over Clarence Thomas for example\nRobert Bork were they were successful and torpedo and got candidate for the nomination right and now with Kavanaugh who will replace the swing vote Anthony Kennedy it makes complete sense that the left would take this approach\nTo destroy the man\nHis career his reputation his good name his family because for them that it's not personal for them it's all about power and control and if you dare to step in their way of achieving that power and control a few threatened to block\nTheir forward march in any way Eric you must be destroyed so none of this should come as a surprise I mean I think all decent people of goodwill are outraged at what about what is happening to this good man but when you take a step back and look at it and the broader sweep of history it makes perfect sense\nWell uh I I agree and I guess what I'm Wondering is right now in America [noise] when people you know that I think the thing that that that um [noise]\nIt's not just the left it's the it's the enemies of all that is good and true and beautiful they exploit\nOr the innocence where the kindness or the graciousness of the other side Hitler did it\nUh in spades I mean people were to buttoned up to understand they're dealing with a madman until it was too late or you see sometimes\nI'm the you know the Bush a forty one and to some extent Bush forty three there there's somehow gentlemanly and they allow themselves to be role and played by the other side often and it seems to me right now\nYou have something like that going on in other words the viciousness on the other side people aren't really\nThey're not prepared to accept the absolute willingness on the other side to do anything to win including put someone forward\nWho has so far\nPlausible to say another was ... this woman I'm Ford\nIssue you know anybody can say anything but they're willing to put somebody forward like that\nEven without corroborating evidence just because\nThey think it's going to work they think that if they do this they rattle the cage long enough eventually somebody will given isn't that what what what the Senator Flake just did in other words if you screaming loud enough in the elevator he doesn't have\nThe guts to say excuse me I'm trying to take an elevator if you don't mind you know he wouldn't say that so he left this woman rented him in the next thing you know we have another week of of lunacy it's because the other side has has taken off the gloves but I guess my point is\nI think your average American eventually does see this and I think that your average American at this point is seeing the craziness that that this has gone so far and it really does become a kind of madness that's taking a silver\nYeah and I look I think you have to take into consideration too is that the the allegations the person making the allegations whether there's cooperation substantiate should we haven't gotten any of that\nFrom the accuser frankly any other accuser of judge Kavanaugh\nAnd also to your point about the American people and what they see somebody came forward and said\nI Know that judge Kavanaugh I drove a car also a bridge or it off and say a Massachusetts island and round a girl\nAnd here's the body and here's what we know and here's how he left the scene and passed down for ten hours before he chose to report the accident and hear the police reports and so on people would say holy cow\nHoly cow he is being accused of murdering someone there are police records medical records proof witnesses eyewitness accounts and so on and this is a heinous crime it's murder\nBut what they're saying is they're they're trying to ... because this woman story is not holding up and it's full of holes and inconsistencies no going back to his high school yearbook\nAnd and trees in that and whether or not he had an extra beer or two in high school or college most Americans take a look at that and say you know what if an extra beer or two in high school and college is his biggest crime or I could never make it to the Supreme Court I\nMean people are the people know that life is full of shades of gray and we none of us are perfect the last perfect person to walk the earth was Jesus Christ\nNone of us are perfect and people are saying we only you're going to try to block this guy for something he may or may not have done in high school when he was Seventeen or sixteen years old it is madness and I think that when you're looking at\nA lot of the polling and and it's very fluid now Eric but what I see is now both sides are are now jazzed\nGoing into the turns because of this onslaught against Kavanaugh\nBut what's more interesting to me is that\nIt seems that the Republicans now the Republican base conservatives even independents we're watching the spectacle and it's grotesque hit job on this very good and accomplish mad they are now completely jazz to come out and\nVote that's my that's my hang\nModicum forgive me we're going to go to a break we're going to come back from talking to Monica crowd twenty two year where\n[noise]\nIn a day where Hollywood celebrities left wing

that you're you're right thinking politically or\nThat you love Jesus but um you worked for Richard Nixon and knew Richard Nixon toward the end of his life I just strikes me as an extraordinary privilege that you had [noise]\nIt to do that and so therefore I guess I Want to ask you what do you think a President Nixon would make of where we are now but if things were very divided in this country when he was the president but it seems to me that now it's simply worse\nYes and I'm Glad you asked me that question Eric because later in the week I'm going to have another call enforce spectator usa the British I excuse me the American edition of the British spectator on Nixon's thoughts on the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill\nA spectacle because I was working with him at that time and I think it's important to revisit Nixon's insights into what went down during that period of time because it is so whereas an end to the Kavanaugh experience what we're going through today but I Would take to answer your broader point\nOn yet at the moment that we are currently in I\nI'm not so sure that we have seen this since the Vietnam Era and then before that the civil war period in this country history I think it's really unhealthy\nI think it's very dangerous and I think the difference this time around which makes it even more so than the previous two periods I mean obviously the civil war to the very existence of the country but it's at stake you at the huge moral issues of slavery and abolition and so on\nThe period of the Vietnam Era also was carrying the country apart over the war and and the counter culture and so on so these are all kinds of great of a people but I think what makes\nThis particular moment\nPerhaps the most dangerous is that the other side again at war with the constitution at war with free market economics individual liberty all the great American pillars of exceptionalism yet they are so willing to buck the constitution and it's very\nUh foundations of what makes this country what it is\nIncluding basic rule of law principles like due process I mean the left has always been so\nOutspoken and so adamant about transparency accountability due process you've got the ACLU\nWill now over the last like two days or so the ACLU has come out\nSaying Kavanaugh's should not uh get to the Supreme Court\nWell what about evidence ... injury rules and requirements what about due process what about the presumption of innocence until proven guilty all of the things that the left\nThe ACLU and said that they've stood for forever the idea that they would be so willing to dispense with all of that in order to achieve their bigger goal of transforming the nation\nOh we forge there's bipartisan compromise to allow the FBI to look at this for a week do you think the last few think Coons do you think Feinstein and and the far left\nThat they look at this as oh this was so great a bipartisan compromise this is just yet another to lay tired that they want to push this\nPast November in the vote to see if they all have more leverage to stop this seat from ever being filled until the twenty twenty election right\nI mean that that's obvious and that's the question is do people on the ... is there anybody there\nWho gets it I Wonder ah what the president's role has been if he's had a role behind the scenes or if he feels that he has to be very very careful but I I the president has always gotten this stuff he's somebody who is you know kind of a warrior at heart sometimes to a fault but I really do think that Americans\nWho are inclined toward traditional values toward a um toward voting a\nMore conservatively I think a lot of them the reason they voted for Trump and the reason they're probably upset with the Senate now is because of this I think\nWhat is wrong with these people are playing Patty cake with the devil Dianne Feinstein his so cynical her legacy will be how she cynically played this this is at the end of her career is so ugly so negatively political it's depressing\nYou know over the weekend Eric I was watching MSNBC a little bit CNN a little bit the bill Maher show on HBO little bit and I literally had to turn it off because I felt literal Natasha because these people are so cruel\nAnd they're still vicious and they're so ruthless and the pathological liars\nLeah wrong with that because we know we know that we're not the judge\n... the ease with which they will mock and disregard and tear apart a good and decent man like Brett Kavanaugh over politics over their war for the future of the country the viciousness and cruelty that I saw I literally had to turn it off and get away from that\nBecause I felt it on his spiritual level and you live talked about this we've talked about our our beliefs and and our faith then Jesus and everything I look at these battles not just on that the sort of natural level and the political level and so on obviously it is\nBut I also see a spiritual level to this is a spiritual warfare this is good versus evil\nAnd it's so clear to I think you and me and and maybe not to some others\nBut the weapons that are used are so outrageous and inhumane that I think most of the American people even if they don't see sort of a spiritual dimension to this I think they feel it and see it on some\nLevel you listen you you could not be more right at\nHeart this is a spiritual battle and at heart all real battles or spiritual battles but this is clear that the the lines are becoming clearer uh the the evil\nOr when people can mock a good man like this and treat him as though he is guilty and you start realizing something's wrong with those people because\nEven if you thought he might be guilty you still believe in fairness you still believe we've got to go according to procedure it's clear that people they don't care they just want to win and it's it's very very ugly and I I think that um\nThat I didn't think I Would uh you know go go there but I wanted to mention that the Kanye West thing I don't know if you saw clips of him on Saturday Night live but I thought\nI never thought I Would consider him a hero in a brave man\nFor him being willing to uh to speak out against this bullying as he put it that's exactly I mean if if the if the Senate or\nA Judiciary Committee and had half the ducks the he had they wouldn't be putting up with this nonsense I just have to say I maybe when we come back we can talk about that because I just I don't know did you see it\nWho who would've thought Kanye West would emerge as a hero of the Republican\n[laughter] I mean can you imagine I mean it's ... I've been\nReading about this all day yesterday and saying you know let's let's back up Kanye West and let him know he's not Standing Alone that we've got is back he wanted to put the mega hat on on there and all and they were bowling in backstage\nAnd corn not to do of course they were but they are they are scared to death if somebody like Kanye West comes out for Trump they're just going to

west and you know why he's punk louder because she is standing up\n[laughter] you'd be impressed that I knew about this well you know what you know about everything so I'm never impressed I'm just like the rest of the Greek neighborhood oh I Know you're you're ... impressed I'm impressed than a\nGlobal way with you on such a level that nothing you can really improve that so there you go okay now listen we are unfortunately um have to talk about what's going on uh\nWith the Kavanaugh hearings it's a grievous crime in the United states of America and you've written a couple of pieces at the stream\nI like to go to stream dot org stream dot org and check out what you have written one of them is called the forest of the Kavanaugh hearings and then the other one is this is how one would frame Brett Kavanaugh framing the negative sense\nSo I'm Okay John what do you have to say\nWell what we're seeing it just shows what we saw was the the equivalent of a show trial\nWhere um the people in charge of the show trial trying to destroy someone's good name destroy him politically and destroy us politically\nOr they just kept rewriting the rules and moving the goalposts and to mix metaphors throwing ... one piece of spaghetti at the wall after another\nTo see if it sticks and then if it doesn't stick it doesn't matter because there's more spaghetti and the thought oh Michael ... found some you know a disturbed woman who's been you know who's been subject to penalties for harassment and defamation of character\nAll right well that's not true I got something else or yet what do you think about this it's like a traveling salesman comes to your door and he's pulling these weird gadgets out of a bill that bag you know oh you don't you don't want a watermelon sharpen your\nOkay that's absolutely fine I got something here that you could make toothpaste outta him you don't want that okay let me try something out [laughter]\nIt's like Mr ... from green acres [laughter] yes and Mr Douglas I have a genuine raccoon coat I've always wanted to do my Mr any impression on the air he sounds a little bit like Brent Scowcroft but we can't we can't get into that and he knows you know that was doing that on purpose he looks and sounds like Brent Scowcroft\nI never get to do my Brent Scowcroft impression\nHe's running for the [laughter] You're welcome will so anyway the the thing is ... let me just say this\nUm [noise] we are unfortunately\nAt war we yeah we were playing Patty cake we're playing nice and I really think that if Kavanaugh had been able to be voted on before the flake flake out\nUh I think\nWe could have proceeded and the the the bitter left would have continued to snap and growls but we could have moved on with some semblance of border with this having happen now with this call for the FBI investigation I think the gloves are now off on both sides I think\nYou know they tell you what it's about it's not it's not just about Kavanaugh it's not just about the Supreme Court it's not even just about roe versus Wade which was on but no how low to ditch his about destroying Trump's presidents I was on the phone this morning with some very serious people who who used to work in the ministry and\nAnd this is about stopping ... Kavanaugh preventing Trump from from getting a nominee on the court getting the base the Republican base so dispirited so defeated so humiliated that we don't just lose the house of representatives\nAnd Trump gets impeach which is like an indictment the Democrats now think they can win the Senate and remove him from office that is how lived up\nThis pack of sharks are because they taste blood in the water\nSo relieved that slip this is about this is all about taking down President Trump it's I mean each Brett Kavanaugh is a nice guy was friends with the Bush family is the kind of establishment Republican I Would probably normally avoid like the plague\nBut I'm sure they are very good jurors\nNone of that matters nothing about his character matters now people are saying he's guilty of perjury we can't prove that he molested Dr Ford with can't prove we ever met her it doesn't matter doesn't matter the inconsistencies in her story which she told under oath none of that matters what matters is maybe\nWe can catch him in in an exaggeration or a slight\nInadvertent misstatement of facts considering his college drinking habits\nNow I just want to be clear people are saying it committed perjury because he denied that he drank too much he ... he said quite specifically\nI never drank so much that I blacked out or had time or I didn't remember what I had done that is all he said under oath or anything else you hear people talking about\nI wouldn't call it spin I Would call it a why I Would call it leibel and character assassination and anyone who said otherwise you'll he lied about drinking no he didn't eat your lying perjury what is your character problem\nIt's you know it's an amazing thing because even imagine I mean even just step back and imagine what we're talking about we're talking about a kid in high school and the first year of college I remember you when you were Eighteen when\nWe were kids in those days right you're on a pretty sight your kid but I mean it's hilarious because I remember you\nAt age Eighteen I remember myself at that first of all it's forty billion years ago let's let's be clear okay this is not something that happened in Nineteen Ninety nine a this is ages in ages ago\nAnd the drinking age was Eighteen at the\nTime was was Eighteen and I drank to excess every single weekend because that's what you did on those campuses and\nYeah and I have I Would have five gin and tonics before dinner\nAnd mess or foreign them for it [laughter]\nAnd then I go out to a bar [laughter] that'd be fine well\nBut the ... listen I can just say this for a fact right in my life I look back on\nNow what I Want my daughter or my nieces and nephews to drink that much or anything like that absolutely not I had a born again experience in my mid twenties and I'm a I'm a different man I can say that and I and I never drink\nExcess but in those days drinking to excess never got to the point\nWhere you're blacking out or you can't remember it never and I think to myself if somebody drink to that level you would say you got a problem like you can't drink that much that\nThey would not graduate near the top of their class at Yale and and get into Yale Law school people like that I knew people like that yeah they tended to drop out than dry off and come dry out and come back by gold silver silver in in in every sense\nWell I mean that's the that's the point is if you've got that kind of a drinking problem where you're actually literally blacking out you're not going to be able to function at ... I mean if you can function of places like yelling won't be at a high level\nAnd so we have to I mean the fact that we have to have this silly conversation but just to so people understand\nUh we're talking about something that happened a million years ago for for for starters then we're talking about the whole thing is sort of degrading but we have to have the conversation they were going to be right back folks I have the great joy of speaking to Johns ...

understand\nWhat is at stake right now America as we know it is at stake if you don't believe in law and order and you want to burn everything down\nThe Democrats are pushing forward that agenda there

throw in the kitchen sink at Kavanaugh enact Trump and I just want to say from the bottom of my heart\nI Am grieved for my country and if you weren't to grieve for the country when you see this kind of thing\nYou need to step back and and really try to educate yourself an civics and understand that if we don't have the rule of law in America if we don't have that\nAmerica goes away and that would

Stalin had show trials of his former colleagues who had helped\nDue to a pro bring about the Russian Revolution some of them get a lot more fourth and eighth ad on\nHe one of the things that was the

Stalin wants to do at the moment so big claws\nThey disagreed with him on say how to collect devised the farms\nThey were criminals trying to destroy society and they needed to be destroyed and they were going to be\nBadgered with new and more and other false charges until I confessed to something and then that can be shot in the back of the head are sent to a good luck can't well Brett Kavanaugh
