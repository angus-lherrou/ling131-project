then it's going to do it relationship but romantic and ... because you know my mom and I read on our cat also dating um she's in her fifties and widowed\nI'm living with my character and just starting her life over for the first time and killing on a dating app and then you have my younger sister again who's in her twenties you the millennial\nKind of leading by ... you know she got married to for thirty has a kid but now it's sort of feeling like that seven year itch in her marriage and getting a little bit bored and wondering if she made the right decision and letting vicariously to our character that we're having fun\nSo tell us about your character Olivia what kind of person who she\nShe ... in the beginning she works in insurance doing really well\nI'm without a relationship for the last few years she had a five year why not you know after she got out she just went over to our work and didn't date and had done really well and so now she's starting her doctor and getting on tinder after she go to the gynecologist ... played by ... where he tells her that\nAt thirty five basically you're starting to dry out and if they ever want to have kids or anything either you know like he kinda got to get started on at least dating um which is a lot of things I think the women here in the thirties and there are there are there on tender\nAnd um she decides to date I'll let her ... and you'll see her kind of start opening up there and becoming a different person away all of them have big ark\nWell she has two hundred and fifty two matches so yeah since Olivia do is kind of doing the ultimate in speed dating or are you assume that not every day there's a home run is now is the case [laughter]\nYes and also she's not always the home run you know what I mean like I feel like that's a big part of dating is\nIowa and he needed it you know that like drink too much or I was the one that was a very ... sometime it right and the first episode you'll see that she's the one that the man I'm and it's not a data that we show that they don't like you'll see a different date every week and then you know we're going to go on to interdict you ever had a really not that it's just a jumping off point of the show\nThe show is really a grounded it's about life more than it is about just tender dating and these relationships between the mom and sister\nUm that I think a lot of people will find relate a ball and a lot of it's based on my own experiences in life whether it be with dating or just embarrassing things like the gynecologist office that thing happened to me I'm so you'll see a lot of that stuff brought to life where it's kind of cringe worthy comedy sometimes [laughter] but I Love to watch\nSo when do you think that many matches with Olivia learned about human beings and what does she perhaps lose them so\nYeah I mean that's that that's really the message is is\nYou know she's not at the end of the day she not out looking for\nMr Right to save the day and come in and you know live happily ever after I'd like to get the message across that you know you're going to even experience all these things in life but really most important thing is she's figuring out who she is and what she loves that if somebody fits into that part you know naturally than great\nBut it's the three women kind of figuring out who they are at the later stages in life\nUm and and how important that is\nAnd how much it affect you if you bring somebody in and get married and make that everything to you what happens like right on and when her husband dies she's left with nothing you know she has no skills he's never had a job and she has to come of it with my character\nIn a in a big part of it is just you know as women I think we're we're taught as kids like the princess is live happily ever after and you find your prints and all that stuff and it's just it's so much more about know figure out who you are you know do your thing they got what makes you happy and if somebody fits into that great\nYou mentioned the delivery ... mom Mary she's dating\nCan't play by rather than our cat is amazing\nThe fact of the ... or something in common is that India do that in hints or relationships are they become closer his mother and daughter\nIn certain ways that died in certain ways that it it you know a makes it worse because of your mom is dating and she's living with her and her she's a little bit like a teenager you know what I mean she's like I said she'd never had a jobs are going to see her\nGet a job for first time like figure out what it's like to be independent and Olivia their roles were reversed for a living is more like the mom and she's like the kid so and how that affects Olivia when she really just\nNeeds a mom you know it it it it sort of based on like when my mom was single in her fifties they're very different my mom's very independent but the idea that um that that when you're when she's doing that and they kind of become your friend as opposed to your mom and how that affects the relationship I always found that really interesting and I bring\nThat into their relationship\nTo you mentioned rows and rows of course is your ... was it like working with her\nIt was really fun I mean she's a proud she's been doing this forever and she's so good\nAnd honestly was perfect for the role like as soon as her name was brought up everybody we were just trying to think who would who would be good for this role you know somebody in their fifties that embodied all of these characteristics are good values play them and she was she was dead on and when we met her\nShe just was game to do anything so that was awesome and and had her own ideas I wanted to bring menopause into this world you know what I mean like what it's like to be going through menopause and maybe that's not really funny and interesting and sad\nI'm so she was great I mean the fact that he was gay to do everything it's a very vulnerable role that I think a lot of actresses would have trouble playing that she took on end did have challenges but but handled them really well and I think now that in the end\nRight now you mentioned that size why is partially autobiographical so humbled to believe you truly you\n[noise] you know it's it's it's based on parts\nOf me you know but it's not it's not like it's definitely not an autobiography it's not I'm not just like\nPlaying myself exactly there's a lot of things about her that maybe are things that I went through before that she's still having to go through or they're loosely based on even like other people that I Know that I'll bring into the character but I always at the core of it almost every character I write has a piece of me and them\nUm so so there's that but it's definitely not an autobiography um I don't I you know I'm not\nAs uptight as her and closed minded as she is you know but there are there are big pieces of of me that are in there for sure\nSo personally when it comes online dating your view what are some of the positives and we'll just some of the news\n[noise] [noise] well I think it's you know there's a lot there's a lot of choice and I think it makes it for people\nWill you know like if it makes it hard people to settle down like they do like somebody then there'll be like but what else is out there because there is something else out there you know there's a little you can go home and and go to bed and get your phone out and start swiping on more people and have two more days the next day if you want\nSo I think that that can be a little bit of a negative it ... it it it makes it where people it's hard to connect I mean not that that in the show it's easy to match hard to can act I think that's a big problem but positives are I went on there\nAnd had all those two hundred and fifty two matches in real life and I met my boyfriend who I've been with for over two years so I think you know if you can just kind of sift through and when you find somebody that's worth it and great stop and take it in and connect it can be really amazing 'cause I wouldn't have met him otherwise\nRight and you know we think the way that you know the forefront of a mountain and say well I think today [laughter] because people buy off on that side that\nI think you know you have to pay people at that time to understand why they thought you know they don't want they did what they did but like I said everybody had eight everybody had a family everybody was worried about you know standing in line\nAt the same made you can send me away as humans\nAnd Andrew working people find out more about secrets on line\n[noise] well Smithsonian Channel have a website you can always go to our website I should tell 'em oh just one more time than the previous area just wild can be another theory adopt but fat\nI'm bringing shade aren't that great fun and I think at that rally king mystery\nThat we help solve\nVendor it's been a tremendous
