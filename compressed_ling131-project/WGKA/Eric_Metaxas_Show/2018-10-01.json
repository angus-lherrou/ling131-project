{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "And um we've been happy with the reversal of some of those policy not all of them but some of those policies and are chaplains have had a little easier go as of late but the pressure is still on\nBut are chaplains they're happy to serve in these challenging rapid situations\nAre guys want to be there to minister to and help young people\nAnd that's overwhelmingly who they serve in the military young people who are trying to sort out their lives in an honorable fashion and it's a pleasure to be able to be there and I'm so motivated whenever I'm Around are chaplains we've got about a hundred and sixty of them across the bears services active in reserve duty\nI'm so encourage when I'm Around them because they want to be there to serve their country\nAnd they know they're doing so much good for these young people\nYes sir I was raised in a church going home and fell away at high school and early on in the army I wanted to come back I started going to chapel I knew something was missing\nAnd while I was in my first combat tour I went to a chaplain and sort of express myself and then he didn't know what I was talking about he wasn't a Lutheran I can assure you that [laughter] but we have to have the chaplains out there who can help people I ultimately to help\nFind the spiritual truth\nAnd and and get involved and having chaplains that are there ready to do that\nAnd free to do it is incredibly important I currently teach American government at community college here in front of each of the constitution and I read the first part of the ... the first amendment Congress shall make no law regarding the establishment of religion or prohibitive for exercise are up and I asked my students so who's restricted\nOnly Congress has restricted\nSo having pastors everywhere but particularly our military has it's critically important we don't have time but I'm sure there are a lot of stories that you're chaplains have shared of how they have touched lies\nOh they've just been dozens and dozens of stories we have a rich tradition of service we currently have rear admiral Greg Todd uh serving as deputy chief of naval chaplains and chaplain of the marine corps\nMy dear friend retired chaplain John ... spent a career in the navy serving young people he tells me every time I with him all the wonderful stories about encountering young people and and being able to help them at very very challenging moments in their lives it makes a huge difference you know we in the Missouri Senate don't believe that\nWe are here to Christian eyes America the government operates on the basis of reason\nAnd law the constitution is based upon sound reason\nAnd reasonable people believe that one's religious beliefs and responsible religious actions based on that belief art to be free\nThat is not something that should be coerced and forced upon somebody by any government whatsoever\nAnd so we support government that keeps the public square free for us to speak and think and confess and act on the convictions of our religion and responsible ways and we will do that and we'll be glad to lay down our lives have been a family of military history my relatives served in\nThe revolutionary war the war of Eighteen twelve the civil war of course World War two and many other places lost relatives in World War two and in Vietnam so we will be glad to stand by Americans of other Christian denominations non Christians and others\nAre to stand up for the value of being able to protect our religious and conscience freedoms and to keep the government out of that business\nFaster I'd like to have you speak to my class because that's the essence of a constitutional republic which is what we are this is going to get on the front lines of freedom we're discussing the role of ... supporting our military community with Dr Harrison\nThe big message of Christianity and certainly the Lutheran Church is proclaiming that Jesus Christ is lord tell us about your churches approach to this critical message to our whole community not just the military\nOne has to live with one's conscience in life and when we act wrongly when we know something's wrong when we were at odds with our fellow men at odds with our family\nWhen we have done things that have caused injury and hurt our conscience bothers us\nAnd even if we think we are following all the things we should do if we take a second look Jesus turns up the heat and says look it's not only committing adultery it's anybody we've ever looks at a woman ... has in terribly\nWhen we see the law and it's full force we recognize who we are all of us sinners there's not a one of us that are different I I don't know any or sense but I Know virtually all of mine and what I don't know my wife can remind me up [laughter]\nBut I Know this Jesus Christ God's Son came to save centers and there's no one that does not fit Jesus is for all he loves you and your sins are paid for\nYour cherished he honors your vocations in life his father and mother he forgives you when you fall short any strengthens you to serve others so it's all about being forgiven of my sons rejoicing over that fact and knowing having his mind for free and I shall serve my fellow man where God his place me\nFaster that says it\nFrom one of the things that we find soldiers suffering from his moral injury they obeyed the what they were told to do with a shot into the house and they found out through women or children or or person that they shot that they were told us you've turned out to be an unarmed somebody or whatever\nMoral injury is a challenge and going to the lord sounds like the answer is that a fair summary\nIt really is a captain Johnson Shaw works on this that the army War College he's one of our chaplains and he's doing cutting edge work on this whole issue of moral injury in fact I talked to my father in law often and he he offered remembers being ordered by his sergeant to burn down the home of an elderly man who had a lot of Nazi paraphernalia in his home\nAs they were marching into Germany in World War two at us for ever bothered him\nBut look Christ for gives all of those things in our past\nThe Bible says in many different ways that our sins are like a drop of blood in the ocean\nAnd what's very important is for myself as a Christian and others who are in these circumstances to pray lord forgive me for those circumstances forgive those who have caused something that was not moral to be done\nForgive me even if it was the right thing and moral to do forgive me for my ... my challenges might difficulties over this and cause me to trust in your precious blood\nAnd I would say seek out a pastor seek out to pasture make that pastor speak the absolute from to Jesus Says who's whoever sends you forgive therefore given to them your services past\nAnd it's all forgiving and you know in Jesus all of our works though sinful or morally difficult or questionable\nJesus forgives it all makes it pure white unacceptable to God and God will use this is the beautiful thing just like you use the cross of Jesus and all that terrible suffering for good the Bible promises that God will use your suffering York terrible suffering for good\nAll things work together for good for those real cold according to his purpose that's the promise of St Paul and the Bible and it's true for you even in these terrible ambiguous difficulties\nPasser that certainly says it all one more time remind our listeners if they want to plug into the Lutheran Church was serious and how can they do that yeah just come to Elsie a mascot or G.

information that you won't get anywhere else on the front lines of freedom dismissed\nJohn Yorker piece by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer era thoughts on it and what it means I think\nIt is a shocking dereliction of elementary journalistic practice to publish this story at all um the New York times says and its story today\nThat it literally contacted dozens of people who were supposedly contemporaries of\nMisery mirror as and judge Kavanaugh none of whom could substantiate a single word that she said the New Yorker piece itself find a single person one single person\nTo say that she heard this story and he's pretty sure that it was Kavanaugh that is\nYou know I mean it's just beyond it beggars description first of all the New York times certainly and its people certainly\nWould like to take some credit for derailing the cabinet nomination and they found it impossible to publish this story so did the Washington Post the story was being retail to multiple journalistic outlet certainly only one that that went with it on the basis of a single person who's\nA claim was the New Yorker and it needs to be evaluated in that light that is to say this is the opposite of a credible allegation and credible allegation has supporting cooperating details cooperating witnesses\nSomething like that Ronan Farrow who's made was on the story demonstrated that when he published the Harvey Weinstein story which of course had\nI don't know eight named um victims and a very specific ... you know I'm supporting material and supporting evidence none of which one team has ever been able to um\nOther than we're jak dorm or prove was not true\nNow that it's a damning piece instead of Ronan Farrow can guarantee said he's got quite a lot of capital in his account but he's withdrawing it quickly now John pot or it's when you assess all that has happened and\nWhat do you think is the impact generally I didn't blow bubbles are in danger of only talking to each other and the country might see this differently than the blue bubbles to\nWell I mean I don't even know that there is a public but if you say that there is a mass public\nUh issue here this is a matter for activists on both sides\nI'm sure that eighty percent of people have no idea what's going on over the vaguely following lived their allegations against judge Kavanaugh the people who are most outraged by the fall for the sake of this allegation for ... the allegations against\nAh the the other allegations of blood before the allegations that um that what it will serve to do is to make sure that we're the Republicans Zorro or already going to vote will drag themselves over\nGlass to vote but that it's not that it will depress other people the people who are less likely to turn out and we'll go at this was all just a a as a gigantic mess and I don't know what the hell's going on and I'm not really I I'm just going to stay home\nAnd I talked to so and as you know and she said you know one of the things she's picking up is that women are involved here but women also have babies who are boys and a lot of people don't like\nThe change in the standard of accusation that is occurring in real time before this is so far beyond Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas or in the same room at the same time that was he said she said\nThis is a shift in how we do accusation and it's very disturbing to some people I look I Know people are applauding because they want to be Kavanaugh I get the politics but I think even they gotta worry about\nThe shift in the accusatory standard John ...\nWell they should and everybody should I mean basically what we have here is a literal replay of McCarthyism that is to say a Kavanaugh says acts his friend mark judge says acts of bad himself\nIn his memoirs about his personal misbehavior and because Kavanaugh\nWas a high school friend of mark judges we're now to judge Kavanaugh by judges behavior that is called guilt by association that was the crime that we were under the impression are a lot of us were under the impression that have been\nA you know have become so egregious during the McCarthy Era that people understood\nYou could not and you could not you couldn't ah\nConvict someone on the basis of the behavior or the ideas of a friend of his\nAnd yet here we are and people are doing exactly this and it's all\nA I mean I I Believe by the way in the ... everybody that I talked to who doesn't who ah that I've talked to who believes the allegations against Kavanaugh the blood before the allegations is is doing so in good faith like they have\nTheir own personal stories they have this they have that they're not just\nYou know people who just want to see him go down right so um and that's that's quite a number of people um so the problem that's the problem with guilt by association is it's a very very tempting like\nThis is how we this is you know sort of human nature to say well he hung around with that you know we hung around with the bad guys so he's a bad guy\n[noise] my mid week Democrats to everything at the wall hoping something would fit more accusers I had enough the following his mind breakdown of the Democrats ruthless effort to destroy the character of Brett Kavanaugh\nAs for what Chuck Schumer said about why don't we get the FBI why don't we get the FBI I play for you Joe Biden from Nineteen Ninety One\nOld good old Joe ... Joe Biden vice president for eight years everyone's favorite uncle Nineteen Ninety One he was committee chair of the Judiciary Committee when Clarence Thomas came under one of these attacks and here's what he said\nThis is about whether or not sexual harassment\nOccurred\nIn last week judge\nMe from the beginning in at his moment until the end\nThe presumption is we you\nKnow we're going to hear more witnesses are going to come in to cooperate your position in ours\nWe'll find out whether there's telling the truth or not as best as we are capable of doing just like he was a judge or when you look them in the eye and make a judgment\nJohn\nThis is less directly you\nThere's my pontificated colleagues Democrat and Republican alike to judge\nI have not made in my judgment based upon this proceeding because we have not heard of all the evidence\nAnd the last thing I'll point out the next person refers to an FBI reporters being worth anything obviously doesn't understand anything\nThat's vi explicitly does not in this or any other case reached a conclusion\nPeriod period\nSo judges no reason why you should know that the reason why we cannot rely on the FBI report you wouldn't like it if we\nDid because it is in ... clues they say he shed she sat in base in Syria and\nSo when people waving at me I report before you understand\nThey do not they do not they do not\nReached conclusions than\nThey do not make as my friend points out more addict\nThey do not make recommendations\nThey do not and that is why Chuck Schumer is such a lousy liar because the record is so long on this the understanding is so complex\nI don't want any bad to happen to the doctor ... and I wanted to be embarrassed and I wanted to be stressed but she'd been manipulated by the Democrats who do not care about her testimony do not care about her do not care about cabinet and his family they do not care about anything except to power\nAnd this out early discussing ambush is blowing up in their faces and you cannot vote for any Democrat anywhere in the country for any office\nWithout endorsing best not one Democrat anywhere can you support\nIf you if you are disgusted by this process because this is what they are all about you never saw that with Republicans with the Justice Kagan you didn't see it with Justice Sotomayor you never see it does it happen if you were\nDecent this isn't in decent process there isn't a\nTerribly horribly flawed in decent process and the Democrats on that committee who were involved in it who are set to it are are marked for life their scarred for life by what they're doing by this it will not be older will never get off for them for what they have done to everyone involved\nAnd if you live in California where I Am today don't for Kevin do we own your Republican vote for Kevin de Leon run against Feinstein percent another Democrat\nIsn't isn't that true of the ethics committee and\nI was just about to say that is true of the Senate Ethics committee but no other committee but you could extrapolate that to other committees and then there are a couple of other reforms that I proposed\nHow should that come in and he'd be asked chosen you could imagine a system where the Democrats pick the Republicans on the committee and the Democratic caucus and the Republican caucus picks\nThe Democrat so each side is trying to pick what they consider the most reasonable senators on the other side of the aisle\nYou could further imagine a committee where each her off he um had subpoena power um you didn't need to have an ... a majority which I'm a ... would mean that for example in cases where there's a\nGovernment when the Senate controlled by the same part of the presidency the opposition party at least still have some oversight ability to try to pry loose information to make sure that the American people are really seeing what they want\nTo say on radical suggestions but you know we're living in a world of radical polarization\nThat would would this committee that you're anticipating would that be for specifically looking as Supreme Court nominations or any judicial nominee I had\nProposed that for a presidential oversight cause a problem with presidential oversight is when there's divided government that's all the um the Congress does is just hearing after hearing after hearing and try to prevent the present from doing anything but when there's unified government uh when the presence party controls the Senate these\nCongressional watchdog become lapdog since I was trying to even things out a little bit I proposed for Senate oversight committee of the present but you can imagine that we do it for the judiciary and here's why you might imagine that we do that\nBecause we live in ... or so to speak a nuclear world not just with nuclear weaponry but the the nuclear option today for Supreme Court nominations it only takes fifty one votes not sixty as it used to in an earlier era\nNow what that may mean is\nUm [noise] that I'm at this may lead to sort of very nasty intense polarization um when the majority party jammed it down in the minority party throat um and when the president doesn't control the Senate maybe a everything is blocked that with the Garland situation\nHow do we encourage 'em senators to have a little bit more bipartisanship may be having a committee that by tradition as fifty fifty that might be one way of doing it it's a radical change am I\nAnd I hadn't and even in the post script they didn't propose it for the Judiciary Committee because the script was panned on July Fourth and before the Kavanaugh nomination\nMuch less than that the hearings which have really been disheartening to us or many of us\nListening to the entire interview with professor Omar on channel review dot com coming up\nI was terminated and by the grace of God alliance defending freedom was there and they didn't let me see this in a fire truck\nAnd I said I'm a

brought to you by the outlook on line huge savings on the items you need and want it's a big deal the outlet online dot\nWelcome back to a town hall review I hear the stories of the loss of religious liberty right here in the United states are growing in number\nWhether it's a football coach fired for praying or an engineer dismissed for his belief in traditional marriage if you are as blame though is what happened to tell them corporate [noise] after nearly five years of services the fire chief in Atlanta Georgia [noise]\nHe joined me on your show along with the attorney alliance defending freedom senior counsel David courses David would you bring us up to speed on what happened to the G the trial but it was last year and what's that\nWhat's a credible about those cases is is that we have a guy that the the pinnacle of his career who's been in the in the fire business if you will for over three decades\nUm as you said was appointed by President Obama instead of the cheapest fire administrator the top ... position in the entire country and because he was also a man of faith and he decided to write a of a men's Bible study on his own time so he does it outside of work he does is research\nAnd a couple of people at work at a copy of it apparently they take the book home they read this one hundred and sixty two page book\nThey find one or two offensive things in the book in the middle of it somewhere\nBasically say that marriage is meant to be a between a man and a woman in any sexual activity should be inside of that marriage\nThey get offended give it to one of the council members who is openly gay he complains\nAnd just because of that they actually ... they actually fire the cheap they terminated him from his position even though he brought the city to like the top rating they're saving the citizens and and the city millions of dollars because of what the cheapest done and just because he wrote that book that had a couple of lines about what the Bible has said\nWhat what tens and hundreds of millions of people believe uh he lost his career over that\nWhat was the lawsuit earlier this year David with the cheap laughs\nAnd over this year so we've been litigating for a couple of years with the city or we filed the lawsuit against the mayor cause he read in the city and the good news was after years of litigation the court ruled on our behalf they basically said that it was unconstitutional for the city to require\nPre approval to write this book so their argument was this was they use the moonlighting law believe it or not and said well you're doing this blue you know like he was working at some Burger King at nights and said that he had to get permission\nTo be able to write a religious book about his face for a minute Bible study on his own time he had to get permission first from the city and the court basically said that's unconstitutional you can't require people to get permission the only permission he needs is the first amendment\nThat cheap Cochran you been on before I told you this before I wouldn't expect you to remember but my grandfather was a fire chief ... and he used to say you don't get to be a cheap
