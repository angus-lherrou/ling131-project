I don't even allow them to eat in peace at a restaurant or go to their homes without being yelled out in Trenton\nIf that's what we've become\nA didn't truly that we've lost the country\nA ... and I hope that some smarter thought bull Democrats will ... will wise up and get control of their party\nWell we're going to go to break we've just got a couple of minutes left folks with Governor Mike Huckabee stick around we'll be right back\n\nAm twenty\n\nHello [noise]\nI don't see how my life can get any better [noise]\nEverything like everything around me is falling apart if something doesn't taint than I don't know what else I can do\n[noise]\n[noise] to counseling is here to help our team of license Christian counselor I Want to help you get the best we can begin a conversation when you're ready texture phone or even video conferencing from the comfort of your own home\nI'd like to give you your first week free to try faithful counseling dot com let's talk go right now to try faithful counseling dot com we really want to help you it's so easy to get started and your first week is free to go now to try faithful counseling dot com let us help attention\nHomeowners do you need cash to consolidate high interest credit card payments or pay college tuition looking dividing us home improvements without paying out of pocket you worked\nHard building up the equity in your home and total mortgage can help you access to it at some of the lowest available interest rates if you are turned on your mortgage payments but struggling with other ... you need to call total mortgage right now had one eight hundred four hundred Seventy one bar you can have the money you need them as little as seven business day festival\nWill consider every request regardless of your credit score again\nHomeowners can now get cash for any reason like paying off high interest credit card debt college tuition or even home improvements this quick cash for homeowners program I only be available for a limited time to find out for free I'm much cash you call a vibe or call today one eight hundred four hundred Seventy one by one eight hundred four hundred Seventy one by one eight hundred four hundred Seventy one far\n... gloves Englander MLS number two seven six were not available and all states additional restrictions may apply offer subject to all those ability not only a couple of qualify corporate\nGerms conditions Mary over here in today's world violent crime can victimized anyone at any time\nWhen it's your time will you be able to protect yourself and your loved ones for my personal protection I attended a training at front side the world's premier firearms printing facility located near Las Vegas and through our personal\nRelationship with ... founder and director Dr ...

as you do I think the world is so grateful to her for standing tall in the saddle day after day she is a hero and I've had the privilege of meeting her a couple of times you must just be bursting with pride over this young woman [noise]\nWell\nI Am and uh I admit freely that I'm about as objective regarding her as the New York times there's about president [laughter] so there\nIs no a pretense of objectivity but she's a tough kid and she's very good at what she does and I was in Chicago last night I was talking to some people who were telling me how much they love my daughter had great she was and and they said you know where did she get that I said well a couple of things first Chet\nTwo older brothers that were really mean to her and she had early on to the side that if she was going to survive she's gonna have to fight back in standard ground and she learned it or did she learned I mean after her brothers did things like super glue her fingers together\nYou sound like a couple of Irish sons of guns are really I Love the two of you because you you do you live your passion to use one of the cliches of our day\nBut you you use a your skills as journalists to tell these important story so for somebody who doesn't know anything about the story of Kermit got nailed obviously the movie or is just coming out now it's an important movie I Hope people will go see it desperately\nI Hope that it's where I wanted to have you want for this hour but but tell us and in Salem I'm One of the basics give us a thumbnail sketch in case somebody just tuning in they have never heard of this [noise]\nCriminal who is going ahead and a lot you know you ... go ahead and go ahead there are\nThis is this the perimeter of the ordinary or not it's just the driver I was looking at a much\nSuch isn't a picture of a marriage it's like no you go darling no you go\nAhead go ahead of\nCriminal who is an orange the doctor who\nUm is serving three life sentences and the principal in Pennsylvania for delivering babies alive and then and then cutting her next which says he did it for Thirty years with impunity\nBecause of the establishment who you who who you know who wants to protect abortion that nothing about all the warning signs even though and in fact two women died and it's like and they still did not bring\n'em so this is this ... this is the ... the movie is actually about the trial investigation on the trial if we show nothing gory it's not at all like that it's a lot like a law and order episode\nBut but I think this is like a credit card bill did I'm On a jury you know all pro pro abortion people actually over you know not pro life people convicted of murder for doing this and\nThat its own brings up a lot of questions about\nHow did he get away with it for so long to fly would a governor governor Tom Ridge a Republican governor Catholics have allowed this to happen during his during his time as governor and in fact why was it that that same governor said hands off the abortion clinics which parts of the ... to look like author Walter\nWatson discovered earlier um you know there's no question that the story brings up and not the least of which is how the media or the the top of one of the story could break was in the courts in Philadelphia how it is that most people in the country have never heard of ... name\nWell we're having in very divided times and this is this is a horror and I was if you want to know how divided they are\nA ... even when someone\nDoes a things as horrific as gruesome as this man did if it's somehow falls under the rubric of of abortion nobody wants to know the facts and in this case\nUp because we do have laws in this country we were forced to deal with the fact and this man as you said is now behind bars\nServing three life sentences I mean this is an amazing thing so what precisely was this butcher convicted of that he is now behind bars for three lifetimes if that were possible [noise] well and\nHe's you know he's convicted of murder and murder in bed but he's also killing his patients and you know he he won an abortion that was a grand jury in Philadelphia and I'm sure ... Philadelphia I've seen a lot they called it a ... of course\nI'm about to get a lot to do this the bodies were I mean the ... to ... say the bodies were piling up but they actually were literally\nPiling up in a in his in his basement or ... as we were coming out of a clinic or the authorities didn't want to do anything and I we're ... we made a movie about it\nI Want to tell people look it's not it's not a gory it's gone a horror movie it's a courtroom drama and it's about the trial it's about how ... how you go from being this mom being protected species or two detectives could detect isn't good lawyers\nRealizing this Hunan right there's something wrong here on fighting against the political backlash the media backlash\nTo bring justice to let them was in who are also is\nIf people want to know about the movie or just so ah 'cause people tune in and out of radio programs they can do to God's Nell movie dot com ... G O s N E L L God's Nell movie dot com\nUm ... what what made you think the two of you that a movie needed to be made about this he wrote a tremendous book about it I Know the book did very well and people are interested in the book uh I Would recommend highly\nAt that they get a copy of the book for all the details movies can never give those kinds of details but uh what what persuaded you to make a movie\nYou know nothing succeeds like a like a movie in in in reaching out very white audience um you know not everyone read which books they don't have time or they don't they just don't like reading um even documentaries are something that a lot of people you know don't really like\nTo watch and we actually thought you know what you know what's really popular you know the crime John ... is a very very popular in the United states but a lot of TV show with her about crime and here's a here's an incredible crime story really happened to 'em and it's a true you know it's true crime and you know at the center of it is a very impressive investigation ... you know that's going on with\nYou know that's a cop Jim lord of the central story and then you know followed up very closely by the attorneys to women relate to investigate a story and put this guy behind bars um you know it it got the you know that's that's very much that I very much the attraction\nAnd and failing did you do wreck this movie\nNo real well we've reduced as a mix seriously that veteran actor Nick ...\nA directed at you know you probably know Nick from ah from justified the TV series but also Nick Nick was an actor and the shape of water he was also in three billboards outside ebbing Missouri just just a names and you know they basically every movie you know a big movie the last\nFriday he opposed us and he said that's what he wants to do that while\nHe was he felt like this was something that he was he could do a really it's designed for him so he's still a good job um you know thank God I didn't direct it uh you know as a journalist I Would have been too concerned with you know\nMaking sure that our the thing is you know is toll exact ache well you know Nick Nick has thoughts\n... ... the story truth but he's probably allowed the stray and we'll they'll action to it um I'm told a story and that's where I Am or we want this to be accessible to people I mean are there a book was a best seller but you know that is still a limited audience but a true crime drama in America\nSure you know everyone watches out you know if you watch [noise] if you watch you know law and order you'll love this\nWhile I was going to say that uh you know to tell a story like this that it is a gruesome story but you don't need\nTo show the horror you can apply it and there have been many films a that have dealt with abortion in Morrow bleak way this is of course before roe v Wade thing became hot button and movies don't touch it anymore\nBut there was a time when you could do that the movie ... feet with ah Michael Cain and Shelly winters brilliant movie from Nineteen sixty six\nUh it deals with an abortion and it it's just one of those things I Will never forget it they don't show anything but it just conveys the horror when we come back folks I'm Talking to the authors of the book on Kermit does now and now they're behind the movie God's nail movie dot com is the website stick around\nHim
