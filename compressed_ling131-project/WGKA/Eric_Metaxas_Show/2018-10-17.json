R. M. eighty to eighty seven to two to you have a phone I Know your thumbs know how to tax just don't do it while you're driving let's get back to Gordon Gordon some very cool stuff yesterday after Alan Alan me to come up when we were discussing various things in this area yesterday said I Want to get off the air and quit working and go have some fun\nAnd we did that yesterday where did you take us yesterday\nWe did well first of all we walked over to the marshals department where he met the tombstone Marshall a very fine man ... and we invited him on the show today but unfortunately he's out chasing felons or something he's busy today so he couldn't make it a\nAfter that we went to I Believe it went to lunch with the crystal palace saloon a legendary they just built a brand new balcony upfront where it overlooks Allen Street in tombstone\nAnd I said it's a very cool about that I Know about the building that used to be excuse me I used to be the eagle brewery many many many many moons ago back in tombstone heyday and it later became Virgil herbs off this when he was deputy deputy sheriff did not\nThat's right right up in there and uh they've done a great job of keeping it up and it's it's a landmark property here in tombstone\nWhere else did we go from there we left there and went to we went to the courthouse and the court house I mean I I I've been there so many times that there's a couple of new displays in there that I didn't recognize before tell us about um there\nIs a couple of new displays a the thanks to Arab leader donated a over thirty Josephine ... letters original letters and many a wider letters or and photos excuse me photos of white or from the Nineteen twenties uh\nJust absolutely priceless and John floods original documents manuscripts who was a one of a one of the ... biographers are one of ... of people that\nAre documented or life a lot of his original material has been donated to the Tucson courthouse and it's on display for\nThe world to see there is also in addition to those letters which are fascinating they're kind of tough to read\nBut they're really cool just to look at because you can see the signatures and see some of the names and just to know some of the history behind it and where it came from to me that's enough I just think it's cool that we can look at it and see it behind the glass case but there was also a couple of very cool pocket watches there there was a little imagine they're probably worth fifty sixty bucks right yes\nThere was a there was one of supposedly wider pocket watches but there is something brand new in their Josephine ... a pocket watch and it was donated to the tombstone courthouse about two years ago or by some gentleman that stay at my motel and\nWe convince them to put it on display there and maybe maybe indefinitely and it's just a inscribed on there are two my sweetheart Josephine a\nIt a state of the state of Nineteen twenty four just shortly a few years before he died a is priceless and it's it's been a authenticated yeah that\nI I mean you know what what do you say about something like that and it's interesting because he met Josephine here in tombstone did he not and fascinating story they were married forty seven years on\nA long time that people don't realize that this is not ancient history this is fairly recent history we're talking about it I'll use myself as an example I was born in Nineteen sixty to\nEighty year old man when I was born was born in Nineteen eighty or Eighteen eighty two we are not my grandfather was born in Eighteen Ninety six we're not talking thousands of years ago this is well documented stuff you walk into the birdcage theater which I took down and today I Want you to tell us a little history of that that's quite fascinating\nBut this stuff is all here for us to stay in touch and\nFeel it's wonderful and by the way those Josephine are players one of those letters is completely fascinating\nIt describes a Josephine visit back in the Nineteen thirties the tombstone she came back after White's death to visit tombstone and there's the letter and they're describing that and that's available to look at and a ... wonderful collection and we're always looking for new items for Tucson courthouse\nThat be fifty years after the gunfight at the OK Corral probably fifty two years from the time she showed up here fifty three years and actually met him here in Tucson correct that's right\nCan you imagine Josephine are coming back uh\nThat late date Nineteen thirties and you know everyone's gone you know every now and probably even knows who wider is that at that time but uh it's just fascinating to think that she actually travelled here after his death\nAnd what the town must have looked like her that you know it was a whole lot different from the in the Nineteen\nThirties tombstone was in rough shape we're going through the great depression and uh\nMining was gone and uh it was a pretty much goes down then so I'm sure she was shocked from boom towns it goes down but we survived\nYou know the town historian who we met at the crystal palace yesterday was quite fascinating and he talked about something I was completely unaware of and that was the second mining boom\nHere in in the city I I had no I'd never I did not know that I thought when the when the mind flooded when the town burn that that was it and it was over but that's not necessarily the case about twenty some years later they see Nineteen twenty nine there was another boom there\nWas a boom or right before World War one I Believe\nThey were getting strategic minerals in this area and it didn't have to mining boobs and uh the mining history of tombstone often gets overlooked I mean people think of the gun fights and the bad\nAnd the good guys and then the cowboys and the Indians but really what Bill to my son was the mining and that's and chef one came here in Eighteen Seventy Seventy and uh he he is the one that built up to basically started tombstone it\nBuilt up tombs on which tunes on what was the original first name do you know\nYou're going to embarrass me on my radio I should know that we talked about that\nOkay is ... ... I did not know that I did not know guy should I should know that it will you know I was going to actually say something along the lines of contention because that was the biggest strike and the most valuable mine and tombstones valued at over thirty million I Believe than at the time which is a ton of money today\nBut it just notably ed shovel and by the way so that contention\nFor three hundred thousand dollars a wound up producing you're only thirty million dollars is that right dead chef one made millions\nOh ours in tombstone and and that was a course a huge it was a huge amount today but then it was you know you were like a Bill Gates type of person really very very wealthy [noise] yeah I Do sweats where did that come from I Need to know that\nI I think that was right very initially that was initially called goose flat because this area where we're at right now is a flat area and\nHe gave him someone came up a name goose flats and then at shift and change it to tombstone which you know the story tell us your story about tombstone\nWow that of course was we've talked about it a lot and that was of course would have to kind of coming out of Fort what you can you know the town of ... students don't all that fun stuff but yeah the whole do sweat thing I had no idea there's something else about this area that most people really don't know about there is a town about thirty five miles south of here right near the Mexican border read pretty much on the Mexican border and ah\nIs in the book is is the new book\nMaybe we should write one you know Donald builds the wall okay Donald goes to space I don't know it's it's a whole series on anything is a Donald the caveman book it's a series Donald a caveman and of course gave me a good thing so today's the day last night we had our fun live signing how much fun was that\nOh always a good time on\n... like that that's a a blast um I think you can I can you say like a good time and a half because I worked overtime really you know I'm OK Now by the way I could buy more book if you listen to the program yesterday you heard me interview the comedian he's\nHe's brilliant Michael junior\nAnd ah and we're going to have part two with him in a couple of minutes I mean as I said he so good I Want to just keep talking so we're gonna play that a couple of minutes Michael junior our to the great David ... brother of Russ\nLimbaugh who yeah um yeah you've heard of Rush Limbaugh go yeah um okay so\n[laughter] I don't know I got I got a Michael junior to laugh he got you'd assign a book the miracles book yeah he said I'm going to sell us on B. E. bay and he laughed I said you know one oddly enough you can get more money on on E. bay if it's not signed in America\nSo people have said the same kind of longer laugh at that although technically it's funny I'm\nHey somebody tweeted the other day on Twitter copied me and said that get her when taxes has miracles book\nSigned copy of miracles but kind of ... and I clicked on it takes you to ... and he was selling a signed copy of my miracles book he was and I thought this guy's like marketing on Twitter you know to he really is one of the areas yeah well whatever you want to get more without\nAssigned to pay a guy okay well I got a lot to talk about the fact that my book is launching today or is it really is important\nTo me so I'm very excited about it and I want to remind folks uh if you're thinking of getting a copy or copies for Christmas or whatever if you buy them\nThe week that it comes out which is to say today or tomorrow or it goes to the first week of the ... when they when they put together the best seller list so\nI I always say to friends do me a favor if you're going to buy the book you know buy it now you know because it it goes the first week is is the most is the best option for a ... for us to get\nA on the bestseller list so I just want to say that ah it's important to me if you're thinking of buying it that you would buy it this week and of course you get the first edition and the first printing 'em I actually think this is going to be a thing and I think people are gonna I think next Halloween\nKids are going to go out dressed as Donald the caveman that could be oh no I'm telling you you're going to be down all the caveman with Andrew boxes really pillows we know that\nMy pillow yeah which is our friend Michael Dell they're creating their sending us there you know whatever and at the end of the book Donald the caveman book the dumb brained just want book he basically said they they said hey we want you to be a new king and he goes no it's kinda like George Washington says no\nI don't want to be you can you free now you're free people and a free people you don't have a king king tells people what to do and they have to do it but a free people tell the leaders what to do and the leaders have to do it and they say to him oh you mean like a president he goes yeah and if that's what you're looking for um your caveman yeah and so\nHe says I'm your caveman so we're making pillows that say he's my caveman and it's got Donald the caveman on there so Michael in del in my pillows going to be making these\nAvailable it's hilarious I mean just the fact that we've got we've got merchandise yeah and we're in we're having dolls made up I still haven't supposed to see it today that I was close to see today everybody do Erica solid and get some books and keep this thing wrong well I I Do if it hits the bestseller list obviously that would be tremendous but I don't even know what category they're going to put it in\nLike I guess just humor books I don't know because it looks like a children's book so maybe I don't know any way I I don't want to forget to mention speaking of America mhm I'm we're doing a something with the alliance defending freedom a lot of people know that religious liberty is\nUnder attack in America every time you turn around somebody's being challenged\nA for their face and it's it's really\nAn odd thing because the less people are aware of what the constitution actually says\nAnd aware of what our laws actually say with regard to religious liberty the more they're inclined to say oh I don't want to get in trouble and ... and and by the way you then give it's kinda like showing fear to add to it to a wild animal you know and the human Bolden them you have to fight\nFor what is right religious liberty is key things alliance defending freedom they're the premier organization the United states\nThat fights for religious liberty so if you have a\n... year being attacked at your job we we had on Calvin talk when he was the\nHe was the fire chief in Atlanta incredible human being African American hero I mean this guy was was intact terrific you know early on in his career races and whatever so he rises to become\nYou know American success story whatever he\nWrites a small book for men's Bible study and mentions of biblical view of sexuality right yeah well somebody in the same sex community an activist didn't like it came after him he\nLost his job he was thirty five years in the department rises to become this big deal that he was gotten awards by Obama and go all these things raises a hero lost his job because somebody said you know what you're a big it I don't like you know and so we're living in a time where if you don't fight that\nYou know the whole country is going to fall apart you have to understand when when we ... we all have to fight together otherwise we're all going to lose together so basically the alliance defending freedom is doing that they're winning they won a number of times they argued and one Supreme Court level but they do this for free so if you come to them and say I got a problem there I can say ah\nLet's see let's see the money you know that they're not like some gum shoes that says that right give me a hundred dollars per diem and I'll uh I'll see what I can do no they say we will do this because it's right so they depend on\nOur donations so I'm asking you folks\nTo go to our website attacks us talk dot com and you'll see it much taxes talk dot com there's a banner who knew he'd give out that banner every penny you give will be doubled so this is why I'm urging you to do it now well there's a matching grant if you don't do it now or it's not doubled so\nAh one once this or is taken away though there's nothing I can tell you so please go to the lines of an freedom better ma taxes talk I'm more hey here's a phone number eight hundred\nFive five six twenty seven Seventy eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy do the right\nThing folks if we do not vote with our dollars if we don't give a little something we can't really complain when religious liberty falls apart by the way when religious liberty for the part that's just the way of saying\nLiberty falls apart the country falls apart these are these fundamental things that if you don't protect is a than than that the people that\nDon't understand these things that think your big it for thinking biblical ... they're going to win and by the way every American loses if those people when this is not us versus them this is about what the constitution says\nI'm so go to ... dot com and click on the ... defending freedom or before we come back with Michael junior yes Alvin have I mentioned that my book launches today no weight which book is this now you know it's a new one kind of humor book it's meant to be fun so I I Hope people will get this\nFor their liberal friends yeah because as a fun things like say come on ...\nOn his way or it's called Donald dreams are all done yeah it's called Donald drain the swamp as the Donald a caveman book age illustrated by my friend Tim rag Lynn and by the way he wrote it with me so anybody who thinks oh that's clever that's really funny Eric and I can say well guess what\nTim thought of that because it kept him as he's like he's a genius so uh it's based on a true story and I hope people will will say you know Eric because the books coming up today we'd like to get a coffee the today show on a true folk hero Iran's right that's right that's a folk hero alright folks when we come back we're talking to Michael\nJunior uh and uh we'll be right back with my dear we're gonna have some laugh with him [noise]\nAh haven't [noise]\n\nAm nine twenty the U.S

I didn't understand why I didn't have a taste for it but then\nAfter after some years went by and I really got my own voice and clearly know who I Am in common I\nSuddenly I wanted to watch comedy and I realized what was going on is I Would have been influenced will correct by those others ... but not even knowing it and even some of my friends some of that you would know when I watched her comedy I can see who may watch when they were ... when they were\nNot you could have ended up being like the black Sam kennison and yeah and nobody wants to see that\nYeah you know what I mean or a ... I could have been smashing like fruit and stuff [noise] I don't see that half hour and ... or some ... [laughter] yeah oh no\nOh my gosh smash them for yeah I'm now let me ask you something uh I'm asking the question asked him for because you didn't answer it when you were a kid growing up and you're watching people on TV or whatever who did you connect with and say I think he's funny I Want to be like that\nYeah when I was a kid I wasn't thinking about comedy is that right so you didn't watch\nI don't know J. J. Walker you didn't watch a wall of the heck I mean who all have on TV and find them funny all maternal deserve lecture ozone is I Would just have right now\nI just assumed that because you're black comedian you might have had some you know you actually meeting for very long only well oh here's where you're going to tell me oh Bob Newhart was my biggest influence no maybe I don't know\n... into the dog's your very surreal ... I'm trying to ask knew who were your like Steven Wright has that story building ruined why no he is in Berlin and you're a little bit like that\nYeah your hair is different but you are a little bit like that Steven race because we're so close really not interesting but but you um so you don't have anybody like that that you say like that wanted out\nDo you love to watch right now who's still go to me uh Brian Regan\nIs Tara yes he is um and clean Jim gaffe against hysteria and gap again is also clean he's a Christian I Know Jim but to um talk out when you were a jail under generous as he has and she's also clean\nBecause my comedy comedy actually comes from a when I was a kid I used to struggle more reading\nLike I ... up in a quiz is really bad start to look at worst differently like I'm Talking about even in middle school\nHave I'd have to look at the ... and the color to positioning what's in front of what's behind it how people responded to it actually came up with seven different ways to look at a word to determine what to where it was you know Joe ... got really good at it to the point in high school people did not wasn't really reading I was just working out really really fast now as an adult are we just fine\nBut I still got disability look at words and people in situations seven different ways almost immediately and that's the primary play supplement company for\nYou know you are right on your genius you I'm not kidding you're genius you have a you have an ability to see I remember ... when I heard you to comedy at one point you went into this in depth he told a story and I realized that that's just a free T gift like when you have\nIt is but I mean it could be a curse but it's a gift in your case using it for me right like because sometimes people they don't ask to see things the way they see them or I just to kind of a gift but you're able to turn in the ...\nFirst person to call me a genius really kind of touched me a little\nTrue promise you I'll be the last because people need to be geniuses themselves to recognize ... appreciation for working directly [laughter] let's see if I had far no probably as well but I mean I\nI Try not to use words like that lately I I think it's true that you have you have a a you have\nGift and that's what enables you to be funny even the way you talk about humor in here thinking about it you're looking at it and he's been a lot I mean it's it's just an instinctive thing mhm and they they have never thought about it they just know how to do it would have to\nThere's two things I've learned that really so whenever you someone laugh to retain more information rather just they just simply do retain like at least I think he's thirty eight percent more information that's why Super Bowl commercials are so funny they always make them funny because he wants to remember their product well\nThat's what I Do comedy if I'm if people if their hearts are open\nI like to make a deposit so even for example in the movie a morning funny we were making a deposit were strategically making a deposit into people\nEven though it's Ninety seven percent funny but people will be mood or as a as a result of this like just eight year olds who come to my shows who are laughing and then even crying as a result of some of the stuff that we share in between\nThe gym they step drinking a drug in and they go into comedy they do even the eight year olds\n... year we're reaching your hours and say hey you need to get your your life together\nSo you do not so ... I I'm just fascinated that I Want to ask you is like a simple question like that you would ask any comedian like three years has gone up you you're kind of telling me you didn't have any\nYou know I respect of budget comedians and really enjoy watching them now but now I think about the war there were influence meaning they influenced my style like it was they had a big cause me to change my ... and they\nDidn't really happen I just had my own I just stayed away from it but I didn't want to I just literally couldn't I just didn't have the desire was weird but now looking back at in retrospect I'm really happy because\nThe way I'm doing comedy hasn't been done before not the comedy itself but the but the extra stuff that we're doing in between the jokes\nRight well you are you also realize

their purpose in life\nIs so presumptuous when you think about it that I that I decided to do that and it's so daunting and I don't mean that facetiously I mean who am I to be doing this uh\nYou know those people who know you are thinking exactly the [laughter] thinking you know what I Know David and this doesn't make any human scent it's gotta be God that's that's the only explanation but then everybody knows you're not that talented oh and not that smart to lead has to be ... how how do you explain it\nI'm merely a vessel that as as a doctor titled set a pastor and an instrument of God's Grace you know it's it's um\nI don't know because I I I wrote the first Christian book and the man I well there are so many people more dollars willing and better at this than I Am and yet it came together in a way that I think was accessible to people that my buddies couldn't my buddy the illusion or pastors could probably not a very it's a lot of them he couldn't\nAnd then I got the courage to do the next one about the Old Testament the pointing to Christ\nAnd I did the gospels and I don't know I really don't know every time I finish a book I go I didn't write that somebody else wrote that I couldn't do that and the same thing with this one I go before I START I can't do this I got a call ... I I I signed a contract but I'm just kidding\nAnd but then I get into and I study immerse myself in in ... yes I can do this again and now I'm doing now twenty four seven violating the Sabbath four months to a to derive these things\nI don't know I just feel like there's there's something or to studying this and sharing it in a way of people that are on the level that I was I have an enthusiasm that I Want to impart to them or I think I can help set some people on fire and I've I've gotten great feedback on that\nI'm from a lot of readers and I don't know I don't it's just kind of my niche I Do think it's pretty bizarre that I'm doing this without having any formal\nTraining although it's not as I listen to you know I'm teasing you I I did the same thing okay and of course you know we'd be arrogant fool not to have a moment of doubt and humility and to say indeed who am I to tell the story about\nThe same time a scripture is full of stories where God just tell people to do stuff and they say oh I Can't do it in the end of the fact of the matter is if God has called you to do something you do it in obedience and you trust him with the results in the back of the matter is that you uh\nHave a gift of communication I find interesting your your brother\nIs it rush rush rush also as a gift of communication and when you have a gift to communication which I I Am by God's Grace also have you want to use it\nTo help people and sometimes you can write a book on a on a subject people write books on subjects just like this book\nAnd it doesn't saying it doesn't speak it it's sort of the kind of thing that it's a it's an effort to get through it and uh your books are not that way and and I really am glad that you've taken the time to write them because we all need someone to hold her hand to walk us through the scriptures that's what\nThis is ... thank you and you know when I was in this this maybe I said this for I don't think I did but um I I feel like I'm I Wish I had someone when I was first hungry and learning I Wish there was a short cut I Want to consume I Want to inhale the Bible and the theological knowledge\nAnd and I don't know how to do it I I just groped around and I kept finding I kind of did it the hard way get studying things and I think I have I Do think I have a gift to discern where I can kinda tell what's out there and what's mainstream what's reliable so I've been I think I've been blessed with that\nAnd so and I am telling that not regular 'cause I Want to convince readers that I'm not one of those people that are out there you can trust this step it's mainstream theology and biblical thinking and\nI just feel like I was in that position where I wanted to learn so these books that I write or what I Wish I Would have had access to myself somebody written I'm sure there are books like that that I didn't see that these are my version of what I Wish I had had a Twenty years ago when I was starting 'cause it would have really accelerated my learning curve\nIt's it's so funny to hear you say this because I Swear I'm not making this up I wrote\nA three books of apologetic uh everything always wanted to know about God but were afraid to ask everything else he was on tobacco free to got to ask and then the last one is diseases edition everything about God and I I wrote them exactly for the same same reason I said to myself when I was in my twenties or whatever\nI didn't I never heard any of this stuff I just went blind and and when I finally became a Christian you know I found some great books but\nI think a lot of times people write books because they wish they had had such a thing when they were younger and that is why I wrote my apologetic books of what's why still write what I write but then you realize that there's a need\nFor something a for people who were hungry and the fact is that\nThere there may be a lot of books but a lot of them are not accessible a lot of them are written for the layman you know uh and so I ... that that's why I'm so grateful you've taken the trouble to go through scripture like this verse by verse now for somebody knows nothing about Paul in the early church people listening\nNow there is there anything about it Paul in the early church what are we talking about what year what's going on ... give us the broad you know picture up\nWell a Christ split history in half by the way another convincing proof of his existence uh they they ... they reorient the time so Christ was born what six B. C. to BCS zero BC whatever\nAnd Paul was pretty much the same age and uh after Christ was crucified and resurrected but in a sense that\nPaul was around ... as a an ardent Jew and a follower of the law and a student of of Judaism and he was a persecuted of the church and so he's in his mid thirties probably early thirties\nAnd um he's going around outraged that Jews are accepting Christ is the messiah when he knows he knows that can't be\nTrue but I I remember when I learned this I I remember I learned this summer I came to faith now I've been an altar boy in church every week and it just shows you going to church you may learn nothing because what for whatever reason but I remember when I learned that the apostle Paul St Paul\nBefore he became the great leader of the Christian faith that we know he was persecuting Christians I ... when I learned that I thought\nYou want to talk about conversion ... holy cow this was one of the smartest people of his day he was a genius in terms of the scriptures he studies in the mail yet the biggest ensure of the time so he was\nPaul was an absolute genius one of the smartest most effective uh you know a a Bible people of his day Old Testament people of his day and he was using his faith and his knowledge to persecute\nChristians so one day he has this thing happened to him and will you you tell the story I mean this is like unbelievable except we know what actually happened\nHe and let me this as a background that let me tell you why he believes that Judaism is authentically from God that that that Jews are God's chosen people by the way you and I believe that as well by the way Jesus believe that any who's a Jew and and and all that was true everything you learned was true\nBut then the Christians come along Christ comes along you can't be the messiah because he was dies on a tree he's hung on a tree which Old Testament scripture says you're cursed if you do\nHe was also supposed to deliver them aside was supposed to deliver a military and political victory Christ went down an editor defeat and humiliation uh apparently\nAnd he he couldn't possibly be what they were were looking for so no this couldn't have happened\nSo Paul doesn't just think the Christians are not a threat they're starting a a a religion even a competing religion that would have been okay no they're twisting his religion and the word of God that's a serious affront in his defense I don't blame him for being outraged because that's what he was\nTaught to believe so he's on a mission to imprison kill 'em persecute them he's on his way to Damascus\nHe ask for permission from the religious as religious authorities in Jerusalem to arrest these heritage in Damascus and on his way there he's blinded with a\n... because they were going to come right back folks we can tell you the rest of the story this is Eric my taxes show\nUse opinion inside am nine twenty she and her\nStock options trading about financial risk and it's not feasible for all investors guy\nScott power here CEO prosper training academy are you looking for a super hot stock to cure it prosper we're always looking for exciting opportunities in the markets and right now all my students are salivating over the stock we're watching in fact I've got this hot stock written down right here and I'm about to Texas to you for free I just need to know where to send it\nSimply tech hot too for eight five four to ... to instantly how do I noticed stock is so hot\nWell I'm a former CBS market maker for Amazon options former vice president of Goldman Sachs and I have over twenty five years of professional\nTrading experience I'm telling you this stock is hot but be warned stock may move soon so you need to claim it before it does tech hot to four eighty five for to test you this hot stock instantly text hot to forty five for two and a taxi this hot stock instantly message and data rates may apply\n[noise] [noise] well I [noise]\n\nI Need help I've been feeling so low I just need someone to talk to [noise]\nNobody understands me I feel so alone [noise]\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Eric Metaxas Show", "city": "Atlanta", "day": "17"}
