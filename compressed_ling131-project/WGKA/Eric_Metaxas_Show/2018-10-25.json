R. Hawkins Georgia he's put a couple of pieces out on Georgia why why is it W. R. Hawkins of Breitbart News writing about Georgia because all countries watching the race down here\nIt was as predictable again as the day is long I predicted it right after the the primaries here in the state of Georgia when Brian Kemp won the nomination\nAnd will be going up against Stacey Abrams a radical leftist professional gun prohibition is who hate your right to bear arms who hate your freedoms and your capitalism and wants to take all your money increase our taxes and take away our gun that's what she's running that's not me telling you that that's the that's that's what the black woman she's running on\nAnd I told you it wouldn't be long\nBefore the left will be out there with their headlines creating the narrative it wasn't twenty four hours later\nWhen I Believe it was time magazine put her on the cover and said ... George W turning blue good heavens man to headlines W. R. Hawkins number one Democrat Stacey Abrams sheiks ban on entire category of firearms and repeal of campus carry a number one\nThe second headline Stacey Abrams sponsored bill to ban and sees commonly own semi automatic firearms we'll start with the first one Democrat Stacey Abrams does what\nSeeks a ban on an entire category of firearms and repeal of campus carry she is running on his pledge\nTo ban an entire category of firearms and repeal the campus carry laws that allow concealed permit holders to be armed on campus for self defense let me remind you listener that over the last two weeks there has been eight scores of crime on Georgia's downtown campuses\nAnd students talking about arming themselves they see Abrams doesn't like that idea also let's go back and think for just a second on how many how many of those well by the students that carry guns how many\nNegligent discharges of their bed how many suicides everybody ... oh no that's right because their production of doom and gloom doesn't happen\nBut that's not good enough for Stacey Abrams she just doesn't like guns period\nEven in the hands of good guys unless they're protecting huh you see how that works\nShe wants to implement according to a W. R. Hawkins other gun controls including universal background checks she doesn't even know what that means so I'll tell you what it means\nIt means forcing you to get government permission to sell guns to everybody and anybody in private sales so you're a hunting buddy to your dad to your neighbor I don't care what they tell you that's what their goal is that is what universal background checks are\nUniversal background checks don't work because they cover private sell out of the government know\nThat I sold a gun to my neighbor bill they're not going to know because I'm going to sell done to my neighbor bill period\nI don't need the government's permission to do it\nBut wait a minute the government's going to step in and say well how do we know that he's abiding by our newest man made\nLaw well gosh darn we have to register these guns so that we have a record of everyone who has them and where they wind up to natural progression\nWhat they're not telling you the AJC Atlanta Journal constitution\nIs indicating according to a W are\nThe Abrams ignoring Democrats previous Abbott running as moderate on guns now pushing for gun control once elected\nInstead she is literally running on a gun control platform in other words she ate heightened it and like the rest of embolden Democrats emboldened by a press giving tremendous amount of coverage to people like David hog\nAnd the marches and everything else while ignoring the vast majority of Americans\nOver a hundred plus million Americans while binding Americans that are gun owners ignoring us painting a picture creating a narrative\nThat is giving the the Democrats the socialists embolden ing them to feel that they can openly run on a gun grabbing campaign bring it on good luck with that at all I Want them to continue running on that you should to let\nThem by the way here's what the Atlanta Journal constitution that heading over to their pay is Stacey Abrams another leading Democrats\nThey're broken from decades of conventional party strategy in Georgia in this year's midterms let me stop there for a second that means lie and hiding what they want to do that with the agency is telling you they've stopped lying in hiding in waiting until they get in power that's what they're telling you right there without saying I'm saying\nIs that what they're selling\nBy calling for new firearms restrictions Abrams in others they voters shell shocked from a state of mass shootings are now more supportive of her calls for universal background checks for private sales and firearms a ban on high powered assault rifles and the repeal of campus gun legislation\nYou think that's going to happen in Georgia you think we're going to repeal campus carry you know what is required to do that\nDo you think we're going to ban high powered assault rifles in the state of Georgia and do you think that we hear the voters and George are going to allow the government to tell me who I can and cannot sell gun to last I pay them a tax to do so\nYou know you don't touch Wilkerson delivers the you know the opening to each of these shows yet okay well guess what I did yesterday go on I guess you met with him I knew you would guess\nYes yes I met with that said and you know in person yes he's a lot less nasty really yes well you know it's incredible he's like a normal person and he's friendly and I just didn't have it in me\nTo address him down for his main comment is so nice\nHe knows you would clean his clock\nIn fairly oh you're not ... yeah you're not kitten and I'm ...

I've been doing a lot of media\nAround the Donald rains swamped book it's why I'm Out here yesterday did the Huckabee show\nI'd never heard of what could be a no ... we have was the governor\nOf Arkansas and now he has a TV show on TBN\nGovernor Huckabee interviewed me was it was a remote I mean I was you know in the studio but he interviewed me and he's another one he's so friendly and this morning I did the Rick and bubba show have you heard of working Baba\nI have yeah have you heard about her I heard a both\nAnd what about Rick well anyway I was on the brick and bubba show there are a couple of good old boys from Birmingham, Alabama they interview so I've just been doing a lot of media and stuff that's why I'm Out here that's what I'm Talking to you on the phone instead of in Studio ... just want to explain\nSpleen it you do okay that's\nGood All right we we we have a lot of ground to cover up and how are we going to do is first of all I'm\nA friend of mine emailed us about he he he had an idea and I also posted this on my Facebook page and I think on Twitter he\nHad his friend is name is Jeff Bernstein and he he's a New Yorker and he's a friend of mine he had an idea and I don't know what I think the idea genuinely genuinely I I'm not sure what I make of it but I thought\nLet me posted on Twitter and Facebook ticket comments and the idea was that what if we hired people from this caravan to build the wall like kind of a crazy idea\nBut he he kind of explains it and I posted that on his way we'll talk about that in in our two today 'cause I think we have some time in our too but I just thought it was a fascinating idea which today was calling jokes I'd love to know what my\nUh listeners think hey listeners debt that you I'd love to know what you think but anyway ... no [laughter] we uh\nWe're also do em I forget anything oh my gosh\nWell don't tend to uh well you might want to get into ATF because we're willing to little behind on that\nWe're not a little behind were very behind you know well votes alright listen uh the clock is still picking a in this campaign so let's just say that we're in the final phase of the campaign or I Wish you weren't the final phase because we're so far behind but I thought maybe we could get somebody from ATF\nOr to talk about you know what it's like working at ATF\nThis is again is about religious liberty so we got Bob twin he's the vice president of public relations at ATF and we asked him you know what is it like to work for organizations that protect religious freedom for all Americans for free which is why we need to to help them out by giving something let's play that clip\nGetting to know our clients jak ... a chief Cochran in Atlanta ... in Kentucky a beer standing up for everybody's freedom\nOf big could have made an easy choice and just gone along with what the government was telling me to do in a compromising their beliefs and they were not willing to do that or I just got a great amount of satisfaction knowing each day that we can to stand along a and beef and people like that because what they're doing\nA is an example in protects all of us\nWell there you go now that is Bob uh Trent so he's with allies with any freedom but now he also says that\nThat the mission of alliance defending freedom is to provide free\nLegal services and by the way this is like first class they they can argue all the way the Supreme Court they've done it many times this is for victims of people who've been discriminated based on their religious beliefs right so listeners like you folks this is my audience without you there would not be any alliance defending freedom here's another clip from buck Trent\nWe exist because of the tax deductible donations that people in your listeners provide us and right now there's a donor a friend of ... who's believed to double match every gift is given during this campaign there's not that much time left in Raleigh fifty percent goal\nSo we're a gift of a hundred dollars two hundred dollars a thousand dollars right now\nWill help alliance defending freedom defend your listeners freedom\nAnd provided the funds that are critical to fighting battles for our most fundamental freedoms\nWhile okay so I Hope folks that you you would step up today because we were more than fifty percent behind in and our goal I think that he may he was talking about the overall campaign [noise] um I I Know this is important uh for America so let me put the pressure on that way if you want to call it's eight hundred\nFive five six twenty seven Seventy eight hundred\nFive five six twenty seven\nSeventy or obviously go to my taxes talk dot com\nAnd click on the ATF banner everything you get is doubled album when we come back we're talking to Janet Smith got many ... this is a very very important\nConversation I Hope people will really a tune into this and I think at the end of the hour we'll have some more time a lot more to talk about All right ed keep listening thank you [noise]\nTwenty two year term\n[noise] well [noise]\n\nI Need help I've been feeling so low I Need someone to talk to [noise]\nNobody understands me I feel so alone [noise]\n\nGo to counseling is here to help our team of license Christian ... want to help\nYou get this we can begin a conversation when you're ready texture phone or even video conferencing from the comfort of your own home I'd like to give you your first we free\nAnd something that's happening once a beautiful thing that happened with the pro life ... of course was evangelicals and Catholics working shoulder to shoulder you and\nIt's been fantastic for for both parties I think that even ... discovered that\nCatholics on whatever they thought we were um\nRemember members of ... members of a cult I think is a member of his term yeah well no I have to say that it it takes a intellectual leadership and in the case of evangelicals\nAre we have to tip perhaps to France has shape or in the Nineteen sixties he was the one who really helped a evangelical Christians\nUnderstand that the Catholics had been far ahead of this ... head of us and that we needed to join for first of all we need to get on the right page with regard to abortion and understand that this is something that God calls the church to stand up for life and so I'm thrilled to see fifty years\nAh not just that the humidity day but it but after friends is a\nA Schaffer was talking about this that most evangelicals do understand\nThat unborn life is human life and that we have to stand up for it but most or many evangelicals still don't have in the beginning of an idea of why within marriage they shouldn't use contraception and I've had many conversations as I said I'm an evangelical but I I it's so interesting how we buy into\nKind of what the world is selling unless somebody really says no\nThat's not okay we just going to buy into it and they don't even they don't even think about it and there they say oh and you know we've been married five years but we're we're not having kids yet and I think\nWow where did you get the idea\nThat you could do that like don't you understand that marriage\nMeans kids and means family and if if God doesn't bug me with kids that's one thing but the idea that you're going to pick and choose you could say well we want to have one point seven kids just because we think we can afford it and stuff and I think you're not really trust in God and and this is very controversial but I think it's important to one of the reason I Want to have young\n[laughter] I ... in a well exactly exactly and ... ... ... ... and ... Catholics support so much from each other through the whole like move on I mean Catholics have been very um [noise]\nWhat are you going to say at a fide by this radical commitment of evangelicals to typing I'm\nIn a very radical commitment to basically leading the Bible every day and we were sort of saying well wait a second well where are we on us and so\nIt's not just for that reason but for many reasons a biblical studies have just gone through the sky among Catholics I mean almost in so many are now taking part of some Bible study group [noise] um well in my lifetime is a new\nWay it is one and we learn from each other for forgive forgive me a Gen and we're just at a time in the segment folks were going to be right back I'm Talking to Janet Smith the new book is why humanity v day is still right this is the metabolism attacks and talk on the ground Mm\nNews opinion inside am nine twenty two year term\nOr there's a half a sauce the FBI says five packages containing exposes targeting Henry Clinton former president Bob of CNN and others are being analyzed at the bureau's lab in Virginia\nBut they say to people have died in the shooting at a Kroger grocery store or the outskirts of Louisville, Kentucky police say it appears the woman who was shot and killed was not targeted a suspect was arrested\nWhen there was a two house committees have postponed an interview that was scheduled Wednesday with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein Mexican federal police have been stopping some many buses and removing people from the caravan\nOf Central American migrants even though they had said affairs David Price paid sick settings or three hit ball that major league RBI leader JD Martinez broke a setting tie in another two out rally to lead the Boston Red Sox to afford to victory over the\nIf you have a home security system it might keep your home and family they followed turned on but what else does it do for you\nI'm Ellie one of the founders of alarm dot com when we started the company more than Fifteen Years ago we wanted to create smarter or reliable secured the kind of security we'd want for our homes and families that play alarm dot com delivers planted solutions that are tested by nearly six million homes and businesses\nAlarm dot com systems are available through license security experts across the U.S who have experienced designing and dying in monitoring smart home system in your community this means you have an effort to help you understand the options and answer any question\nOnce you decide on the third Homer business security system that meet your needs those same at birth and sell your system so it's working correctly from day one and with twenty four seven professional monitoring they make sure you stay protected\nGet real protection today visit alarmed that Tom slash music to find an alarm dot com service provider in your area that alarm dot com slash music\nSchool in Roswell on line and D.C Catholics dot org friday night football Roger you buy the chick fillet college football hall of fame\nAnd the following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nMy story begins with that a lot of debt credit card debt and I hurt a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're in depth and you need help called trinity one eight hundred nine nine ... six nine seven six when\nI first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I look at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life would go way\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts into one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nWould I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable and easy it is to pay off your debt\nSaturday nine o'clock nine twenty the answer and biz eleven Ninety Sundays at ten that's we stir up Atlanta real estate joined us what you want to ask whether\nOvernight lows around forty nine with a little bit of wind out their Thursday's looking pretty good partly sunny skies high here in fifty eight Thursday night expect them rein lows around forty some the weather center empty on I thought gee now\nLive from the AM nine twenty the answer studios in bucket it's fifty one degrees just\nOne more than that I don't want to draw no you got to tell me download our mobile\nEvents contests promotions on demand all the\nYour smartphone free down to the items or Android app\n\nJust no\n[noise]\n... [noise] uh\nI don't know what ... talking about we're talking about a different kind of love the biblical New Testament love a gap I Love I don't think Mickey doing is singing about that right then but I Can't quibble with Mickey because he's not in the room on the phone but I have Janet Smith on the line Janet Smith is the author of of many books uh\nUh praised by people like the current pope Mary Eberstadt a you know we've had her on the program and Jenna we were just talking about how evangelicals and Catholics have not only worked together\nOn issues of life or and or sexuality in so many things that we have to deal with in this country but we learn from each other and you were just talking about how many Catholics in many who are friends of mine who have um\nAdopted things that you know maybe fifty years ago Catholics weren't doing like Bible studies or whatever so it is kind of wonderful to see the church being unified in that sense yes\nAnd and another thing that uh I don't know if it's still true some time ago that I heard that\nBut because of the ... and you know the wonderful collaboration with evangelicals and Catholics on life matters um\nThat evangelicals we're discovering natural family planning and in talking with faithful Catholics who said you know there is an oil to manager family size that does not all these you know really vicious chemical for the woman put you in your body that are very harmful so many ways and doesn't\nYou know involved devices that you know they're they're called protection wants it protection against what and\nYou know protection against new life he said wait a second um but that natural family planning works by people timing their sexual intercourse so that um if if it's a good idea not to have another baby and sometimes that is certainly the case that another baby would not be really responsible act\nThat you can still engage in an active sexual or low cost and making low right\nUm my and I start stopped wanting to say sexual intercourse for ... people I Want to say it's making love sometimes it's okay to make laws without making babies right but you can't work against the\nRight people don't get that I Want I Want to be clear there because people often or they are you saying you know sex is only for procreation and you think will know however what you just said when you make it definitely not about procreation some you're doing something that is I guess at least a natural\nNatural and really reduced the meaning of the sexual act\nOr a sexual act I mean it has made it so that sometimes a sexual act does not reduce the result in life he's done it that way\nHe's made it that that for two thirds amongst a woman really is in there no baby can come about because there is no egg present or right in fact there is an egg present only twenty four hours every month and it can be fertilized we're only twelve hours\nOf people don't even know that they exist or believe the existence and think that the people that have a must be some are really special special people\nIn a way they are not when they started but ... ... maybe ... special special people some people look at people ate and I can say oh my gosh I could never do that I'm having such a hard time with just two\nAnd I just watched the studies that show that was probably the hardest right and then you have number three four five six seven when it might just in a sense it still remains heart but you got that many more hands got he's got that me more skills\nHe's got that many really changed your values your values aren't they need every kid needs a brand new computer in every kid needs a ... bike in every kid needs to talk of the line that\nIt can be very happy with hand me downs and you know ... and neighbors give you things that kids are\nMost families lots of kids have gone by us full of mice close in bags but people given them because they only two kids and my spikes and all sorts of things so I think that um people have to see that I have a talk with his called on the family as a path to holiness that\nGod wants every human being to be holding\nHe doesn't mean of course just for priests and nuns and ministers\nOver by the holy and since most people marry and have children\nIt seems logical to conclude that God would actually made the film itself marriage and the ... the holiness and as you have more children you become more and more generous more and more open to diversity and ... and re kid is so different and and you have to learn how to cope with all these different people and\nAnd then you make their friends and the the the children of their friends and families and the huge community belts where you're rooting for everybody I just I Love to go to sporting events with where there's all these families and everybody knows every kid's name everybody's rooting for every kid and that goes on for a long time we have a lot of kids\n[laughter] that's a good it it no it is so beautiful and what people often don't talk about is it whenever you the bigger the family the more you have what I call a family culture if a company become like a a little tribe and you're all ... you you you see also just uh you know we've only been blessed\nWith our one daughter but I thought to myself\nThe more kids you have the more you see what your genes and your spouse's genes can produce and it's it's fascinating\nTo see brothers and sisters from the same parents in some ways similar in some ways totally different if this panoply of a you know gene expression and you should just almost laugh at how different they can help you and you know you see that when you have a lot of kids and there's as I said there's a kind of a culture\nIn families when the family is larger and there's something\nI Would argue inherently joyful about that or at least there there's a great possibility of joy in these large families and we don't see that so much whenever I have seen it\nI have to say I I just applauded and it's been wonderful\nYeah and I I Do want to stress that you don't have to have a large going to live large family values but it\nComes very well actually in a large family it's almost you know enforced it's you know everybody who has a child instantaneously becomes less selfish and more self giving him more a more generous you have to have someone depends on your twenty four hours a day where we have\nEight or nine people that are four five six people that depend on you twenty four hours a day I mean you just can't stop growing\nIn those respects but people were smaller family especially if they see what what are your family's\nThose kids pick up those values make up the sense of old I'm I'm not the center of the universe there's lots of love and I'm sort of my dad always said he ... we had six he had sex and so if he ... he had sex only children and we all thought we were in the center you know just kind of nice\nYou know so well I honestly I've I've seen this and I think that it looked at the same as marriage where in God's way of forcing us to fly right in other words\nYou know if you're in a marriage and you don't believe in divorce no matter how it goes you say well I'm sticking with it and I'm gonna I'm gonna love this person no matter what even if today I don't feel like it and that does something to us said Shapes Our souls and it it on some level\nForces us to learn how to love and I think that goes you know double for kids when you have these kids you love them so much that when there's trouble or difficulty ah it it just does something to you a ... in a way and again uh not everybody can be blessed with marriage or with kids but I really want to say that when you live in a culture\nWhere you're always hearing about hey you better better take care of yourself and do you know don't don't be a doormat for other people it's like to hear that so much you think your simple wait a second\nUh there's another side to that story you can given given given give and and you just get more and more blessed by God and I think we just don't hear that often enough so uh it's one of the reasons I wanted to have yeah we just got a few seconds left what do we know need to know about this book or Janet before we\nGo yeah I I I'm so glad that you're not promoting and among evangelicals I it's not expensive under twenty dollars I think that um they'll find a lot of interests you and there's a wonderful essay on the structural basis of from the\nChurch's teaching um which I think we're very much resonate with with evangelicals and of course all of them call the second theology the body or an ... directed towards find scriptural\nAmen I'm Sorry we're at a time Janet this guy is called why humanity BTU still right folks you got to educate yourself think about this stuff a lot of great books this is one of them will be right back twenty two year\n\nMy business is at stake because the government told me I Can't live on my faith in the workplace\nI was arrested for handing out the U.S constitution I my college\nState law forcing me to advertise\nTheir taxes are fundamental freedoms are under attack\nThe good news is alliance

Bernstein says I'll I'll share this he says that\nUm he says well you should negotiate with Mexico so that they will participate in paying for this\nBecause they're insecure border is a major cause of the problem right so this would enable the president fulfilled his promise that Mexico would pay for the wall so this is really it's a serious proposal\nUm and he says that ah I don't know if you have it in front of you there but it's just a ... he says that this would be a ... charities and churches in the United states could step up\nTo serve and minister to these people a while you know they they are they are doing this and there's just a lot\nTo it um and he says each of them could apply for US citizenship [noise] uh you know it it's it's it's an opportunity to weed out you know the undesirable the criminals the MS their teens who snuck in ... I mean it's kind of funny because we\nPeople or you know when you watch cable news people in these big arguments and he think wait a minute why if you were a terrorist trying to enter the United states\nWould be the easiest thing in the world would be to join the caravan your uh I mean it's kind of like ridiculous how naive can you be of course it's easy to get into Mexico it's easy to join you know you just flip in if you wanted to cause trouble\nIt's it's just obvious that that that's possible see all these good people by the way these good people you see them on TV they're being used cynically because ... you know what it's like to walk Seventeen hundred\nMiles I I mean these are people with kids are walking to flip flops like the whole thing is is sort of cruel\nBecause they're wandering and wandering and there there's no promise that that that this is going to end well for them I mean but most of these people can't walk that far with kids it's just [noise]\nAnyway I I just I thought I Would I mentioned that some people look at my Facebook page or on Twitter I'm really curious what people think of this proposal my friendship Bernstein ... uh he he basically says that um\n[noise] you know that he's he wants to he wants to know people think this is a good idea he says ah it it it's a it's obviously I'm you know it's just a massive issue but the PR issue and stuff\nRight there is that these folks obviously are being used by bigger you know higher power so let's see this is the thing that\nThere are\nYou know money he'd powers George Soros is probably a behind all this look if you believe what he believes ... and you had billions of dollars\nYou would do what he's doing okay that doesn't make it any less destructive but ... this is only logical to me that he is doing anything he can and it's why I think of him as a as a villain but but it's it's logical and so I think that sometimes you see these images and people get emotional and\nAh anyway I just I I just want to say that uh if you're not getting as good on my Facebook page what am I Twitter feed and you can see this now and this brings up a big thing I have to mention is\nUm I have an
