[noise]\nOver the next segment billions on a minute we'll talk about the questions surrounding the tortillas murder case and whether or not Pamela Smart is indeed the masterminds of this infamous crime all of which has explored\nAnd ... was smart and American murder mystery seen only an investigation discovery again for those of you in trouble is enough to relive this heinous conspiracy feel free to hear all of the evidence is we deliberate\nTo pass most seeking the whole truth and the president I think if we're coming back on board the TV Time machine [noise]\nOh my pleasure thanks for having me Jim\nI'm Diane Tell us about this case and about very special television of it [noise]\nWell ... you may be old enough that maybe not I am I Am that I remembered that my child just shut down there are a number\nOf the year was Nineteen Ninety Pam smart twenty two years old and her newly wed back to their home base in Hampshire and she gets a job working for the public school system she can media liaison person\nI'm her office is right across the street from my high school and one day or a husband and here comes home and admit that she has cheated on her\nHip people working over at the high school on the program and\nWhy would almost sixteen year old boy [laughter] well everything she loves music the same they they just really click his name is it that way when they started pre actual hair\nAnd now I'm going to give you panic version which you hear her say on this show\nI had an affair with him and I knew it was wrong and it was terrible and I'm remorseful but I broke it off I told him I Love my husband was staying with my husband\nAnd what did you do in return he got one of his juvenile delinquent friends and they got a gun and they went to my house when I was at a school board meeting forty miles away and they waited for my husband to come home and when he came home they put a bullet in his head [laughter]\nSo that is the basic story Jim ... and of course as we know Pam was put on trial for being the mastermind of this murder plot prosecution says that she wanted out of the marriage and instead of divorce she convinced this young man and his friends\nTo go and kill her husband so who do you believe it's one of those kinds of stories\nWill on your special you interview panels smart and you know going in did you have an opinion about her ...\nNo I don't I'm I mean as an investigative reporter I I just go in and say okay what is the reality here you know what kind of characters and like dealing with [laughter]\nYou know these these fantastical notorious cases we all make up our minds about who's guilty and who isn't well I go in open minded and I tell me tell me your side of the story Pam\nBecause when you look back you realize\nHer side of the story didn't really get told at that trial\nI I'll tell you one opinion I have I don't think she got a fair trial\nThere was amazingly massive amounts of pretrial publicity the media was all over calling her an ice princess in a black widow and\nHaving Pam smart look alike contest fishing guilty or not and vote on this painting the potential jury pool [noise] I don't think she got a fair trial from the judge didn't he didn't allow their defense to put on witnesses that they wanted and I'd anyway I don't think she got a fair trial but\nI'm open to it or do you do you think she's the type that was capable of convincing a young teenager it was she capable of thinking a young teenager was the right one to turn to to kill her husband\nShe says no absolutely not and you'll see in the interview I did with her at a maximum security prison at Bedford hills New York she's adamant about it I\nI ask are you know they offer you play to get outta here you just to meet you did it she said no I'm not going to admit to something I didn't do I wouldn't do it then and I won't do it now so the result is of course she could be in prison until she dies\nWhile you were talking was or was there anything in particular that she said to cause you to have some doubt about guilt\n[noise] well I'll tell ya what causes me pause on most\nAre the tapes that were recorded way back in Nineteen Ninety Ninety One um they the police wired her young intern a woman named Cecilia peers who you will see on our special [noise]\nThey put a body wire on her and ... capturing conversations where Pam smart says some pretty incriminating things I mean very incriminating things and you'll hear those tapes on this special she says things like um she urges Cecilia to lie to the police\nCars Cecilia is real good friends with Billy and his cohorts\nUm she says if you tell the truth [laughter] you're going to go to jail I'm going to go to jail Billy and Pete and all the boy we're all going to go to jail if you tell the truth ... role that's what gives me pause so I I grill her on that what what are you ... to ... you're you're caught on tape saying this stuff\nThey're grainy hard to hear tapes but I hear you saying this\nAnd her story is that the\nPolice wouldn't give her any information about the investigation on who killed my husband so she turned to Cecilia\nWho always seem to know what's going on with the cops she said I pretended to know about the murder so Cecilia would tell me what she knew about the murder right\nYou you listen to Cecilia you listen to the tapes you listen to Pam and you make up your own mind on that\nCould do either way obviously yeah\nSo I tell you there was one a one witness at trial a great best friend actually who took the stand and said yeah Pam told us she was going to go ahead and call Cecilia and pretend to know about the murder so she could maybe maybe get some information\nWell may be telling that friend that was part of her manipulation or maybe it was just the truth\nYou know that sounds kind of daunting but when you're in the rhythm of it and you're just kind of\nEnding to it going back and forth about your life and then focusing\nBack in on though it's a it's not as complicated as you would think and the reward I mean even if it took a week and a half [laughter] it's it's worth\nNothing these days takes that long I mean that's definitely contrary to a lot of things that people do these days you actually have to take some time and attention to create\nSo now I Know I think that's why I think that was part of the appeal I think it was all of a sudden\nI'd never had a hobby before and now I'm doing something that actually flowing by life down in a way if you can't rush it you have to be patient you have to relax and I think that\nMaking that change in my life kind of made me a a a happier person [laughter] I think now you were so frantic and you're on the effect of your phone and you're constantly feeling you have to do more and the bread doesn't let you do that [laughter] if they have to\nProve for six hours there's no rushing that do you just kind of have to adapt and and that and take your time I think a definitely a big part of the appeal\nTo ... I've always wondered about this what is the science behind creating this hour in server do\nUm the longer that you the longer that you let it for men the more that it can become\nSo you can actually increased the the ... of it and then it becomes like that classic sourdough bread but when I say sourdough bread that's really the process of using a naturally that it's not necessarily will come out like the power to read it you\nHave had in San Francisco it's really just this organic way of using east which is the original way the bread was made you know we didn't have dry\nIn the heat and the old days it was if that were to start or basically though you have this wild east and that was used to make your bread and then started to manipulate it if you will leave it let it go for longer periods of time you can increase the acidity and that was going to give you this hour\nWow that's amazing now some people especially me\nWhen the attempt to bake something quite frequently their efforts fall flat [laughter]\nWhat are some of the key to achieving a successful baking outcome\n[noise] um I think you just have to have to pay attention I mean I'm not really things like that that really mean position I probably would fail off though but\nI find bred to be a little more forgiving it's a little closer in the world to cooking where if you can have a little bit of a you can be a little ... they'll have a a good result but I think you're a\nKnowing that you can't rush it I think I'm is is a huge factor you can kind of hang in there you'll get a good product\nTom it's been a
