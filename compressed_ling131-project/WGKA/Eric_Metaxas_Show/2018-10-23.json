R. M. E. D. to eight seven to to to make sure you get in on that gun did they give away from the U.S DCA arm A. R. M. eighty to eighty seven to two to up to twenty four chances to win your gun daily but you got to act quickly it's over at the end of the month okay make sure to jump on here\nArm a R. M. E. D. to eight seven to two to please do not do that\nWhile you are driving a R. M. U. D. eight seven to two to text it but don't do it while you're driving alright rocket science wow I stayed here sometimes and I just scratch my head Chicago for\nA minute you know we've got issues going in Chicago right now right another three dead seven more shootings\nTo round out another bloody violent weekend in democratic controlled Chicago here's here's my advice to you if you don't want to ... honestly admittedly most of Chicago's violence is gang crime it's black on black black on black crime it's gang related\nAnd the fact of the matter is here's here's the controversial statement from the house if you don't want to be shot in gang related violence don't joined again that someone's going to come out and say well there's a lot of collateral damage there is I understand that\nBut predominantly in the gang violence gang on gang crime so you don't want to be shot dead on a street corner while you were dealing drugs by someone who thinks you're on their Cher and doesn't want you dealing your drugs there\nThen don't do it don't put yourself there\nAgain this is not blaming the victim business called common sense common sense that the progressive left just politically correct media will never tell you\n\nThey'll tell you I'm blaming Mr Lopez for being shot and killed in the store what I'm telling you is Mr Lopez bears some responsibility because he was stealing things that didn't belong to him\nYou know you can't say that the hell I Can't I just did that not blaming the victim that's telling the truth\nUnderstand what I'm telling you understand it as an armed American radio listener\nBut other people need to know this end up getting again I say this\nI said oh gosh a weekly and saying this for years if you attempt to deprive another human being now get this we're going to take this back to Donald Lopez's Lakeland, Florida the Army Navy store if you attempt to deprive another individual of their life liberty and pursuit of happiness\nYou lose all three you lose your right to all three of the above instantly and I don't care what happens to you was Mr Lopez attempting to deprive Mr done of his life liberty pursuit of happiness here's the thing\nMr done is going to try to argue that he was in court yeah he was he was stealing stuff he had a ... it was in his head he picked it up I didn't know if he was going to swing it at me I can promise you right now that was getting ready to go down that the beat dropping their\nThat's what's gonna happen\nAt any good defense attorneys going to take it in that direction what you see on the video is and everything that happened and he's going to be right about that or easy\nWe don't know\nI haven't seen the whole\nThe whole tape shows the individual on the ground bleeding out and dying as a puddle of blood pools up around it\n\nBut any good defense attorney who's going to attempt to do that that's what's getting ready to happen in that courtroom in Polk County\n\nBeatty attempt to deprive Mr done of his life liberty and pursuit of happiness is stealing a hatchet depriving him of his life liberty and pursuit of happiness what I'm telling you as if you find yourself in a situation like that and this is what I Want you to think about\n\nDo you want to pull the trigger I Want you to think if you carry a gun every day\nFor your own personal protection himself defense you better start thinking about these things right now because if you don't you may very well find yourself in a situation like Mr done and you know what it might not be a ... it might be your car\nLet me give you another scenario you got a jumper hops on the side of your car while you're getting gas\nOr maybe you leave to go to the can feel inside the convenience store while the gas is being pumped into your car at the automatic thinks that on the pop right\nYou come outside of your arm you come outside the three individuals happened in your car and driving off\nCan you turn in when fire at those of those individuals in your car no I Know you want to\nI Know you do the answer to that has no you cannot is your vehicle were\nWhat Mr done is going through today this is what I Want you to think about\n\nYou know I always go back to Aaron Hernandez I remember watching the videotape of him coming out of his home after being charged with murder here isn't a ten million dollar twenty five thousand square foot mansion kids in his twenties got his whole life ahead of him he's an idiot\nAnd he's now charged with murder they come and get a T shirt and sweat maybe as breakfast is left on the stove his beautiful girl friend is there is wife whoever she was\nMaybe he's got kids I don't know if he does or not I don't pay that much attention to him but\nThe fact of the matter is the guy gets handcuffed walks out of his house never to see it again never to see it again imagine not coming home ever\n\nAnd going from that environment to a prison cell six by nine\n\nStocked with another individual that you don't want to meet\nLet alone move in with\n\nStuff can happen to you if you make the wrong decision this stuff can happen to you if you're not thinking clearly hey man that guy was feeling that ... for me so I killed him\nThink about what I just said\nImagine the investigative so tell me what happened that do came in my shop ... hatch it from me I tried to stop him okay well good up to that point you got into a fight with a fist fight what fisticuffs\nAnd then I got the best W and he took off was running towards the door and he got away from me he got away from me he was running towards the door so I pulled my got him killed\nThe guy shot him twice and dropped it man\nI'm not losing another hatchet I lost to have just last week I'm sick and tired of losing ...\n\nThis is the kinds of stuff you think about what does that sound does that even sound right no oh and by the way there's a video that shows that\nIt was incredible she is so nice and she brought her husband and listen that guy I Love that guy Paul her husband oh my gosh unbelievable that I got so much to share this is going to be hard you you know what I Do share I Do know yes\nI I gotta okay we get we have to go first of all in this hour I'm Talking to pass your uh Robert Jeffress right ... I'm In an hour or two we had Lee Habib but I I just said I'm dying as you're all weekend long I've been dying to share this with my radio audience\nThe Elton John concert I I don't have any words to even describe what happened it was insane can I can I Try\nPlease please do\nAll right um I uh\nI went to the ... and John concert I was invited by the bass player for open John which itself is lunacy like the bass player Felton John is a wonderful Christian who read my books and he invited me so I just about painted I've shared that on the program I couldn't believe it so I\nI go a with a friend of mine we went to the concert and this this sweet bass player he kind of acts like he's a big nobody is the bass player called John he's such a sweet humble guy Matt Bissonnette he takes us around he introduced us\nThe guys in the band they they'd been in the band since Nineteen Seventy and Seventy one the the um the bass player de Murray passed away years ago but we met the guitarist\nA Davy Jones don't do it as a ledge and you see him you know who he was and then\n... an awesome a drummer since Nineteen Seventy these guys if you watch like old documentary Johnny see these guys they look like you're Eighteen years old now they're like you know older men but it was such a mind blower but it it gets crazier you ready for this are you writing\nGo go\nI don't sound that excited are you okay\nI don't want you want me I'm very excited I'm In New York and I'm In ... no no not I went\nI went to the ... so then uh the the basically says hey let's go to the people aren't maybe we'll see some like be easier right\nAnd I thought yeah that was like what a concept who who's going to be at the John ... like I don't know maybe a bumper to Hillary Clinton no joke she and bill had been there the night before because they were to concerts and Madison Square garden so I dodged the bullet hit with a VIP\nLoud and I look around I don't see anybody then a woman comes up to me and says your air attacks is\nWhen I said uh I'm In the ... and John ... Madison Square garden I don't expect somebody to know who I Am in that world right right she comes up to me she says she loves my books she met my wife in Texas Houston, Texas she's here with her two daughters are watching\nThis has been seen what what is going on [laughter] somebody came up to me and they and they said well we're from Dallas and we're here because our friend Heather talking\nI said what wow she says your friend Heather ... yeah well some people listen to there's no already what I'm about to say right Ernie top and\nIs the man who has written the lyrics to every single Elton John song since the sixties the guy is a legend on par with open John mhm so his wife evidently invited these people and so they bring her over and I meet the wife of burning up I'm about to think because this is really like\nThe two people to know who he is it doesn't get bigger\nRight like wow I'm about the and yeah\nAnd his wife his wife is a Christian and she knows my books and she was all excited to meet me I couldn't I'm dreaming this is like a joke this is somebody spiked my punch she then takes\nUs to meet her husband Bernie top and and I have to tell you if you had told me that I Would need Bernie top and I would never believe you because this guy is just I mean it was\nIt was such an honor and obviously the the concert was was phenomenal but the whole the whole thing was was was just amazing and then I had to race from there like I'm some big shot suddenly had raised from that\nTo Fox News or I got into kind of a rhubarb with Juan Williams\nYeah yeah I saw that a ha you know it was ugly album you saw it I saw it you know he got when he\nGot my backup he said some stuff that I thought wait a second\nThat's ... you can't really believe that one Williams you\nKnow what he said he said he says well he says this president has nothing to run on\nAnd I couldn't even if you despise this president which it's you're right as an American but you can't say he's got nothing to or not that's that is crazy right so I kind of got my backup anyway it was it was just it ... it was nuts and it got even crazier from there because you know\nA ... after that my my book went to the top one hundred that Donald drain the swamp book and so anyway I just\nI I I'm all excited about this and I had had a shared I Am I'm getting at the school\nGirl that wrong\nSo am I I'm a [laughter] a port okay go ahead anyway\nSo I'm In Fresno ... to ... this afternoon or no to night I'm flying back to Los Angeles um I spent time with Victoria Jackson I was I was mentioning it was just the most wonderful time at world outreach a church people are excited\nAbout the Donald drain the swamp book like you never know when you write a book on until you know because it's a kids' book people don't know me as a writer for kids' books are funny stuff but it's a kind of a fable\nFor all ages this is this is my takeaway as I talked to people like they they they're excited because it's a stable that explains\nIt in effect why we should vote for Donald Trump in the midterms like basically it's so simple even child could understand that\nYes yeah I Am and why we have to keep the Republicans in control because it's going to well I mean exactly\nAnd it was even even at Johns mirror that even if you hate your the Republican congressman the problem is you know the the the the pitch is so surreal in the culture right now and in Washington DC that if you don't hold Congress which we probably won't unless everybody everybody\nRight well that was the other one is it well yes go ahead\nWhat one was saying like acting like oh no no it's the person who's a uncivil here and it's like you were saying you are you kidding me you know you witnessed it yourself to see how people were like oh I\n... it's but guess what I'm saying it's like there's this you know they call a gas lighting like somebody like that says something like that you look at them like wait a second I Know for a fact that's not only not true that's crazy talk but it's almost like he has his talking points and he just has to couldn't put it out there\nBut it it actually offended me because I thought that is so not true it's not it's it's beyond the point of view where at a point now where you're playing head games with America that's not right if you're going to disagree disagree on the merits anyway yeah box will probably never have me back oh and I I I just have to say that um\nYou know it was a it was an honor to uh to get to do that and listen you know I Want to forget this before we go to a ... even though I'm all the way\nIn Fresno, California\nWe are still doing a and I'll I'll say this so you don't have to help and but I you're still doing a a fundraiser for the alliance defending freedom and we are I'm embarrassed to say this we're way behind a you know we we kind of when you do something like this you say well we think we could raise this much\n'cause our audience as excited and whatever and\nI obviously overstated wildly and so we're way way behind so if there's anybody inclined to get to the alliance defending freedom\nPlease go to our website you know a website as much taxes talk dot com this is actually so\nImportant maybe part time after pastor Jeffress interview all get into the details on this but this is such an important thing um I I Can't think of anything

I'm\n... I Will be done on earth as it is being done and haven't we pray that so often I Wonder if we've forgotten what we're praying for we're not just praying for some future kingdom of God the gum where say God we want your will to be done now on earth as it is being done in heaven\nI don't think it is God's will for one point four million children to be murdered every year in the womb I don't think it's God's will for\nA Christians to be persecuted and an their heads chopped off around the world I don't think it's God's will have war crosses from war memorials or Ten Commandments displays to be torn down or the name of Jesus being prohibited in the public square\nWe are supposed to be an influence now I just didn't think it was God's will for children to be burned on an open sacrifice to the gods of bail and the ...\nHe didn't think it was right for the people of Israel to be worshipping bail instead of Jehovah so he decided to be an influence in this culture and that's what we talk about it and how you can do that in this chapter\nSlow I Love it because I think that feeling that there's something you can do\nEven if it's a small thing to take a to take seriously the idea that God didn't put you on this earth just do exist\nGetting we had this idea that God's will must be the most the case for most unpleasant thing we could ever think of okay I'm going to surrender and go to Africa and live in the hot\nNow you know why people who are missionaries go to Africa or China or wherever and live as missionaries it because that's what they want to do right they will be miserable doing anything else God uses desires and passions and gifts to give you his direction\nFull that there there's so much in just this now I'm just curious because it's so humorous to me so at age five you said you were on TV and and the TV production bug beat you at age ... that's very funny most five year olds don't even know what TV production is I I just discovered about\nThree years ago myself what the heck production is how is it that first of all you do it on TV at age five\nOh I hate to tell you I was playing my accordion on the Mr ... show the big show we're in\nThe Dallas Fort Worth area can all those are\nKind of a similar a semi regular on the mystery that permit\nTo that is so cute I can scream are you kidding me and\nMy first number words that downtown remember\n... ... yeah yeah yeah\nWell we play that we played on this program all the time I'm not joking that's part of my bumper music blurted\nDimension up up in the way that was the very first concert I ever went to in high school here in Dallas uh a memorial auditorium the fifth dimension\nKnock memories you are not kidding I Love it I Love and also the idea of you I mean 'cause most people obviously they've seen it on Fox News whatever the idea of you as a cute as a bug five year old playing your accordion Mr ferman show is there is that available on YouTube best the cutest thing I've ever tried to\nKill or trying to find and destroy all copies that may be and exist\nThat is so cute I cannot even believe that at age five you were doing that that's restive and what what's the song you played\nA downtown ...\n[laughter] it's so cute I cannot get over it that is incredible I I Want to see this but so you were your your parents obviously pushed you to do this or or or it allowed you to do this and you you did it and you're telling me that oh did you do more TV after that it was that it\nYeah yeah I did I did why did that kind of you know growing up and then actually my ... and uh make my money go into high school and college doing weddings and bar mitzvah was and everything else we could have played in some places I probably shouldn't have played a and you\nKnow yeah I can I can play Darryl Darryl poke and make tears come down\nYour [laughter] well I Know the accordingly huge in the sixties and and a lot of kids play the accordion it's not ... you don't\nSee too many kids in that today what you're telling me you were on the Mr peppermint show I we didn't have that where I grew up so I'm just I'm kind of Jell O clock they sound so cute but so you something about that\nKind of got into you and what I find interesting too when you talk about the way God makes people you didn't think oh I Want to be on TV you thought I don't want to be a TV producer ... that's just an amazing thing for a little kid to be thinking about that\nAnd and you know again the idea of broadcast you're not very important part of our ministry in the way we reached people and the business aspect you know it's hard to be a pastor without having some\nA business training and business ... and our particular situation here in Dallas First Baptist Dallas I mean you know we just did a hundred and thirty five million dollar Newt campus and it's very complex a financial operation and again I think God put that interest and those are made because he knew what he was preparing me for\nThat key as God is doing that in every Christian fly he's given those unique interest and passions and gifted that's to fulfill his eternal purpose\nI limit on TALK before we go I just wanted to see real quick how do we how was it the gods spoke to you when you were Fifteen about being a preacher I'm just fascinated with this you know I\nCan point to that was the second friday June Nineteen Seventy one at eleven fifty five AM in the morning\nNow people say what was it an audible voice I say no it was louder than that but it was an unmistakable call a God that I was going to be a pastor and there came that moment when I say OK or yes that is what I'm going to do\nThat comes for everybody wants to have that extraordinary live we have to say yes work\nWell I just love it a folks the book is choosing the extraordinary life God's seven secrets for success and significance and my final question we just got ... seconds or left where were you when that happened but it's always curious when people say God spoke to me were you in church where you at home\nI was actually a youth camp but not singing around the campfire combined yawn holding hands and all of that it was actually the moon's surface the preacher had been up preaching I wasn't listening to a thing you would say\nReally God was speaking to me and they sounded the bell for the service to be over and everybody to run to get in line and the lunch line and everybody's running past me as I was walking between that old Tabernacle where we met and the launch a area I mean is I was walking God spoke to me\nVery clearly I don't do that

Eighteen Seventy one and people shore to know that it was a cow and a lot of theories about what started the fire\nReally started the fire era which at Chicago had grown from a little town of about you know three thousand Thirty years to count of three hundred thousand because trains said started\nThe the the the manufacturing in America started and it was suddenly moving to Chicago and they moved in so fast that such volume and they built all these buildings with building codes whatsoever and they were all built out of wood that on one particular arid October day\nWhere when these holes were filled with ... ... to create fire ending winter for no which just destined to happen that third one thirty one third of the city to the ground over there were a hundred thousand homeless Chicagoans the banks are all burned to the ground the retailers will er into the ground\nAnd yet the story of the Chicago recovery was what I had to write about because it only a few years the city was built and there was no Illinois emergency management and there was no federal emergency management and almost nobody had insurance so for me the story was how they act\nIn Chicago do it in the day when there was no one to turn to with fellow Chicago\nWell first of all you know when you talk about a fire the great fire in Chicago it it's hard for us to believe in this day and age how fires devastated major cities I mean this was a normal thing practically I mean New York was devastated a number of times I mean the great\nA Chicago fire courses are really the most famous but a ... it is

wonderful things about Chicago but it is really struggling right now I mean there's a tremendous irony there and it's very sad\nIt is that it got captured by the public employee pension unions right so that debt which no one can repay has nothing to do with the American critics character it has to do with rewriting graft\nAnd extortion right and so what what got lost over time and what mobsters always do whether they work for the government will for the mob is they're always looking\nTo particularly big cities where they can capture free rent right and they can capture it through unions to public employee pension your news my goodness this is Chicago's problem and one day a week you able to pay the bills it's also New Jersey's problem it's\nAlso California's problem and the joy of the
