S. could pull the mayor of tombstone do hereby proclaimed that from this day forward tombstone she'll be known as America's Second Amendment city in full support of the declaration of independence\nAnd the constitution of the United states approved this tenth day of January two thousand seven in\nThe ... dusted actually pulled them era when he was sitting here made a comment that I've got to ask you about I didn't he didn't have enough time because I knew the response will be a little bit longer than he had he mentioned that all went away back in Nineteen Seventy ... there's talk\nAbout that was actually down by the ... seventies right but you can carry it got anywhere in town now question for you there used to be some businesses in town and I won't name them although I Know who they are it used to be you could check your firearm in this town at the\nHat shop across the street from a couple of places if you wanted to carry a gun in certain places and I have done that before and I think it cost me like six bucks and I got to be honest with you I thought it was kind of cool that I was checking my guns in tombstone\nThe only thing on cool about that is having to check your guns in tombstone you see right there how both of those can you can you can say once cool ones not but it's cool but it's not as cool that's cool but it's not really cool but it's cool but it's not\nDo those businesses now has there been a change since this proclamation that businesses allow UN with guns if it's legal in the state of Arizona am I making that did you is that question to the clout right\nYeah that's fine or the most of the best 'cause I think all the businesses and to support our Second Amendment and this proclamation um there's some of them to still allow that\nUm but I think the ones with liquor are that's an issue so they don't allow guns in an environment serves liquor like a bar of course\nIs that Arizona law that you can't have a gun and an establishment that serves liquor or is that their choice they just don't want it in there or can you go in with a gun and not drink liquor because there's a distinction there\nI Believe it's the the the establishment choice and um but you know guns in alcohol don't always mix I think anyone would agree with that\nYeah and it's interesting and the reason I asked that is because I have contacted a couple of establishment here in town\nYeah again I won't name names or the ... all great established insolvent fantastic and ask because I was unaware and I'm going back a few years am I allowed to carry my gun in your establishment and the response was under Arizona law you can and if you really want to you okay but we would prefer not\nAnd you know I honored their honor their preference so I I I think it's interesting because I Know every single one of them that I spoke to said we support the second amendment and they do support the second amendment I Know they do but I just was curious if this proclamation\nChanged anything in town did anybody in town fight you want it did anybody say\nHey we don't want this or guns or bad I mean those people are out there did we did you get any pushback to\nLiterally out of a of a whole city town and uh\nIt did support people that support the proclamation and they did support our constitution and and I write in our individual rights yeah\nYeah because there's some there's one interesting politics in the town of to have done and I'm curious what did anybody push back hard did what did you get any particular level like you would in a you know in a place like Phoenix or where you know you've got groups that would actually come out and and actually pick you or fight you you didn't get any of that\nNothing nothing no demonstrators just just you know one person maybe wasn't happy with that but the everyone else was a it was very positive\nGood it is positive thing I Love it now let's talk about some big names you got some big plans and I love the fact you said you like to think really big\n...

something happened to the party\nThat it it has just made such a harsh left turn\nThat it's a it's actually frightening they're the party that is against genuine religious liberty in America which is an astounding thing I mean that they used to be the ACLU used to stand up for religious liberty there's a lot of scary stuff happening in and if you don't take action by at least voting\nA and arming yourself with the facts on this stuff you know a ... when things go south of ... you're going to ask yourself to blame we don't want that speaking of which were doing a campaign with the alliance defending freedom now these folks they are the premiere organization fighting on behalf of religious freedom\nAcross America and not only are they fighting they're winning for many years lengths defending freedom a has\nBeen winning really important battles and when they fight they're not fighting for themselves or for me there fighting for all of us even if you disagree with them you're the benefactor so here's here's a clip a Jim Campbell he's a senior counsel lawyer at the alliance offending freedom here is\nA it was started by people like James Dobson and Marlin medics and it was really just a response as these gentlemen and others like them looked out and saw there were a lot of challenges to religious freedom and they didn't see anyone out there to defend it so they said we're going to address this problem by putting together this new organization\nIt's over the last twenty five years we've been defending religious freedom and defending freedom of speech around the country well there you have\nThe country and around the corner of frankly if you are your neighbors face challenges tea or religious rights which you will inevitably in these crazy times we have to

know you\nYou you can't you can't do that you have to try to understand what is the scriptures teach and so of course we are supposed to be welcoming but it doesn't mean that we're supposed to change or national policies and so Soros 'em and Jim Wallace and others have very\nUh cynically in some cases in source case it is totally cynically and Wallace his case ah I think it might be well meaning late but ignorant Lee has has twisted the scriptures and people have swallowed it I have many dear friends that have swallowed this stuff\nAnd and they've decided that you know they need to vote for Elizabeth Warren or they need to vote for him or he know or they need to vote for for Chuck Schumer whoever is out there that sounds compassionate\nBut in fact their policies are brutal they're not

these people sounding compassionate sounding biblical but they're not I mean they're just not\nIn by the way it's very important for folks cannot do speculation but this is a lot of it is public information on what's called the IRS nine Ninety forms of\nThe open society foundation and other progressive foundations regrets it liberal foundations like a tight foundation New America foundation national immigration form anybody can dive into that's got to guide star dot com and look for higher at nine Ninety than\nAnd follow the money and it explains the rapid eye it explains gets and and black lives matter and then ... and the women's march to recruit new voters and new candidates explains the weapon I think that the me too movement against men\nSaid that all of those recruited women could take their places in elected office says it explains what happened to judge Kavanaugh\nAt the last few weeks a this is not this is a growth industry and the reason and Artie and it's actually very dangerous\nWe uh and fortunately Laura Ingraham and and I'm a shell now and and even a\nWall Street journal a liberal reporter has been reporting on that so we're certainly not alone\nBut the he said even local groups so called they're not actually\nI'm very dangerous and can intentionally confusing if they'd like scrape take the way he painted and in fact Eric right now there are ministers on buses all across America called ... the common good that they're they reclaiming geez that meant\nA and that is essentially trying to reclaim power\nA by breaking up the the natural tendency Christians to vote for a\nPlatform of of life and freedom as\nWell as the giants so cynical but his young people are so impressionable and they have good hearts and I mean I noticed this happened with my book on William Wilbur force write I write about will before ... the slave trade\nUh in my book amazing gray up and I got a phone call from governor John Case that great and he was all excited about it and I was so honored that this governor is reading about Wilbur force but what I realize is that he\nAnd others they kind of took it in the wrong direction and others at all became about\nSocial justice let me tell you something William Wilbur force was not about social justice the way we see it today and sometimes people who have good hearts\nA and so this is why Soros dire and these guys are trying to break up the evangelical wise um tendency to them to vote for the party that Republican platform try\nNot to be on a President Trump ... it's the future of the country but that we're talking about and so the reason for us and others Obama even what funding through the state department or some faith groups\nTo see the mass migration was that it was quickly connected to of ... ... voter registration right and so this is about power and period and a sadly open society foundation is at twenty five billion dollar foundation funding all this\nA lot of the stuff around the world America is one of dozens of countries that he's undermining and demoralizing so we need to wake up to what he said the ... and we need to vote and we need to bring our white friends with us\nIt's it's really amazing I you know I speak all around the country and and I often say that if you were ever tempted not to vote or to say politics is not for me that Christian politics don't mix that is bad\nTheology has bad it's not biblical if the Bible said that\nI'd be screaming about it on this program because it's important to do with the Bible says but the Bible doesn't say that people since the beginning of time at miss understood scripture so it's really important that you take the responsibility to understand what it says and does and doesn't say and I really think that a lot of sweet young people have been swayed and pulled\nLeft towards you know hashtags social justice because they missed understand what it says of course we're supposed to be compassionate but the question is how\nAnd I I have to say with Kanye West or you know appearing to praise this president for his policies a lot of young people are thinking you know what maybe we have been getting it wrong maybe Donald Trump's policies are compassionate\nMay be the policies of the people who talk about compassion are not compassionate and I really think we have to think for ourselves you can't just when somebody says that we believe in compassion we believe in helping the poor doesn't mean they're doing it and this is the thing is that if you want to destroy your future and if you don't want to help the poor and then you float along with the socialist\nTied but the fact that evangelicals are being very cynically drawn into this uh it's just so good to have you wound up to wake people up to understand that a huge effort has been made it's been going on since the Obama administration and before two thousand and eight in two thousand twelve\nOr I mean you know that for a fact don't you\nDo and I think it's time for all Americans to\nLook past words like progress that actually regrets and compassion let's not come patch and we have to Jesus said you know that for you know that treat by the fruit\nAnd so American evangelicals dot com we make tried to make the case that biblical truth is the highest love for human beings and for cultures it's on a lot of things to pay the ... the global at social engineers people suffer\nAnd you know open borders are less loving than wise welcome socialism is less loving than human creativity made in God that God damage can sexuality is less loving than cabinet marriage\nOut where ... with with without covenant marriage we the break out of poverty and polygamy and disease and loneliness children not protected from abuse and traffic ... what's happening in marriage that with the progress that with the greater luck\nA solid its eagle could break up families as the building blocks of flourishing cultures and so American even look we
