{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "And you're suggesting very clearly that a veteran suing to receive better medical care from would be a facility than from private facility just because they understand who he she use and how to treat them as a whole person not just as a person with a particular physical issues are dealing with is the moment so I kept you right\nYes and also that matter and then the a ... homeless programs I mean the me really deliver is what the private sector can't and it's not designed to deliver which is really kind of hold out and that doesn't just mean treating your diabetes or treating your chance to get in\nHelping you with work was helping you on campus readjusting to civilian life after you come back from Iraq the or a campus veterans center they set up it means homeless programs I mean I spent days\nScouring the streets will be a social worker working for homeless veterans I've gotten really good at figuring out which Eli people sleeping and which alley they always say when and how many health care system are going out there looking for homeless veterans\nVA help veterans with legal problems which veterans outreach programs I it's sunny I Wish I were a veteran 'cause I'm never going to get the kind of care that veterans bad and I have like the best health insurance there is it because it's just not available and what we need to do is protect that\nI personally think every veteran regard because as you know so wow eligibility is limited to veterans service connected disability and or are poor and I personally think or twenty million veterans\nShould be allowed into the VA and I don't think it would cost that much more because most of those veterans who would be added are healthier and wealthier and so they're healthier\nAnd instead what we're now doing his outsourcing more care between two dozen fourteen and she's had Seventeen\nThe budget for outsource carrying the private sector private sector that studies show doesn't know how to take care of veterans has increased by forty nine percent and the a budget has increased by nine cents\nI mean that ain't going to get you more staff less burnout better care that's gonna get worse care and increase the calls her privatization and I think that you know for veterans that would be disastrous\nI understand what you're saying and I do not disagree\nHowever I think that a substantial portion of that outsourcing hassle to people that are too far away from a facility to get timely care I personally see there's a benefit to allowing somebody because they are hundred or more miles away from show to go into somebody more local\nBut that doesn't change the fact that the VA isn't understand you better which is why I think veterans given a choice would rather go to a VA facility because they are going to do with people who understand their situation\nAbsolutely and I think the one thing I worry about is that where there are problems with veteran is getting to care\nUsually it's rural areas and they're unfortunately aren't necessarily private facilities wedding and take them I mean in America\nAnd the next ten years working in the seven hundred row on hospitals clothes in the past few years eighty two of clothes so there aren't necessarily places for people to go I mean fifty five percent of American counties all of them are all had no psychiatry psychologist or a social worker\nNow the d._a. can help with that because it has tele medicine and it can tell them medicine is actually it's one of the leaders globally and tell medicine\nSo I think yes absolutely if somebody can't get access to care the VA always done that let people go into the community but what I worry about is that there's really a huge influx of veterans if you keep sending more and more veterans\nOut to private sector care you're going to overwhelm an already stretched private sector system particularly primary in mental health care and I don't necessarily think and I can veterans may not get good care and I'm thinking a lot of cases the carrots in the air for them to get so\nI don't think this has been well thought out I don't think a lot of people in Congress that sadly even many of the physicians who tend to be medical specialists under scanned health care and the broad needs of veterans and the port of problems and our other health care system\nI think you are right this is going to go on from lots of freedom we're discussing our vi healthcare system which was Gordon Suzanne let's wrap up a little bit what she points would you like our listeners will take away from our conversation what key issues would you like to remember\nYes there are problems with the Wii ha but there's also a lot of great things and let's keep a balance you here\nI think that people need to really contact their Congress people about the mission act about some of the things that are going on I have no idea what's going to happen after the election who's going to be there but I think people need to stop\nBashing that VA I mean you don't solve a problem by hammering if he's going to solve a problem by constructively on ... and\nI think the blame chain game is really not a good idea\nI think also that you know people have to be active and they have to recognize that this is actually a national treasure invested Seventy years worth of\nBillions and billions of dollars and you don't improve something by tearing it down you could buy strengthening it and giving it the funding and staffing needs and addressing the problems which are actually\nOften about micro management central is Asian and so forth and that that's not to get solved by privatizing the system\nAnd I just really think that we always thank veterans for their service I then really on by the people who work at the da to serve veterans third of them are veterans and I think we need to protect them and thanked them for their service they could be working\nSomewhere else and earning a whole lot more because of the actually isn't allowed to offer market rate salaries which by the way it should change\nSo we need to really value veterans five value is\nHealth care system that's designed to deal with the they're very specific problems which are very specific\nWill put by the way your book wounds of war I think is one every veteran probably every citizen should own how can the copies like Amazon and places like that\nWell they can get it from Amazon and they can get it from their local bookstore I Love the independent bookstores if you go into your independent bookstore\nAnd if they don't have that you can order it you can get a notice on you can get it on India dot com from Cornell University press which is the publisher you can check out my website Suzanne Gordon dot com\nAnd I hope people will read it\nComes from we're also going to give away a copy of wounds of war at the end of the show so stick around and take a shot at that too but I recommend you go to Suzanne thank you very much for joining us today thank you for your efforts to help us all understand that support or veterans' health care system I really appreciate you\nThank you and I appreciate you having me on\nNow it's time for our sample report this is when we find it I was there any performance in you know we all get along with is flying through\nWell this one's a military dependent instead of just gathering his favorite toys before fleeing the wildfire with his family eleven year old Gavin Zeke do something as simple but extraordinary during a mandatory evacuation or Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton the summer he helped us neighbors\n... pounds on the experience of series of wildfires because of the proximity to fire the bass issued a mandatory evacuation\nQuote I remember being chaotic we have several residents who didn't know where to go or what to do so John Lopez who is the maintenance manager of the housing group\nDuring an evacuation of this nature most would cling to their family members pets are a few precious possession for gathering however alerted his neighbors to the danger opposing their housing community was his only priority\nQuote I was a vacuum and a lot of residents during the fire and it was said to me by several residents the young man was knocking on doors and helping scrap children in their seats of Lopez\nWhile he was shaking scared he was still helping his friends and their families make it safe\nLopez's across the street from Kevin in his family and witnessed him running around the neighborhood knocking on his neighbors' doors and loaded up his family's car as well as the safety of his neighbors are gathering their belongings so they can be evacuated safely gambling suffers options July six demonstrated that he was willing to put his own fears aside to help in a time of crisis\nAs a result he was presented a certificate or appreciation from the capital the fire department on October ...\nQuote this day and age we can't expect teenagers and young kids to preserve life because as parents we feel it's our job says Lopez I was amazed at the fact that he took charge and decided to help people and save lives you can't put it into words\nDevin proved to be an amazing young man and I feel blessed to know he made this positive impact or was it goes without being said there's a local hero to stand tall\nEvans Zeke front lines of freedom and all of our nation's patriots salute you conclude the first hour the show we'll start the second hour discussing war

course we're ... or we can a mailbag military history at around America report which I welcome your comments or questions contact me for much for the doctor now it's time to discuss the\nUnsung heroes of World War two war animals we'll talk with author Robin Hood in case you thought only dogs were war animals like idea you're about to find out you are wrong like I was welcome different ones of freedom Robin\nAny thank you so much for having me I'm very excited to be here\nOr loved the book Robin share some of your background from where did your love of animals and your research come from\nGuy go up with dogs and everything as a kid we had to always seem to have one so I got a love of animals my whole life and horses I rarely also loved never owned a horse horses always carried a special place in my heart\nAnd to find these wonderful animals it has just been a fabulous fabulous journey my first book was on Sargent rackleff\nBut great Korean War horse that served at the marine corps and the Korea when I discovered her story and did her book I was actually able to get a medal for reckless called the ticking metal\nTurns out that they tore across for animals it's the greatest metal an animal can receive for a gallon trained bravery and so when I was discovering and doing the history and everything of that matter I discovered all of these\nPhenomena animals that received the medal in World War two\nAnd I just fell in love with their story I really just hunker down and there's over Seventy animals in the book and to get their histories and stories and everything it was really quite fascinating animal wonderful journey for me to\nLearn so much great job that I edited forgotten or never knew about from World war two\nWell is this amazing you don't know what you don't know\n[laughter]\nThat's so true and you know what this down to me were truly was not only were the lord birds the Hitchens so her ... there's no way to account for the number of lives these animals said let her out but I guarantee you and I'm sure you can attest any he'll never think of a tension as a rat with wings again\nAmateur writing a book [laughter] from what\nI what I found that ... with World War two was that we didn't have a warrant dog program at that time and so people actually donated their personal pet to the war cause after Pearl Harbor was bombed\nAnd that just done to me I they're better patriots than I because we skip World War two and go right to World War three if you dare try to take my mistake of war [laughter]\nIt's just truly blew me away to see the patriotism and the people just stepping up to the plate donating their dogs to the cause and it was just an amazing piece of history just as a truly unique time\nWill you're pointing out so we didn't have anything like that was as World War two start we should have coming out of the ... but it was incredible because that's the story in itself how our nation military suddenly realize their new dogs would have been deploying\nAbsolutely absolutely and then when you think that a poodle breed are named Arlene Earl anger\nWho was very big in the dog world with the Westminster dog show and American kennel club and everything she got together after Pearl Harbor together with her friends and said the dogs need to be a part of this and they started dogs for defense and dogs for defense\nDid the national cry for people to donate their pets and they set up with the army they had to convince the army but this was a good idea\nAnd so they trained dogs that started standing at different ammunitions plants and airports and factories because they were afraid of sabotage after Pearl Harbor was bombed you know and and guarding the coastline and stuff\nAnd so they recruited forty thousand dogs were donated now not all of them made the cut of course you know somewhere to old some are not the right breed some might have been sickly or\nDidn't have the right temperament twenty thousand they all went through the initial training and ... over ten thousand four hundred actually served\nIn either the army or the coast guard a guarding our coastlines and everything and then the marine corps had their own award dog program with a Doberman Pincher club they teamed up with a Doberman Pincher club\nThat they too got German shepherds and Belgian shepherds to act as messenger dogs and stuff and the Pacific and it's just a fascinating piece of history it really truly is\nBecause you do this is going to get along for freedom we're discussing Warren animals with author Robin ... well Robyn we're talking dogs but there's at least a cat and some pictures of your check the rest of the story\nYes absolutely well the pensions they of course we're the carrier pigeon they would be taken on air there would be at least one to two\nCarrier pigeon homing pigeons on the airplanes that the bombers and everything these birds were amazing they would be dropped from planes they would be dropped behind enemy lines hoping that somebody in the French Resistance would find them\nAnd you know answer some questions and then release the bird to fly back with information about how the war was going are very most famous bird was a bird named GI Joe\nAnd GI Joe is the only animal back in World War two only American animal that received their Beck and metal Victoria Cross for animals and what GI Joe did was he flew twenty miles and twenty minutes and stop the planes taking off on the tarmac\nThe British were trying to take over this town called Colby Vecchia in Italy but the Germans had occupied and they were having a tough time so bombing mission had been set up\nBut the Germans gave up the town about ten thirty in the morning and the bombing mission will set for eleven ten well the Brits had no communication back to headquarters to tell them that they indeed had taken over the town stop and then this yet\nSo all they had was GI Joe and they strap a message on GI Joes leg and released him and thankfully he got through and time twenty miles and twenty minutes and stop the plane and it saved over a hundred British soldiers live that had just taken over the town\nAnd so you know there is amazing stories like that was so many different bird being and planes that crashed in the ocean and being able to get their messages back to tell the headquarters where the plane had gone down our\nNews from Normandy you know uh the Duke of Normandy was the first bird\nBack from the frontlines of Normandy back to Great Britain to a report on how well the attack went to and the landing lists and so many great stories of how these birds would be shot and have their lead dangling and still make it through the mission to get the message is through and\nThey were shot at that had snipers trained for them they had to dodge falcons that we're trying to attack them\nAnd still had to fly through the battle you know just the the mortars and battles and stuff and it was phenomenal how they were able to persevere and over thirty two of them received this prestigious metal back in World War two\nTo most of us don't realize how by our standards to the primitive communication was back then we were ... his radar that's right radios wouldn't go that far they weren't satellite or the work that you just to maintain\nAnd act like this was a ... form of communication which yeah all kinds of lives so amazing is under state yeah\nYeah it truly is and that you know and the jungles of bogus Advil and the Pacific islands walkie talkie that they had wouldn't work than any other lines of communication that'd be cut by the Japanese and so they had messenger dogs that's the only way that they could get a lot of times the message through is using these dogs\nTo take a message back from the front line back to the combat headquarters\nRobin how can listeners get a copy of war animals I presume it's available on line Amazon solitaire is\nThey can go to Amazon Barnes and noble books the million wherever books are sold you can get it\nAlso have if you go to my website more animals dot com you will see more information and some wonderful pictures

you want to be victims either\nSo that's something that is transferable to the civilian world\nThough not in the aggressive sense right\nYeah I think it's important for civilians to recognize the level of commitment and the level in the intensity and sometimes violence that the military has\nBut they need to also understand that we are just people just like they are we're not different kinds of people we're just dedicated ourselves to a life of protecting the country and to do that you have to be willing not only to sacrifice physically but also to be prepared to be very violent\nAnd that takes a toll on people you see all the pie TST coming back from the latest wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and\nI think there are people in our society that things that we love the violence and we're out there just to kill people and stuff that is the farthest thing from the truth I mean we come back damage from what we have to go through and what we have to do and I think it's so important to realize that war especially close combat takes a toll on everyone that's involved we talked about the difference between men and women last week\nI think one of the key things about men for better or for worse is that we were able to sort of compartmentalize things yes and in the middle of a battle your buddy gets shot you do not have time degree not even a second you know the guy that picked him off got his crosshairs right on you so what are you going to do to get out of this mission and make things right\nAnd you know it might be weeks or even months later for that comes back into your mind and all of a sudden you find yourself greeting so there's there's an intense emotional toll that it takes on a person to be in combat but that's whole has got to be later it can't be in a moment\nAnd that's all part of the nature of the warrior right there is a lot more to discuss about this and folks on because they haven't met back on regularly as we pursue the definition of the idea of a

intelligence folks what would be the first enemy unit we would face your door start\nIt took a while they got back to me with the guest is the first unit would beat would be something like a hundred

unprovoked violence is happening more and more these days and I suspect it will get worse before it gets better it all started in Europe about ten years ago and it was called the happy slapping game

them and sucker punch them in the face\nThe goal was to render them unconscious with one punch in some cases they wouldn't even kick the unconscious victim as they lay on the sidewalk and even take
