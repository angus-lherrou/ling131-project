side swipe to no visible on YouTube Premium Hurley told us what side swipe is all about\nI think that it's a comedy I Need to get that that that that it's tackling dating and the digital era and then it's going to do it relationship but romantic and ... because you know my mom and I read that our cat is also dating um she's in her fifties and widowed\nI'm living with my character and just starting her life over for the first time and killing on a dating app and then you have my younger sister again who are twenty and she's the millennial\nI'm kind of living by today's world you know she got married before thirty has a kid but it now sort of feeling like that seven year itch and her marriage and getting a little bit bored wondering if she made the right decisions and is letting vicariously to our character that we're having fun\nSo tell us about your character Olivia what kind of person who she\nShe uptight and the beginning she works in insurance is doing really well\nI'm without a relationship for the last few years she had a five year one that you know after she got out she just went over to her work and didn't date and had done really well and so now she's starting pitcher talks are into getting on tinder after she goes to the gynecologist who's played by taking today can where he tells her that\nAt thirty five basically you're starting to dry out and if they ever want to have kids or anything you better you know like ... it kinda got to get started on dating um which is a lot I think that women here in our thirties and there are there are there on tender and um she decides today I'll let her ... and you'll see her kind of start opening up there\nAnd becoming a different person away all of them have big ark\nWell she has two hundred and fifty two matches so yeah since a live you do is kind of doing the ultimate in speed dating or are you assume that not every day there's a home run is is that the case\nAnd also she's not always the home run you know what I mean like I feel like that's a big part of dating is\nIowa is the ... you know that like drink too much or I was the one that was ruining the date sometimes it right and the first episode you'll see that she's the one that the ...\nUm and it's not a data that we shall we say it's not like you'll see a different data every week and then you know we're going to go on to win or if you ever really not that it just a jumping off point of the show but the show is really a grounded about life more than it is about to tender dating and his relationship between the mom and sister\nAnd I think a lot of people will find relate a ball and a lot of it at my own it\nStrangers in life whether it be with dating or just embarrassing things like the gynecologist office that seen happen to me I'm so you'll see a lot of that stuff about to life where it's kind of cringe worthy comedy sometimes [laughter] but I Love to watch\nSo when do you think that many matches with Olivia learned about human beings and what does she perhaps lose them so\nYeah I mean that's that that's really the message is is\nYou know she's not at the end of the day she's not out looking for\nMr Right to save the day and come in and you know live happily ever after I'd like to get the message across that you know you're going to even experience all these things in life but really most important thing is she's figuring out who she is and what she loves that if somebody gets into that part you know naturally than great\nBut it's these three women kind of figuring out who they are at the later stages in life\nUm and and how important that is\nThat how much it affect you if you bring somebody in and get married and make that everything to you what happened like right on and when her husband dies she's left with nothing you know she had no skills you've never had a job and she has to come up with my character\nAnd I and so a big part of it is just you know as women I think we're we're taught as kids like the princess is live happily ever after and you find your prints and all that stuff and it's just it's so much more about know figure out who you are you know do your thing figure out what makes you happy and if somebody fit into that great\nYou mentioned the ... mom Mary she's old dating yeah\nPlay by rather than our cat who is amazing\nThe fact that the now she was something in common is that India is that an hints or relationship that they become closer his mother and daughter\nIn certain ways that died in certain ways that it it you know a makes it worse because of your mom and dating and she's living with her and her she's a little bit like a teenager you know what I mean she's like I said you've never had a jobs they're going to see her\nGet a job for a first time like figure out what it's like to be independent and Olivia their roles were reversed for a living is more like the mom and she's like the kid do and how that affects Olivia when she really just\nNeeds a mom you know ... and that sort of based on like when my mom was single in her fifties they're very different my mom's very independent but the idea that um\nThat that when you're when she's doing that and they kind of become your friend as opposed to your mom and how that affects the relationship I always found that really interesting and I bring that into their relationship\nTo you mentioned rows and rows of course is is your ... was it like working with her\nIt was really fun I mean she's a proud she's been doing this forever and she's so good\nAnd honestly was perfect for the role like as soon as her name was brought up everybody we were just trying to think who would who would be good for this role you know somebody in their fifties that embodied all of these characteristics are going to be always play them and she was she was dead on and when we met her\nShe just was game to do anything so that was awesome and and had her own ideas I wanted to bring menopause into this world you know what I mean like what it's like to be going through menopause and got you on that really funny it interesting and sad\nI'm so she was great I mean the fact that he was gay to do everything it's a very vulnerable role that I think a lot of actresses would have trouble playing that she took on and did have challenges but but handled them really well and I think now that in the end\nRight now you mentioned that size what is the least partially autobiographical so how much of a Libya is truly you\n[noise] you know it's it's it's based on parts of me you know
