his book is number one on Amazon yesterday and I thought aren't there enough like Trump who could make my book\nDo better than his book I mean honestly it's crazy 'cause his books not even a kids' book my book I'm hoping that people actually buy for for their kids and for adults it's like one of those I mean it's it's it's a kids' book that works for everybody at first I just thought of as a humor book for adults but of course it works for kids right\nSo the weird thing though is that his book you wouldn't give it to a kid because it's just snarky adult humor it's not meant for for kids is not innocent and sweet it's kind of mean so anyway so if you uh by Donald drain the swamp you'll you'll helped me\nA take take Stephen Colbert down a notch you know 'cause he's got a he's got to be

they want to make him king and like George Washington he says you don't want to change your free people now you don't need a king\nYou need you need a leader who who listen to you right you're not going to listen to the leader like ... or a dictator some bureaucracy you're going to tell you a leader what to do in the leaders got to do it and they said you mean like a president he 'cause yeah and if that's what you're looking for um your caveman so we've pretty you know these are these stickers in these buttons that say he's my caveman\nAnd they're kind of red white and blue they're big they're like over three inches in diameter and the only way to get them at this point\nIs to buy if you buy five copies of the book and send us a ... purchase now the book is like Thirteen dollars on

cherry earn hit my nose\nOr you are your nose again man ... you you'd be sure you have that\nCar rise well anyway I Want to say that this is really exciting for me because these buttons are very much

and this was a seven to decision meaning that the Supreme Court\nIs not you know divided always divided or ideological here politically whatever seven of the nine Supreme Court justice and said the jak Philips has a constitutional rights had been violated\nSo this is where we are as a country is that even though seven of the two Supreme Court justices\nAgreed the Jack was wronged\nYou still have to fight these legal battles it still has to be argued an argument argued 'til you can get it to the Supreme Court and by the grace of God they ruled correctly but it's an amazing thing most Americans think that well if it's right or wrong it will be figured out right away no the state of Colorado gets this totally wrong you guys have to argue at all the way the Supreme Court what would that

um ... what\nIt means to be an American and how precious it is and so what we're describing your religious liberty in the history of the world nobody's ever had religious liberty is the rarest thing are really never had an a nation to Seventeen Seventy six and by the way uh\nWe've had so much of it than most people don't even know what it is and so I Do think that one of the reasons I Want to have a both of you want us to to help people understand what is at stake this is not something it just happens in the newspapers this is real people\nFighting um the thank you for um\nWherever and seeing my book or a Jack and I I uh but I Want to say right back at you or you become a hero to so many people because\nTo have to go through what you've been through um you did not pick this as we just said you did not pick this and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom who knows we don't really want to think where you'd be right now um but it's terrible people's lives are being ruined\nA and we have to stand up and fight so now is Matt let me ask you you said that you're you're taking this is it are you arguing in front of the civil rights commission first is that what you just said\nYeah so that's happening parallel at the same time that we're actually trying to get\nAll the civil rights commission it's hearing a it's biased proceedings dismissed and so we're actually asking a federal court to step in and put an end to all of this um so that jak doesn't have to be dragged through the same six year process again and that he can go back to doing what he loves\nOkay and and the ... which federal court is it can you say\nYeah so we're in a federal district court of Colorado and so kind of the the normal process you know will argue there hopefully get a victory but it's not it will go up to the court of appeals and potentially back to the U.S Supreme Court but we're hoping that\nUh we don't have to go that far that we can get a resounding victory and and put an end to this ongoing hostility towards jak by the state of Colorado\nAnd and is your feeling that uh\nThe the president of the ruling the seven to ruling in December or will help the lower courts decide this\nGas or when the Supreme Court sent a clear message that tells Colorado you can't have hostility towards jak you can't bring these proceedings against him because you don't like their beliefs and then as you know within weeks after that\nRuling Colorado is back at it again saying oh jak we're going to find another reason to find you in violation of our law we think that's a strong demonstration of the exact hostility that seven members of the court found to be problematic and so I think that's a strong precedent um that we're going to rely on and and hopefully the federal courts will look at that and say yeah\nThis is too much hostility this is unconstitutional um and and dismiss Colorado's charges against jak for the gender identity cake\nWell I mean I Want to be clear ah for folks listening that you know Jack you're Christian ... you're not an anti gay person you are a Christian with all that goes along with that so if somebody comes to you and says I'd like to bake a cake that says I hate gays and because you're a Christian you would not make that cake either\nThat's correct and I've had people with similar requests like I'm just going to do that work on a God Jesus Christ in every way that I Can't I Can't do that I Can't honor him making cakes or hateful or go against his teaching [noise]\nWell I Want people to hear that because you you hear so much

obviously all of the people of that era\nWere slave holder so we know it's a horror but it really doesn't you know like when you think about uh any of them George Washington and Jefferson and and and

I have on Hillsdale professor Bradley birds or who's written a book called in defense of Andrew Jackson uh we were talking about Indian removal or you know that seems like one of those terms that what what the heck does it mean what does it mean exactly in his era\nOr he was dispatched by what the US government to do this who told them to do or what he did with regard to the Native Americans\nActually Eric he's the one giving the orders here so it's when president that he gets through Congress or the very first year he's president gets through Congress will be called the Indian removal act\nThis would have been Eighteen thirty and the goal was to take the tribes mostly in the south but there were a number of northern strides even Michigan here with a pot of water meter Hillsdale there were a number of tribes that were to be removed and they were given land northern charge were given limited Kansas\nAnd the southern trends were given landed Oklahoma\nSo if there was an attempt in a successful attempt at least on the terms of the government terrible if you're an Indian but there was this little but those Indians and ultimately ends up under Martin Van Buren\nWe have uh what was called the trail of tears were the Cherokees were removed and there was a lot of bloodshed involved not because there was open warfare but removal itself was so brutal that a number of people died in\nLike a huge number of people died outrageous number so the removal itself was a disaster but they were sent the Indians were set out white you on that huge Meridian\nWhich was going to be permitted Indian frontier basically on the great plains which is where they were put in Oklahoma and Kansas\nAnd so ah he's reviled for that because he he didn't just executed but he was the one that was pushing for it white\nIt was one of his main the main things that he ran on to the presidency in Eighteen twenty eight and I think for a lot of people so we were asking why did you become

some of\nThe ideas that they were not necessarily walk the new left was trying to reexamine so much of what had happened in American history and it kind of latched on to Andrew Jackson as the old

everything we did wrong at the ... century\nWell thank you for that to a silhouette of certain when no since you've settled in defense of Andrew Jackson let me ask you let's try to get inside his head or inside the heads or who voted for him knowing that this was the policy\nFor which he was advocating what what was the issue because I'm not aware of a ... why somebody would think the Native
