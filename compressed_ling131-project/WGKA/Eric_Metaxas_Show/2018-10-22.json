{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WGKA", "content": "You'll miss is the final formations this hour infomercial for them so I think for much of freedom has a cousin who was a similar name frontiers of freedom seems to share a lot of\nValues with us George lenses their leader and he's joining us now while I'm not much of freedom George\nIs a great deal of you\nHey George give us a little bit of your background who you are and then it introduces the frontiers of freedom\nSure well you know first of all I guess maybe at least as I see myself on the most important things is that I'm the father of seven children and the ah the husband of one [laughter] and uh\nWith my family life is important to me and the poverty line is politics is because like anybody else I Want to see my children inherited a world that is better or at least as good as the one I inherited and I I sometimes feel like we're not at the right direction to make that happen so\nI Want to be involved in those things I'm a rock red conservative I ran for Congress against those trends liberal incumbent and southern Virginia I served in a public school board and I've seen a lot of that sort of games that liberals play and I got very interested in gauging\nAnd trying to uh stand up for freedom and liberty and the principles that we find that the constitution\nWill our constitution is what we veterans took an oath to support and defend so and I think that has to do with keeping our constitution not just an existence but actually having government follow it makes a great deal of sense to me\nOh absolutely and so that's what French is the freedom is about it was founded by Malcolm Wallop lets US Senator conservative Wyoming he served three terms in the U.S Senate\nWhen he retired he founded frontiers of freedom because he wanted to continue to advocate for a constitutional solutions limited government freedom and opportunity and peace or strike\nWell that's what it takes to keep us as a constitutional republic and certainly in my lifetime I'm Seventy seven I've seen an awful lot of movement away from the constitutional republic we were starting to form\nSo yeah I Know a lot of people that are upset with what they see but they don't know what to do about it because I'm taking the frontiers of freedom is or some place they can plug into action we take some action am I right\nAbsolutely our website is very easy it's F F dot O. R. G. F. F.\nDot org like French is freedom you know F F\nF F sort of like that but F F and a bad as they are based on issues that we're working on issues recovery you can sign up there for our newsletter we don't sell your name or anything like that or we will sell you a spam either we typically only send out occasionally emails we only do we think it's important issue otherwise you just come to the website\nWhen it suits you but bottom line is the idea of of liberty is a a\nIt's a fulltime Endeavour you know they say the price of liberty is a turtle vigilance I Would argue that the more modern that an accurate or it's uh you can't just be a passes spectator you have to be a participant got an adult again under the field\nAnd that's hopefully what we can help people do and we try to get information the cell phone we try to fight on their behalf and all the Congress and before even the court sometimes and and most definitely and before the administrative agencies\nWill we absolutely have to do that is a little bit like if you need a car and I gave you one brand new car which actually the six months later and you told me was running terribly and I asked her why have you were putting oil well no I Do have to do well no if you have something valuable like our freedom like our constitution republic you have to take care of it\nNot somebody else and it's that involvement of citizens that is what are our country is lacking\nGod I think that the more we are involved the more accountable we can hold government we will see government against the end to our well priced too often I feel like everyone expects us to bend as well but\nAs we get more involved as we don't just get involved at election time that's important time to be an all but I Would argue we should also be involved in between elections you know that's the beauty of Republicans as that is designed to be responsive to our views and I think too serious are involved I think there's a lot more Americans would agree with that\nAnd always participate and so we need to get those folks activated involved so that ... you can return to Washington\nYes sir visceral doing the Gilman for freedom we're discussing frontiers of freedom with George lander George\nI hear a lot from people because they are frustrated with they don't know what to do you have that kind of a citizen contacted you through your website or whatever what kind of advice what kinds of things would you have them do or encourage them to do or give them resources to do\nAbsolutely will normally when I speak to groups and ... my call to action is often I asked them to contact their congressman and express their opinion you could write him a letter you can call 'em but let them know where you stand and I think\nThat could have a real impact that we saw that in the most recent a judicial nomination hearing is that there were some who wavered and someone who got a message loud and clear that they need to stand up\nAnd they did and then so I think that it's a very valuable to make sure they understand that we feel like you know politely I'm not saying that you call in shout at them and say if you know but I think we can also this is an important issue to me and the nice way to say it leads to this ... this issue about the\nFact that matters so much that how you do on this particular issue will determine whether or not I can support you in the future you know she went on to threaten them and you know but you can say nice like that they've got the message they heard that a guy like okay\nI got it on the staff person takes that call they totally get what you just said um and I think it's more effective than there were so kind of get on the phone and yell at them and tell them they're worthless bombs as far as I give them a very very clear message of what you want them to do on a particular bill and or a particular vote and then tell them how much it matters to you\nI agree with you one of the things that most politicians can do is read minds so if if they're your representative how do they know what you'd like them to do if you don't tell them and I that's the way to communicate is civil ... mostly respectful isn't\nYeah and that doesn't mean wishy washy no not at all suggesting I'm just saying I don't I don't think they'll get more attention if they kind of call up ranting and raving skin and yelling easily they just put the phone down and say that was a crazy person and they ignore you so you want to give them a thoughtful reason why you feel that way and then make sure that they understand that this is an important issue that you\nBuy just letting them know that this is going to impact how you vote this teacher can implied threat but it's done in a way that not I'll drive from off of your fault you know that kind of you know what I made and um I Do think that the reason why being very clear at them as important is because\nThe squeaky wheel on politics will get the you know get the grief most of the time\nAnd then there may be a few very principled members of Congress who will vote right if you do not call them\nBut the truth most of them were swayed by an officer opinion on the left and the crazies in the world are in fact calling up and trying to persuade them\nSo we have to be equally committed and make sure that they understand that we are out there too\nBecause when we don't it makes it look like we don't care and then I was like wow I guess they don't care I guess I'll just go with\nYou know and that's dangerous for us because the odds are not interested in constitutional ... should limited government they're not interested in following the rule of law they look at government as a as something that can provide them with the goodies they'd like as about our men to protect their eye and provide them out there and a level playing field in freedom and opportunity\nWith which they then you have to do something on\nAnd so we have to make sure that when you have to take out our ground and been forcefully and when we do I think we'll see what\nI couldn't agree more and goes contacts have to be regular once a month or whatever which means you have to pay attention so you know what your call him about but respectable regular communication will get their attention I Know what I've seen it happen unless you're George that's awesome\nOne more time George tell us how people can contact plug into frontiers of freedom\nSure they can follow us at S. S. dot ORG and they can um me on the lander F. F. L. A. and the R. I. E. H. with the ... for Georgia in front of the land rush\nAnd if you forget that seems to be done here for about ... to George George thank you for joining us today sanctioned for your concern for our nation thank you for frontiers of freedom I think front lines in frontiers are brothers proud to call your friend\nAbsolutely likewise\nNo sign for our students who've report this is when we find an outstanding performance of duty we get to honor this fine through an army combat veteran who lost three of his limbs from a roadside bomb explosion in Afghanistan appear Saturday on Fox and friends to share is inspiring story about climbing mount Kilimanjaro\nWho my driving forces the five guys who didn't make it home said Adam keys referring to members of his platoon who died from the explosion after being severely wounded two thousand ten he's made it through\nMore than a hundred surgeries he said that after receiving a new prosthetic legs you decided to train for Nineteen thousand foot track of the highest mountain in Africa\nA Purple Heart recipient obviously he's left his medal of the summer of Kilimanjaro directly die servicemen and women around the world who were in this together we've always been he said it was my Purple Heart but I left it on top for all of us he added that the climbed took him six days and the train for six months repairs body\n... most people said they train for a year year and a half he said he's next big tests just run into New York city marathon on November fourth\nSo stand tall Adam ... front lines of freedom in our nation's patriots salute you\nThis includes the first hour of the show will start to second are reviewing a new book with the author wrote was a freedom ...

conclude with our weekly mail back through history under under America report groups I welcome your comments and questions contact me through front lines of freedom dot com [noise] now it's time to discuss ... book [noise]\nIt's really a conclusion it's called blind man's rage skip this is more than a single book it's a it's sort of a conclusion of a series isn't it [noise]\nYes this is the conclusion book four of the series is a military adventure Syria's apocalyptic in nature set in the United states primarily in Michigan where I live but yeah it's the conclusion it's taken me about\nEight years to write all these years garden eight years ago with with ... one right yep book won the God virus\nYeah that's a good book I even read it [laughter] well I used very small words I had you in mind any truth of I Believe you\nWell of course I'm a Marine I don't know a lot of large words\nAnyways I was always a model ... but I Am working on my bicycle riding a good good I'm going for real\nOkay sort of talk us through the\nOf four books sure they about yeah the first book\nI'd virus basically it starts out in Wisconsin and there is a terrorist attack on the U.S power grid\nAll the power goes down for all the U.S course the U.S retaliates against China and Russia and so by the time everything is done when all the first on flying\nAlmost the entire world his without power and it's about basically the aftermath of an attack like that you're going back in time a hundred and fifty years people weren't equipped for that so a lot of people\nEnd up just dying off simply because they can't live in an environment like that and it's about man named Dan who just happens to be a Marine Corps veteran probably yes sergeant you know\nAnd uh his son who would have to travel from northwest Wisconsin all the way over to northern Michigan to get back to his home town where he was raised by his uncle Rodney who turns out to be the commanding general\nOf an organization called the shadow militia and the shadow militia is book to a hot and I suspect\nThe shadow militias a bunch of patriots\nIt is a bunch of patriots you know we all know about militias you know they're quite vilified in the media has these days but the militia basically as everyone who can bear arms\nThat you know the principle of our constitution yeah founded on the fact that the militia is the people\nWell the shadow militia fictional obviously is based on the the premise that\nNo one knows the shuttle militia exist they are a shadow organization of the regular militia not even the regular militia knows that they exist\nAnd so that keeps them out of the limelight they were formed primarily for a situation such as this\nWhere America was in dire need where they needed help where they needed someone to step up and re establish a constitutional government and that's what the shadow Malaysia is all about and uncle Rodney you know a a general Rodney T branch is the commanding general of that army\nThat is one\nVery real possible scenario I mean the fact that our power grids are so vulnerable not just ours ever yeah there's nothing unbelievable about that scenario\nAnd it's also often reasonable if they're a bunch of people with enough foresight to be trying to prepare for this and we really need them to be people who want to our constitutional ... and it sounds like that's the shadow militia\nYeah you know exactly there's no shortage of people who just want power yes you know further their own agenda but someone who wants to reestablish constitutional government and then step away by all out and go on with their lives I mean that's that's in along the bane of\nGeorge Washington it is indeed this girl going to go on the front lines of freedom we're discussing ... book blind man's rage okay that's two of the four was number three\nNumber three the third book is called the stairs and tied\nAnd Michigan is kind of special over near Detroit there's a city called Dearborn Dearborn is one of the largest concentrations of Islamic communities outside of the Mid East I Believe it is the largest I wouldn't surprise me at all by now\nBut you know basically what happens in this book is\nThere is an extremist leader takes over in the aftermath of this a terrible debacle and he raises an army and Islamic army\nTo conquer all of the mid west and he heads over toward Grand Rapids Kalamazoo and then on up north towards on you know the him general Rodney T branch the commanding general of the shadows militia\nWho is a little more than this guy can conquer and so that's what this book is about is uncle Rodney the shadow of militia against the stairs and army\nAnd the service and army I presume is to establish an Islamic state caliphate correct yeah okay well that's not beyond ... either so that must be an interesting book I guess you got to buy the book and read it to find out who is\nWell yes you do I can't ah well the good guys always about what I see I got really good why Israel every\nBook I've ever heard of yours [laughter] and you've got how many books out of fourteen or something or twelve twelve okay maybe I'm leaving the too far forward in the foxhole okay and the last one would you just finished\nThe last one is called the blind man's rage and that's where uncle Rodney the shadow of militia has to take on\nThe instigator of all of this the power behind the scenes his name is Jared Thompson AK of the blind man then he's the one who attacked the power grid and took everything down so that he could insert himself\nAs the leader of the United states of America and so it's the final clash between the blind man and the shadow militia\nWill that there is somebody behind the scenes and that person is particularly powerful and the person has a pretty good plan\nAnd the means to make it happen that's all realistic and indeed there was about two hundred countries in our world today about about Seventy five percent of them are ruled by somebody like that and she's right there called desperate [laughter] so uh to say that's that's very realistic\nHopefully it'll never happen but it was really appropriate\nOkay and your book ... rage is for books together in one cover well\nNo the blind man's rage is a separate book I'm now getting ready to release all four books under one cover\nThat's what I was getting to okay and what does it does for put together called\nIt's called the God virus series a God Cyrus series how can people get a copy you can get a copy of any of my books just by going to Amazon dot com search on skipped core yell and it'll pop right up\nThere we're going to give away a copy of the book to at the end of the show folks but I've read a significant number of skips books and I think you'll find them hard to put down their fun a little scary sometimes [laughter] but it's nice to know that the good guys always when\nSkip what's in the future of\nYour in your books got anything else in your mind or you try\nTo yeah I Do I think we can safely say it's not going to be a harlequin romance because if I ever wrote a romance probably most of the characters would die as but what I'm thinking about now is uh I'm thinking of a devotional book uh called concealed carry for Christians\nWell I certainly think Christians should carry concealed and I'd rather have only Christians ... I had actually\nSkip thank you that was fun it's nice to know that you do something besides co host and hunt and can store stuff this is fun I Can't wait till your next book is done All right well thank you very much Carl\nI'm going to let it go next to shoot the ball with an army vet and businessman then we'll cover a service academy football you a reporter for the front\nLines of freedom this is colonel Danny Gillum hit the debt right now and rest starting positions with a push up it's called the front leaning rest\nGet into the frontline rest position\nI think patriotic thoughts stay there until I return one Chilean me [noise]\n[noise] pardon ashes a proud sponsor the front lines of freedom and we'd like to thank all listeners for their support of in service to our country sparked national distributor of grocery products to us commissaries and exchanges around the world\nYou know washing your kids do well and anything is fun but you have the hunting and fishing club at West point I was captain of the west point chess club I couldn't play chess very well but I was really going to study the trips so that has happened what's\n[laughter] but the toll taker right I think I Belong to the drama club the Spanish club whatever club the ... freeway turned out of there but it was definitely a fun part of my time there\nWas they were about out of time going back to your profession is there any kinds of advice you would like our listeners to know that some inside you might share it might\nHave been in the Employee Benefit in human resource arena for about Twenty years\nIt's a tremendous field I I think a lot of people in the Employee Benefit arena have been kind of a lot of the people that are for a long time I've been chased away because of all the fears round healthcare reform in this projection that the government's going to take over health care\nUnder any scenario and I don't think our company that our country's ever to go to like a single payer a government run system but even if we did go to something like that there's plenty of opportunity in this industry for professionals like us to get into an add value to companies because companies are always going to compete for talent in this country\nSo from a career perspective and I think everybody in the military is discipline they're smart they work harder ambitious this industry I think it's got just tremendous potential in the future so happy to talk to anybody about you know what that looks like for them\nCool how could people contacting through my a Web site will show benefits group dot com an easy way to do it or they can always email me David that socal that says okay well we'll start benefits dot com\nAnd then you lose that put me down here for about ...

order\nWe fully support the right to keep and bear arms for all law abiding families and we encourage you to find out about the laws governing use of deadly force in your state and follow them to the letter and of course don't forget to follow the rules of safety and commonsense whenever you're carrying a firearm to protect the ones you love what's the story this week colonel\nWill the man who lives in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle was awake is it for a one day in July and by the way this was before Seattle mayor Johnny ... signed a law ordering firearms to be locked up we're not a news\nWell a burger broke into the mud room at his home resident grabbed his hand gun before investigated the source of the noise the shooter was trying to get into the main part of the house so the homeowner fired shooting him in the stomach it was later caught when the cohorts took him to a hospital for care\nThanks colonel in this particular scenario I like to focus on firearms storage especially in light of the Seattle law that requires firearms to be locked up when news\nOf course all is responsible gun owners already know in practice that concept so there's really no need to legislate it however for those few out there who do not already lock up their guns would not unused let's go over some of the ways to secure your firearm\nFirst of all when the gun is on your person either in a holster or some other carrying device it is considered secure and in use whether that's a whole store fanny pack doesn't really matter we're talking about an on body carry method where you are in complete control of the guns simply because it is attached to you and follows you wherever you go\nHarris some requirements I levy on all my ...\nNumber one it must be secure the whole idea of locking the gun up is to keep it out of unauthorized hands if the safest is dirty enough to keep a kid from breaking into it then get something different you should buy the best quality gun safe you can afford\nI've seen people run out and buy a twelve hundred dollar Kimber pistol and then lock it in a tin cash box from Walmart that constantly nine Ninety five folks don't do this\nNumber two the gun safe must be in a location that makes it readily accessible to all authorized users I staged my gun safe and guns on all levels of my home simply because you never know when the bad guy will invade you or where he will break into your home it could be on the main floor second floor or even in the basement\nAnd last you must be able to open your guns they've quickly and easily well under extreme stress\nHaving to remember a long digital combination or use it dialed open it is simply unacceptable\nEven worse yet is needing a key to access to safe first you have to find the key then you have to insert it and it just takes way too much time\nStick with a lid digital keypad or RFID technology or even biometric fingerprint opening methods and you'll not be disappointed the bottom line is you are responsible for the security of your gun so get the best you can afford and keep it simple and keep it safe\nShe that makes sense even from learning [laughter] troops\nListen up on veterans' day we're going to start a new program thanks for the input you all have sent in I Need more input or goes on each show to honor the cease military person not superstars but the average soldier sailor marina ... they don't have to serve in combat but they do have to have served honorably on active duty guard reserves\nHere's how to nominate someone send me about two hundred and fifty

Sacco and we'll also talk about the importance of voting with David ...\nMore at ... dot com November midterms are scarcely\nMore than two weeks away\nMail in ballots are already flowing in early voting underway Congress's in the crosshairs of the electorate will Democrats get power back in the house and what about the set it to the gym actually gain seats two three four several current democratic seats are in the spotlight\nNose in North Dakota Indiana Florida but nothing\nThan Missouri doesn't come and Democrat Claire McCaskill wants to hang on to her seat against her very able challenger Missouri's attorney general Josh Hawley my colleague Larry Elder spoke with James O'Keefe of project maritime this time keeps investigative team do deep inside the McCaskill campaign\nWe've got some news because Claire McCaskill sheriff responded to our hidden camera investigation she attacked a video of course but she made a false statement in this state that she put out a she said the Republican candidate for Senator John Ali\nHad fraud you normally embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct I had nothing to do with Josh all that never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved in this investigation and just your listeners know our investigation McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that her and all the cat's gonna bottles policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that uh other staffers talked about banning semi automatic rifles and mechanical herself was caught on camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that they would be a gun than the sum type so the capitals now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nTeams of teeth I looked at the video not only the the Stanford talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they talk about and guns Clara herself talks about um when she gets in the Senate will vote with so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there's the red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are moderate they're not left in their their their moderate the pro life pro gun Democrats it's still a thing in Missouri do what I'm saying these playing stage so what is the big Asian exposures is that in order to get elected\nIn order to get elected you have to lie to the people and that's what all the aperture saying the thing the moderate we'll just have to get over being lied to very devastating very powerful\nI mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we've ever done because it involves a sitting US Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling or wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill's response James okay\nWell it is some startling Josh how I Would be part of fraudulently in betting on me and my campaign\nNice the attorney general of the state of Missouri he's supposed to be going after fried\nNot participating in it [laughter] so um there was nothing there have been very upfront about all my positions I made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment which really telling about this\nIs how how far they are willing to go to fraud you only in bed somebody in my campaign\n[noise] well first of all it does it mean the whole thing lie it's categorically unequivocally falls\nJosh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I've never met him and she didn't live on local TV in Missouri Larry what's gonna happen next to this other than a candidate John always say that had\nNothing to do with it she's going to respond to that so I think we're we're achieving our goal of holding people accountable and I think that she's in a lose lose situation\nHurricane that ravaged the Florida Panhandle northward from the Gulf was horribly unpredictable and death toll is now past thirty Kendall air force base near Panama City took a serious and it's one of the size of our elite after twenty two fighter jets lights they were concerned with our nation's fighting ability to be concerned about that\nI turn to a regular on my program Congressman Mike Gallagher a mouse armed services committees are defence expert at a marine\nCorps intelligence veteran himself\nLet's get right down to it the danger zone has receded according to I'm writing a real clear politics story here the congressional leadership fund has seen see six districts will hurt Andy Barr Mike tossed Rodney Davis Brian Mast John Katko receipt and to save comfortable territory it if we're down to twenty to\nAdditive and they sound pretty optimistic it on hold the house or Mike Gallagher what do you think\nWell this is anecdotal but certainly in the Republican Party ... as we have around my district and are they just got than we've seen an upsurge in\nVolunteers coming in people coming in that aren't necessarily party faithful to pick up signs and ask\nWhat can I Do to help so I Do sense a slight\nMomentum shift I always thought this was going to be a night that when we talk about control the house you know five each one way or the other\nUh but also my understanding is that our we have real opportunities to pick up some seats from Democrats in Minnesota and that the Democrats are pulling out of a couple of states that look it'd be treading in our direction so again we got to run through the tape\nThis is you know we're fighting against the forces of history here can't take anything for granted and ultimately it's just going to come down\nThe candidate quality and sort of the twenty to thirty states that we are talking about here\nSo let me talk to you about some defense issues first of all the twenty to ten dull a it's a murky picture or I read this very close and it seems like people are trying to say yeah we got her but we didn't get hurt bad bad but maybe we did get hurt that bad maybe a danger to stealth technology are very hard to repair\nWhat's your assessment at why by the way do we keep at twenty twos at our hurricane area\nSo as best I can tell and trying to read through that and I'm looking forward to being back in session in November So we can ask the hard questions of the aid figure out what exactly happened\nIt seems like Seventeen twenty twos or damage\nI think ten of those are cats and the storm rated hangar but no hangar is built to withstand a hundred and fifty plus miles per hour winds and seven of the seven of the Seventeen were lesser rented hangers\nI think it's important to note that no one thought this would be a four to five little avert imported our fire I'm not trying to make excuses for the military here on the planes are based in those so that they can have access\nTo the training range of of the Gulf of Mexico no one would want a bunch of that twenty two going into super cruise over Kansas it's too disturbing to the local community\nWe also wouldn't want people to be able to film and monitor their operations that we're safer areas of the country\nSo as best I can tell him talking to officials talking to experts on the outside it looks like most of them will be repaired but the problem here is the skin on the plane there's a lot of radar absorbent material ram involved and the repairing and replacing could be very expensive\nAnd my understanding of the missile site survey suggests that the air frame\nAppear to be okay so we believe we can get most of them back on track but we're preparing the skin um will be a very expensive proposition finally I just stay out of your question why were so many their ground this goes back\nReally to the Obama administration decision to halt the program a two thousand nine\nDr Gates was the ultimate decided that there's ... and the decision to cut back on the air force personnel and train maintain ers and funds for reading it so we had to answer the reason that the question that so many were on the ground and the first place with their engines pulled it because of the lack of spare parts and a lack\nOf trained people short hair that President doing we're the job campaigning when candidates in vulnerable critical house and Senate races you know highly took time to praise the work of some of America's political and military heroes who I Am from the state [noise] so what is the civil war general Ulysses Grant was preceded by the mention of grants number one\nGeneral Robert ... blurry older shows how media misuse or semi to paint Trump\nAs a racist Trump is being criticized for praising General Robert we\nAlways say that gave us a great president who has it been properly recognized OK William McKinley he has not been properly records it also gave you [noise]\nHave general [noise] who is incredible he drank a little bit too much [noise] you know I'm Talking about\nStill Robert Daly it was a great general\nCan you hear that he says so Robert ... what a great general\n[noise] still Robert\n... it was a great general change that [noise]\nAnd [noise] Abraham Lincoln develop a phobia he couldn't be Robert ... he was going crazy I don't know if you know the answer but Robert Daly was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln jam mommy I Can't speak Robert Daly\nAnd one day it was really bad and what did you just said you\nHardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem [noise]\nAnd like you said I don't get what probably as you guys aren't women [noise]\nAnd his name was grant general [noise]\nAnd he\nWho felt like he had the okay it from the crown prince to do this rendition and who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nWill that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the facts of the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday what are the second offends me six a sufficient for the United states\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared its intelligence Turkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video of from inside the conflict showing who did well in excess in Asia you know they've got they've got the goods\nIf they've shared that wish there U.S intelligence got it buys who often work very closely with the Turks\nAnd then that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree\nOf seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on us to try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nRight now does it impact for example the war in Yemen and this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses who's Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel and America\nTrying to confront the who the shore were sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome to tie as being a necessary course correction the middle east\nUh I'm not sure that has any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not a I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish this whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday\nYou know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a ... operator before the Saudis have begun to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nCan therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it as an exotic story and reads like a trailer I'm a ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long every Patrick\nYeah I think they're trying to say before where it's going to hit the crown prince is with elite opinion you know the wall street and Silicon Valley or he's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and they're no out help diversify the Saudi economy\nHe's going to find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort and that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia over the not too long term has got some real issues in terms of being able to support their economy on their oil revenue\nTo listen to the
