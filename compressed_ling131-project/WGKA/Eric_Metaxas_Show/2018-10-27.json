R. M. U. D. to eight seven to two two A. R. M. E. D. to eight seven to two to eight seven to two to please don't do it while you're driving\nAnd check out the gun the day if you win the other day I Would love to hear from you market armed American radio dot O. R. G. or just about anything I Love getting emails from you always a lot of fun and got a bunch of them this week that I'm going to be getting back to because there were some really good ones including still getting email\nOn the Army Corps of engineers I told you how to get the permit to carry a firearm a corps of engineers property and I'm Still getting responses that a lot of you thanking me for that a lot of you've gotten your permit some of you wanting to know hey I just heard that on the podcast from a long time ago can you tell me how to do that I Do a lot of\nYou know I recreate quite a bit on corps of engineers property and would love to carry my farm so I'll be getting back to those of you have written we had to promise you that\nCome back to add to use your voice of reason for the final segment Andy you care to make any predictions\nAbout the about Kansas before we switch gears\nOh boy well I tell you why I put it on the spot buddy of mine\nWell hey you know what I think that we're going to keep all for house seats that we have in the state of Kansas I think it is going to be a really close race in the second district as I mentioned with an open seat with the season the Democrat who's been in the state legislature for like six years tried to run a whole bunch of different positions and last but ah the\nUn seasoned non politician Republican that we have Steve Watkins who's a solid military guys sell conservative and do he he loves his guns as well and I think we're going to keep that seat as well it's going to be close but I think we'll get it so I think we maintain all four seats here I mean we are in a really really dead heat within I mean they're tied it like forty two percent right now it's a Republican and Democrat\nOr for the governor's race we have a third party candidate just floating around ten percent is pulling predominantly from the left side of the aisle\nBut that was it a toss up right now I I Am really good friends are friends with Kris Kobach I absolutely love what she does I've I'm supporting him a two hundred and ten percent and I really hope it gets in there but that was really close but I'll give it to them I think that we can pull away with this and I think that we can keep Kansas solidly red across the board\nI agree with you hundred percent let's go to the let's go to a Congress\nU.S House of representatives now I'm I'm On record I think I think again just like I said during the presidential campaign in twenty sixteen I said tomorrow morning a lot of people are going to wake up very surprised at what happens Trump plus three hundred electoral votes I'll see you tomorrow that was how I close out the show on Tuesday of the election I was right and I still have my kids you know so\nPeople going to pick my lottery numbers for me it was going to get three hundred and six electoral votes that's a plus three hundred elect to our meeting over three hundred so I was right on that I still in the U.S house is going to see fortified read the pick up and I still think the Senate is going to see two to three pickups as well blue waivers immediate created term now I may be wrong\nOkay if I'm wrong well I'm wrong but I'll tell you what if I'm right and you won't hit me for some lottery tickets what do you think in the U.S house in the Senate\nI'm with you I think that we're going to keep especially the house I mean come on they're not going to win over what do we have like a thirty five forty point majority in the in the house it's not going to happen they're not going to win that many uh no I think that we may lose a couple in the house I don't think we're going to gain any but I think we'll definitely keep them majority\nWhen it comes to the Senate we do have that ... vote majority in the U.S in the Senate they say it's a sure fire when for them to win the Senate even a couple of our congressmen here in Kansas think that they're going to lose the Senate and it turned blue but I'm the eternal optimist I was I'm with you I think that we're going to be able to maintain its not pick up a seat or two in the Senate and be able to keep it read\n[noise] oh I I don't I I have no doubt if I was to doubt anything I Would doubt the house\nI doubt you know keeping the house more than I Will descent I think the Senate is is going to stay solid red ... close going to be very close but I Do think we pick up two or three states I'm at this stage of the game I think matching the safe unfortunately pastors in a fight for his life\nYou know high camp done there there's a couple of them that that are going to be interesting and fun to watch but I think you see one two maybe three Republican pickups in the Senate not surprised to keep the Senate not surprise to keep the house now\nOn a bigger know\nWhen the Democrats realized after the midterms and they're still gonna realize after the midterms anti that Trump is still president what do you think happens between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty\nOh well you know it's funny you mentioned that I have a guest and national guess what I bring on all the time uh and I'll give them a plug Gerard marrow or he's done a lot of predictions you studied a lot of elections since the beginning of the founding of the nation has written a couple of books great news for America dot com and he's a great guy and him on the show quite a bit she predicts that the Democrat Party will crumble\nUnderneath their own way and that they will rise a new a brand new like actual legit socialist party but the Democrat Party will be no more\nNo I don't know if I take it that far but I think that if they end up losing them in terms of the blue a mentality that they think they're going to have that they're going to try to do the impeachment they're going to try and bring back Obamacare they going to try and repeal the tax cuts and they don't get any of this\nI think that they are stuck\nIn a really bad place and they will do something crazy drastic because they're not going to handle it any more I mean you are wrenching and the last statement about the people that are just so angry all the time and don't know how to handle Trump being in office I like to think about something for just a second the millennials like you mentioned the millennials my generation\nThe very first election that we get to vote in was Iraq Obama in two thousand eight\nThat was the very first election that we got to have the we get to partake in the end they won they never experienced ... feet and remember this was the generation\nThat that really patient trophy\nThis is the generation that's never been told no by their parents they got the participation trophy all throughout their life\nAnd that they feel that they could walk through life do whatever they want you they finally lost and they don't know how to handle it which is why we're seeing the outcry and the response that we are right now nationally with the anti ... and all these members that are throwing temper tantrums across the country they've never experienced\nThis before so they lose again\nI don't know what to expect from them I don't know who they're going to put up\nFor the twenty twenty race where there's going to be a Cory Booker well there's going to be a Kamala Harris I don't know what they're going to go more extreme and try Bernie Sanders again I don't know but we're in New territory to where they're trying things they've never done before because they've never been in this position the way they had before\n... ... that's a fantastic point I've I don't think I've ever heard anybody phrase it like that that's that's a wonderful point I appreciate you bringing that up and mentioning it really gives us some things to think about and I'll tell you what's interesting about what Andy just said was don't talk directly you know and that is you'll notice he says they don't he's a part of that millennial generation and have you every time I talked to catch you saying that\nAnd it it it's interesting to me tell me why you do that\nWell it's because obviously I'm part of the millennial generation but they don't represent the the fringes out probably the ones that throw the ... they don't represent me and look there's a lot of millennials that are conservative that that feel bad\nBecause our reputation as being damage because we're part of that uh we don't like to be represented in that sense but there is a division of my generation where either you have the compass of conservatism understand things or you've gone through schooling so much to where you think Bernie Sanders has the answers on finances which is just hysterical I mean ... Alexander Ocasio Cortez\nIn all of her ... she has made on the public scene saying that somehow we're going to fund the forty trillion dollar social program a Medicare for all and also the garbage she's talking about and then when she tries to debate her Republican opponent who what\nAn economics professor at the universities are it shows how silly that they actually are but they do it cognitive biased understanding of how it was\nA that there's truth in respect to counter what they're saying but they don't want to listen to it because it doesn't fit the narrative so they put the horse blinders on and the continued on the trench that has them that is not me and we need to decide for between the two 'cause there are many conservative millennials literally that are trying to wave and jump up and down and say hey I'm not representative is don't let me into that category\nYou know it's interesting we wish we had another hour oh\nYou have thrown some red meat on the table rather you you really have but I Want to go back to the point you made about you don't know how they're going to handle this after they lose because here's what's going to happen\nThey are going to lose the midterms even if they gain the house because Trump is still president Andy germ comes not going anywhere any attempt to impeach him in the house will fail and it will certainly not go anywhere in the Senate and he went to ... and and then you know ... to\nYou ... your your the cofounder of signature bank of New York uh you you have a background\nOr on Wall street private equity equity venture capital um and uh you've been a commentator on\nUm ... well on financial issues and many other things so what is it a that brings you to write a book you a financial person or on the subject of faith the religion atheism how did how did we get here\nWell in a certain kind of way we got here when I was ten years old I was sitting at my parents are might particularly my father my father was a Holocaust survivor and was liberated by the Americans luckily and made his way to Chicago\nAnd he was playing poker at the Jewish lithuanian Columbus Chicago and one day just before Russia and I'm not that far from this time of year\nThat one of the they were playing poker and one of the one of his fellow said don't go to Russia Shonda services this year how can we go to high holiday services this year where was God when we needed help and everybody stopped talking and it is in the air when people didn't talk about their experiences and the whole cause I seldom heard\nOne person says there is no God get over it we're out around the next person at the table says a ... that\nThis was a failure of of people look at all of our Christian neighbors they watched as we were deported than in my father's case watch this is my father's father was murdered my grandfather was murdered and did nothing in other parts\nInstead you know what we can't understand the world Israel wouldn't have happened\nWithout the Holocaust so a greater good even though that's hard to stop make a greater good came from all from six million people being murdered and since then I've always wondered about that court question that\nPeople asked which is how can a nominee benevolent God allow evil on earth and so I've been in a way of thinking about this question since before was bar mitzvahed at and they'd been bubbling with me\nAnd I've I've as I've grown older I've heard so many people say that it's not rational to believe in God and run with all we know about science in the history of the of the Bible and and modern morality and frankly I think that's totally wrong\nI've read all the books I read all the books that Richard ... not all of them but I read most of what Richard Dawkins wrote Christopher Hitchens Daniel dented even you've all Harare and I'm Steven Pinker and people would say well I read sapiens and I'm an atheist or read I read ... Hawkins and I'm an atheist and I say\nYou haven't really sat down and thought about these things and I\nYou know the geared if nobody's doing it a\nIn a way that I'd like I'm going to do it in a\nWay of her life now you where did you grow up I grew up in Chicago did grow up in Chicago um and you you were raised what as as a nominal do was was was was your Jewish faith a central to life in any way was this is something that you had privately going on\nMostly it was private so when my father arrived ... into the right one more I'm more but just one more to more words about my father my father was liberated was sixty pounds um he had been slave labor he had been in the concentration camps and luckily it was liberated by the Americans who nursing I'm ...\nPounds ... pounds set is practically impossible to think of\nIf he had been liberated uh with his if he had been liberated a week later he would've been debt I wouldn't be here today I mean he was on the verge of death and so he watched his father be murdered his uh his\nBrother was murdered his uncles were murdered my closest relative as a second cousin once removed\nBasically um everybody was murdered and so\nShe was one of those folks who was certain that there was a God and he was certain that there was a God because so many things happened during the course of him getting to Chicago that they couldn't have happened unless there was a God in his in his mind but he was angry it got\nAnd you know what he had a right to be yeah and I think there was and he so he didn't speak to ... went to services made sure we were there I ... on Russia's shutting 'em ... rolled meaning Hebrew school but he wasn't going to sell God and I think they were both God and my father were giving each other\nThe silent treatment and you know I think both sides understood what was going on [laughter] wow wow wow wow\nOkay so so you go or you go into finance you have obviously been successful founding banks and a ... at what point did did you settle in your mind that you believed in God was that something that that and that happened to your early honors or something much more recently as you're struggling with these uh atheist books\nWell that journey started actually I was at the Chicago public schools and that journey actually started when I was a freshman in high school\nI went to I was we were doing the dissection I assume they still do the fetal pig\nYeah and I had had enough Hebrew school to know I've heard about the six day sort of thing and evolution versus creationism and I went up to my teacher I knew from us why a little bit he was which is a conservative Jewish youth group price and I said Mr do but\nI said we're ... we're learning about um ... you know how the fetal big ah you know goes through all the steps to bits of its evolution right how does this square with the Bible\nAnd are already looked at me and he started a mother a few things and then he gave a shrug\nAnd I started thinking well look I'm not getting the the answers\nHere so is my ... by the time I was a junior I transferred myself into either crunch Jewish academy in Chicago and I said I'm going to at least\nKnow whether I Believe or I don't believe and that's really what started me on my head Ernie that's amazing\nAnd the funny thing is that on ... ... ... ... is not even true I mean in this day and age you know that that's the ... and that that was based on those ah what is it that the heckled drawings that they just you know these things\nGet picked up and they put them in in textbooks and they go on and on and on and you know fifty years later they realize oh that that's wrong and meanwhile you have an several generations of people who\nWalk around it was on the test it's got to be right you know who knows a planet where do you want from me and then you really no no no that's not true actually so it is interesting um but so yeah early on you actually decided that you wanted to know\nYou are not everyone's like that everybody got Craig's assault differently but you really want to know at an early age so what happened where did you go to college where you at any kind of a\nA a God worshiper in college where were you\nSo I um the ... the import informative thing for me which was I'm grateful for every day is when I transferred the Hebrew high school I learned to read the text and Hebrew\nAnd then opened up a whole new world for me or not that there's anything against reading the text in any other language yeah but for me it just made my understanding much deeper\nAnd I became a\nSort of a lifelong seeker I consider myself a hopefully a lifelong learner I there was no magic moment where I suddenly became observance right um it was something that happened over time and I really really needed to reason my way to every step you know why should\nI keep ... why should I keep kosher I'm not one of those folks who just does stuff because other people are doing it so it it it took me literally decades and in this book is is to some degree some of the research I did started decades ago I was I'm\nI'm I'm trying to reason out well\nHow do you square evolution and God how do you square the creation of the universe how do you square modern morality with what we read in the Bible you know people have tremendous criticism biblical morality and so I had it thinks are each and every those questions\nFor myself well it's terrific go we're going to go to we're going to go to a break here but uh we are a talking to scotch Shay or in the book is in good faith questioning religion and atheism is the project so stick around [noise] did you hear\nMe now are on [noise]\n\nUse opinion inside am nine twenty the answer [noise] hello [noise]\n\nI don't see how my life can get any better [noise]\nEverything she feels like everything around me is falling apart if something doesn't change soon I just don't know what else I can do [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] some counseling is here to help our team of license Christian ... want to help you get through this we can begin a conversation when you're ready now I text your phone or even video conferencing from the comfort of your own home\nI'd like to give you your first week free to try faithful counseling dot com let's talk go right now to try faithful counseling dot com we really want to help you it's so easy to get started and your first week is free to go now to try faithful counseling dot com let us help\nBut they are so up put off by worshipping God because that impinges on their uh ability to do whatever they like so they have to say there is no God so they end up worshipping themselves anytime you worship anything other than the actual God of the Bible\nUm ... it becomes I dollar tree doesn't it\nYeah well every person is corrupt double\nAnd um we I think a ... not enough attention is given to the real meaning of the way we choose counted the third commandment course Christians kind of the second commandment which is not to take God's name and then and then to take out take the shot in Hebrew\nAnd it's the only of the ten commandments by the way for which there was no redemption of repentance says that writing the commandment\nAnd what does that mean to me it means when people set themselves up ... sold spokespeople for God\nAnd we've seen that in history we have currently whenever anybody says look believe you don't ... don't believe in me because of me believe me because I'm the soul I can give you the sole answer to what God wants you can get in the same sort of trouble which is how\nMuch do the is the religion get in trouble right people say look\nJust listen to me you don't have to go behind the or don't bother reading the scriptures don't bother reasoning for it right all\nRight that's that's fast and then of course that was the ... the Luther issue I wrote a biography of Martin Luther and it's so fascinating because you realize that at the heart that he wasn't really a ... all he was doing really was challenging the authority of the church and the pope and saying look you have to bow\nTo a higher authority just as I Do and if you don't do that you have no legitimate authority and they said oh no no you're wrong what we'd say goes right we are the ultimate authority where the ultimate arbiter of what God says or didn't say you have no right even the question it and at that moment you realized\nTheir goose is cooked when you when you have that when you arrogant to yourself that kind of power and authority you take the place of God\nWhich is really creepy yes and deadly\nYou've got and that's what Luther tried to do when you do an excellent job of showing of of of demonstrating that is to reclaim the Bible would learn the scriptures on your own see what it says you don't have to take the local priests opinion is it\nThat I mean it's a tricky thing right because you don't want to or you don't want to say that everything is subjective that whatever your point of view is is valid no no no when I mean we're not saying that and Luther didn't say that right at the same time we do need to take the responsibility to dig in\nFor ourselves and to be careful not to just listen to somebody because they seem like they're right but to\nBut to understand that they are falling human beings as well and we can't a ... at the end of the day it's between us in God and it's our responsibility when we come back folks will continue the conversation we're talking with Scott Shay S.

H. A. Y. the book is in good faith questioning religion and atheism is kind of just ...\nEight or to get to know you a little bit and to to see the work you put into this book I I Love the idea because it's so close to my heart of trying to get people to think for themselves about what is right in true and I mean I think the reason you and I want people to do that is because we actually believe that if you do that\nIt will lead you to the God of the Bible you'll say holy cow this is true and I think so many people don't do that they kind of take whatever they kind of you know ... from the guy says it blows by and they're not really going to go deeper if you go deeper you'll find that truth challenges\nThe guys that that ... where we are today or in the culture\nThat there's so much in this culture that is against God and against truth but we actually have to know that to stand against it\nRight I I ... a hundred percent agree there's so much bad faith part of the reason I titled the book in good faith is there's so much bad faith with people place their faith in all sorts of things that don't make sense the good news about the Bible and about ... about worshipping the God of the Bible is that\nWhile you can never proved got\nThe God of the Bible the Bible that is a God that is consistent with reason so we have a reason to put our faith in God people put their faith there was a recent Pew study of significant number of people in the United states think that their spirits and rocks that they are all sorts of strange things going on in the world\nAnd what I've tried to do is to show that you can only provide evidence I mean there was no way to say you can prove there is a God and indeed I think and I go into the book why I think that would almost be a bad idea would remove moral choice from us but\nIf you but what I think is\nI think that if you spend the time and do the digging that the evidence for God the evidence that we can find is totally consistent with God and I said that from science I say that from the history of city the Bible\nI say that from understanding our modern morality and when we don't have God is part of the equation when we place or when we place bad faith like faith and dollar tree or face and things are faith in money ...\nUm we can go and a lot of bad directions and that's really when the horror start and unfortunately we've seen too many of them throughout history yeah\nWell it it it's fascinating to me that uh you're coming from the perspective of a of a believing Jew usually the argument\nOr is with a somebody like me a Christian versus atheist but you're you're coming at it from a slightly different point of view and you're not arguing for the a divinity of Jesus or you're you're talking about God in the Bible in the most basic sense and you have\nDetermined uh through years of study that it's true it's really his wrist the the Bible that to me is one of the most fascinating things the idea that centuries past and the more\nWe discover the more true the Bible is known to be I mean we keep discovering and what was it Fifteen Years ago the steel at the Taliban deal the Taliban and they are and where you look there's more archaeological evidence always pointing in the direction of the history of the of the Bible and you\nThat I Know I mean unfortunately the ten commandments is not actual video footage of the ... no I Know we take it to buy on\nIt's yeah it can be but I'm sure everybody pressed up against the water rising away to walk maybe it was a little ... I was a little slippery mud but I'm sure they viewed it as a miracle that wrote down that way right\nWell see that's what's so interesting is that you know when you talk about what is a miracle a if God's hand was involved in it I mean if you're standing there and there are six million of you and you're about to be killed or whatever by the Egyptian army and suddenly\nHey there's a place to walk where there wasn't a place to walk twenty minutes ago something happened and let's go this way and he was scape and then pharaohs army has drowned in the very place where you to most people would say that as a miracle\nAre now the details of the details and you're you're giving us some more naturalistic explanation I Know a lot of people would disagree with you on all kinds of ah things some would say that the whole thing never happen but it's fascinating I Love this is why I wanted to have you on because talking about this rationally\nAnd saying look we first of all we don't have a dog in the fight whatever happened\nHappened we just want to know what is right and a\n... some of the stuff we can know some of the stuff we can speculate on and if we're wrong well it is what it is you know it's it's not like it has to be this otherwise my faith crumble but what you're talking about it's fascinating I I mean I've heard of this before but you you're a you write about an in depth and this book\nAnd I think by taking the tech seriously to and really looking at the words yeah I think there are some things that we take for granted that\nMany believers think that we have to question I think the numbers six hundred thousand is relate males so I analyze what the word is it's it's ... it's six hundred thousand in in is how it's in is how it's written but when I went back\nAnd spend some time and read a number of a ... just review aloof\nAs you may know the Bible it the ... the tower was waiting without bottles which just makes it hard during their vows were very rare in those days did very expensive hard to come by and they had they had to do with what they had rice correct kill there were words like aloof\nWhich could have been which A L F aloof which could have been pronounced the number of different ways and could have meant something very different than ours and equipment\nBattalions or groups are clusters so the likely scenario is that they weren't two million ... Israel lights crossing but more like fifty thousand and then if you read closely all of the other counts\nIn the Bible right the number first born which is two hundred and Seventy three groups that are put aside and you look at the lines to make sacrifices that are much more comports with fifty thousand yelled into it and you're not always going to come up where you want to buy that I Want to come out and say oh it's six hundred thousand\nWell right you know you have to follow the road and let you take let it take you wear a tale\nYour vast rash of me that that we have this up to a gym and we have the ... gate\nEh but you're going right back to the Hebrew and you're saying that no we don't know it's not playing it's not clear it could be this or it could be this\nAnd uh it bears looking into and maybe the answer is we don't know but here's some Spaniards impossibility I Love that because again you're taking it seriously you're not saying saying no this is what they've always said and it's got to be this and you know and and I really think that\nThe Bible can hold up to that kind of scrutiny that there are a lot of people that are told like no don't look too closely on the country look as closely as he like if this is the word of God\nYou can look as closely as you like you learn something that you didn't see before\nYou must I mean I'd rather talk with someone who is questioning and its will and it's open right I mean some people are closed I've I've encountered atheist and all candor when I talk to them and if I start to give them one of the bluebird said you're

you're from Manhattan we've got to get you back\nIn here and continue this kind of a conversation because there's so much to dig into I mean when you talk about uh how this Hebrew word might be that word of that word it's a funny thing\nBecause when when you think about Hebrew being written without vowels I mean a lot of people think what no vowels how does that work and I think the same is true of many ancient languages I I've been studying Homer a\nAnd the odyssey and and you realize that this may have been written in linear be right another was ... was the language of the ... it was a ... big language and you can to all these\nUh I really think delightful battles in conversations about\nWhat this word might have been in that word my it's really delightful to get into that and so but you so you've done a really deep dive here into the Bible at what point did you did you say to yourself I Know that this is that this is real that this is true that that that this these books are\nThank you for having me well listen there's so much to talk about but but maybe we can start with um this past got Thomas Case ah I just last week a mentioned that on the air uh for for those who aren't familiar with this please tell us what is going on this is a huge case right now\nYeah absolutely so ... Thomas is a mother and Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly\nAssaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy that had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said boys who identify as the girls\nAre allowed to use the girls facilities and so as a result of this very bad policy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show what we've been talking about what the dangers of\nAdopting these policies that have schools allowing students to to use the restrooms are the opposite sex\nWell I don't really understand how can a little kid identify as gender fluid I haven't my notes here that in in Decatur, Georgia at the ... elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid a entered\nThe girl's room\nAnd somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean ... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah that the school district policy made this possible it was a pass sort of under the cover of darkness of about two years ago and it said we're going to allow students to make their own determination of whether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect\nThe desires of the child in the ... in this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this as ... as ... daughter was using the restroom ... a young boy that identifies as gender fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her in a in a sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade a posh his daughter and so given a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but what the the bigger problem is the school enabling dissemble\nWho but his release in ... who identified him as gender fluid that's just insanity what is that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nYeah that I think that's part of what the investigation that the department of education is launching is looking into but\nUnder the school policies and indicators unfortunately not alone in this but it it really is determined by the child and so if a child walks in and says this is what I Am or this is how I identify today the schools essentially say okay we're not going to question that we're not going to determine\nWhether that there's a better accommodations we can ... that we can offer rather we're just going to let you use whatever\nRestroom or facility you want to regardless of the impact that has on other students\nWell it it's just a stunning thing that it's possible uh for a little girl I'm to be exposed to anything of any kind of a sexual nature\nWhen she just wants to go to the bathroom I mean the fact that because we all know that there are very troubled kids out there we don't know or anything it seems about this boy but the very idea that it's described as something of a sexual nature at this age it's just horrifying but you're telling me that the school\nHad this policy so they could not stop this boy from going into the girl's bathroom\nAnd not only that but after all of this you would think the school might\nReconsider its policy it hasn't done so you would think the school might\nEven to say look maybe we ought to make sure posh\nHis daughter and this boy you're no longer in the same classroom that didn't happen as well at left Pasha with the only option of taking her daughter out of that school something any parent would do when the school was so unresponsive to what happened here and that just shows that this is this is not about you know trying to keep the students interest first but it's about the school\nStanding by as a very dangerous unsafe policy even in light of evidence of harm it resulted in to pass his daughter well\nI think what you see happening over and over men is that people have no courage when it comes to these kinds of cultural issues in other words everybody knows right now the easy thing to do is to go along with the sort of you know transgender trend and if you bucket people are going to say well are you are you a big it\nAnd so typically people in authority school authorities people in corporations they have very little courage in other words they just want to do whatever they need to do to not get in trouble and in this case who's going to suffer the kids so so they're not doing their job\nHum and they're forcing this mother to take her little girl out of the school because they refuse to do their job I mean that strikes me as a what is happening here\nYeah that's exactly right in the school has a lot of options that it could have offered to this young boy a dove given him a single user restroom that he has access to\nBut what it should never do adopt a broad sweeping policy that says use whatever restroom you want go in there with a little girls are in there and that is the danger of these policies as for other than taking a stand and say no we're not going to compromise the privacy and safety of our other students were going to find solutions but we're not going to do it at the expense of everyone else\nThey took the route to say no let's just adopt is brought sleeping policy let's not have the courage to take a stand and say is is really best for all of our students\nAnd we're not going to do anything to compromise the safety of ... shows daughter and others like her\nI I didn't think when I when I grew up a there we would be in a world that is in some ways a crazy that this is craziness when you when you cannot uh have a common sense to say that a five year old\nShould not be given the option to identify as anything other than what he is which is a little boy the idea that this kid is gender food I mean the question is did a doctor say that he needs to be treated this way did his parents say it we don't really have those facts but the idea that\nThe schools are so afraid\nOf doing something wrong that they are allowing this to go on it really is a kind of madness I think we have to call it\nWhat it is it's a kind of madness a but it has to do with religious liberty in this case because ah\nAs length defending freedom has said over and over and over are the people who believe that the men are men and women are women were were were being treated like where this crazy minority when most Americans understand these ideas but these transgender\nTwins have just been pushed on us and here you have a case where\nA this woman pass the time is a is is not being treated right now ... what are you and what is the ATF looking for in this case because you said that this woman I'm a I mean who who is suing whom and what are the details of that suit\nAs things stand right now we we had worked with Pasha to file a complaint with the federal government with the department of education office of civil rights\nAnd we were encouraged to see that the federal government is taking a look at this and launching an investigation into the school district because their concern is not only is you know this is a a dangerous policy but they the school district may have violated federal law\nBy adopting this policy not responding appropriately to to what happened in creating a hostile environment for policy has a daughter and and other young girls that the school so that's a bright light and all of this is that we now have a federal government that's taking these issues seriously and so we're going to continue to work throughout that investigatory process\nUh but at the end of the day what we're wanting is a good policy in place when that ensures something like this doesn't happen\nOne that ensures that girls showers locker rooms and restaurants are reserved for girls ... and the young men and boys don't have access to them\nHang on one second folks are going to be right back oh we're talking with the alliance defending

described I mean nobody is standing up for her and the whole school system is telling her and you can go jumping a lake Pasha Thomas like we we don't we don't really care what happened to you I mean that's effectively where we are\nYeah and it is tragic because there are victims of these dangerous government policies you've been talking about and now we've uh you know seen this happen to a young five year old girl as a result of this this was avoidable\nHad the school district recognize the dangers of this policy had there been people in the school board's saying wait a second should we be adopting this policy um but it's taken courageous ... people like Pasha and her daughter to take a stand and say we're not going to be silent on this we're going to take a stand for our rights because it impacts not just posh\nAnd her daughter not just even the kids in the cater but across the country as more and more school districts are adopting these dangerous policies\nWell I also just want to

that it could be so much worse than what's been described here I mean here you have a five year old and a five or six year old\nBut a little boys can be strong but the point is once you talk about
