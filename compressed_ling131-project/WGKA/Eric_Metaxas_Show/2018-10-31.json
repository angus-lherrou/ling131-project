highlight that\nMainstream media ABC NBC CBS network that's mainstream cable networks I don't consider cable networks mainstream their cable networks\nBut mainstream network press is just that that's the way they liked to view themselves and we will continue to hammer them and expose them for what they aren't as anything but mainstream remember don't forget\nThey're the ones that hey you you are

Minnesota Star Tribune sun country airlines pilot arrested with loaded gun at Florida airport is Minnesota permit to carry not recognized\nYou know why it's not recognized because Minnesota doesn't recognize Florida's permit how do I know that because I have a Florida and uh Georgia permit which Minnesota doesn't recognize\nSo guess what we don't recognize you I mean this is just insane from the
