the book the ... the reason one of the reasons I Love this book is that it's a bipartisan swamp you have people uh from both sides of the aisle and people from no sides of the aisle or on the cover because you recognize that\nThe people on our side on our side very recently because of the cabinet debacle in some of them rose to the occasion but prior to that\nThey really had not been helping very much and I think that is why we have a populist movement now because the ... if they are also out of touch\nPeople they they have turned you know uh they're lonely eyes to Donald Trump it's an extraordinary irony in our history that this man from queens of who's been a developer who has no a political experience has more political skill and more common sense a document\nThan any of these

you've probably already know him but he has a new book out called ship of fools how selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution Tucker this is um\nI was I was quite serious when I said I have a book out called Donald drain the swamp and it's it's weirdly a similar these as we have a bi partisan swamp you have a bipartisan ship all fools that's very interesting in other words there are people I think all over the map\nPolitically who recognize they are not being represented and it's not just a you know a cave a I'm a forgive me I'm a minor is you know coal miners are bits people all over the spectrum who recognize that they are not being served by the people who are supposed to be\nRepresenting them so it's kind of a it is an historic moment in our history or because we we we very rarely\nHave those kinds of\nMoments where everybody seems to understand that something was wrong ... exactly\nAnd nobody's even now I mean I just sketched out my chauffeur tonight and I'm thinking the ... the obvious question is that one no one addresses so\nLike why are you know half of millennials telling pollsters that they prefer socialism to capitalism [laughter] what's that about yeah and I'll tell you is about it's really simple young people are still mired in debt\nThat they can't get married or buy cars or afford to buy homes it's totally different right economically from the world I grew up then yeah I graduated from college I didn't graduate I just got married in Nineteen Ninety One it wasn't a hundred years ago was the east and I make fourteen grand a year and my wife made and\nAnd we looked fine you know what you mean like I thought I had a shot at doing better than my parents and I did\nWrite you know what I mean and I didn't have any family support I mean you have a single friend who was a child say moving to New York city for a first job who's not being supported by their parents know you have to support your kids when they graduate college 'cause the economy will support them\nWell disaster I yeah I mean that's the ... and nobody says anything about it it's like what I Need all that is why they don't believe in capital is\nActually the ... I Would add to that that the reason a young people\nAre saying that therefore socialism it's pure ignorance in other words you have a in the last forty years we have not been teaching the basic foundational values of what is American self government what is capitalism how these things work if you don't teach these things as good\nA then then people can assume things because they really are blissfully ignorant they don't understand if you've never run a business or you don't understand how bad regulation can be and how bad tax can be if you don't get that stuff and you've not been taught\nThat you are to love these ideas these wonderful American ideas or if you're not taught that\nI I Want to ask you I Am really worried about these gigantic corporations are having what amounts to a monopoly being able to control information in a way that it seems to me the founders did\nNot foresee on any level and\nI'm really concerned for the country or Facebook or an Amazon and Google and all of these companies\nObviously they belong to the end the ship a fool's category they lean very strongly left and they have extraordinary power what do you suppose we can do is there anything we can do about that or what do you think we might do\nI mean these are not American companies goes on merit company it's a multinational huge parts of it are owned by the side of their wealth funds are countries that hate us\nSo there's no there's nothing inherently American about Google you can know it could never have never dropped in any other country their oil to America they have a stranglehold on all information in English\nAnd they could determine the outcome of our elections so why is it will not massive threat it was our company history of the world today don't worry about than the Social Security administration does\nEnter Congress just kind of ignore it and that and the dumb Republican and they really are dumb are still repeating like talking points from the ... Institute circa Nineteen Ninety nine like oh you know the free market which\nIs what is it an ... isn't it a ... well the funny thing too is that one thing that always in rages may about people who think the free market is God\n... if if if we have a truly free market a ... around the globe and their slave labor\nIn another country do I not a moral reason\nTo say the free market can go to hell I Want to buy goods from people that are not in Slade that uh have religious liberty this to me seems more fundamental to me as an American than this idea that a borders\nUh for trade or anything is somehow not conservative I mean\nIt's a it's madness to me so thanks or you know ... it's stupid\nPropaganda that the conservatives including me unfortunately swallowed it never thought about\nWhat you care about the outcome not the ... I don't care what you call your economic system I wanted it with\nMy family has autonomy to worship as we want where my children can be safe at where the family is more important than anything else\nWe live in a system now where you know girls my three daughters are told royals your childhood is their first obligation is to global capitalism and you have an awful it's worth virtually to work at some investment banker to raise your own children I mean maybe that's what you want okay fine\nBut we're telling our kids get their first obligation is to serve shareholders and knocked her\nFamily isn't that amazing who signed up for that but I don't know what we're going to defend it yeah I don't know why\nWell they're not thinking I have to say I mean I've talked about this in the past but their their fundamental things that some of our leaders don't understand I remember you know George\nBush when we had an hour of course I was a fan of Bush I voted for him but but the idea that we can wave a magic wand kill a dictator and you know Seventeen Seventy six style self government and democracy is going to\nPop up in Afghanistan and in Iraq and you think wait a second this is a fundamental misunderstanding of how things are supposed to work you need a people of virtue to govern\nThemselves you need a whole history and the these kinds of things understanding what the free market is and what it is and why it's good and why it's not I really think our leaders we were\nSo um [laughter] no it's true I Know we bought it like now when the non Arabic\nSpeaker like Bill Kristol tells you he knows exactly what's going to happen in the country has never been to you and doesn't understand yeah and we by which are not like oh that's right it's like ... I Believe it's like you know what's going to happen like life is so complex right every\nWar has we're still dealing with the outcome of the first war are you joking I mean like\nThis is ... I don't know whatever we were very unwise yeah into believing a lot of dumb people who pretended to know what they were talking about but had no idea\nI I mean I I I hate to agree I hate to agree and you're ... you're exactly right but listen we're coming to see these things now at least you are and I am and we can see there's a couple of other people out there who see these things\nAnd uh I really think that a lot of this has coalesced around the personal person in the presidency of Donald\nTrump and we're really are having a a realignment or a market correction of ideas as it were we're out\nOf time I know you have to go maybe you can stay on the line I Want to get your address to send you might Donald drain the swamp book and shame on you ... for not telling Tucker Carlson about
