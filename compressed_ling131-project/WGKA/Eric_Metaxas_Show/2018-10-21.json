in her fifties and widowed\nI'm living with my character and just starting her life over for the first time and killing on a dating app and then you have my younger sister again that are twenty and she's the millennial\nKind of living by ... you know she got married for thirty has a kid but now it's sort of feeling like that seven year itch and her marriage and getting a little bit bored wondering if she made the right decisions and it's living vicariously to our character that we're having fun\nSo tell us about your character Olivia what kind of person who she\nTight in the beginning she works in insurance is doing really well\nI'm without a relationship for the last few years she had a five year why not you know after she got out he just went dove into her work and didn't date and had done really well and so now she's starting her sister talks are into getting on tinder after she goes to the gynecologist ... played by Jason today could where he tells her that\nAt thirty five basically you're starting to dry out and if they ever want to have a kid there anything you'd better you know like he kinda got to get started on at least dating um which is a lot of things I think that women here in the thirties and there are there other on tender and I'm here today I'll let her ... and you'll see her kind of start opening up throughout the\nAnd becoming a different person away all of them have big ark\nWell she has two hundred and fifty two matches so yeah since Olivia do is kind of doing the ultimate in speed dating or are you assume that not every day there's a home run is how is that the case\nAnd also she's not always the home run you know what I mean like I feel like that's a big part of dating in Iowa in the ... you know that like drink too much or I was the one that was a very and the date sometimes it\nRight in the first episode you'll see that she's the one that's the the math\nUm and it's not a date of the week shows the it's not like you'll see a different date every week and then you know we're going to go on to interrupt you episodes it's really not that it's just a jumping off point of the show but the show is really a grounded it's about life more than it is about just tender dating and these relationships between the mom and a sister\nUm that I think a lot of people will find relate a ball and a lot of it's based on my own experiences in life whether it be with dating or just embarrassing things like the gynecologist office that seen happen to me I'm so you'll see a lot of that stuff about to life where it's kind of cringe worthy comedy sometimes [laughter] but I Love to watch\nSo when do you think that many matches with Olivia learned about human beings and what does she perhaps learn about them so\nYeah I mean that's that's really the message is is\nYou know she's not at the end of the day she's not out looking for\nMr Right to save the day and come in and you know live happily ever after\nI'd like to get the message across that you know you're going to give you an experience all these things in life but really most important thing is she's figuring out who she is and what she loves and if somebody gets into that part you know naturally than great but it's these three women kind of figuring out who they are at the later stages in life\nUm and and how important that is\nAnd how much it affects you if you bring somebody in and get married and make that everything to you what happened is like right on and when her husband dies she left with nothing you know she has no skills you've never had a job and she has to come up with my character\nAnd I and so a big part of it is just you know as women I think we're we're taught as kids like the prince had to live happily ever after and you find your prints and all that stuff and it's just it's so much more about know figure out who you are you know do your thing they got what makes you happy and if somebody fits into that great\nYou know you mentioned the ... mom Mary she's old dating yeah\nPlay by rather than our cat is amazing\nThe fact that the ... or something in common is that India does that enhanced the relationship that they become closer his mother and daughter\nIn certain ways that dies in certain ways that it it you know a makes it worse because of your mom and dating and she's living with her and her she's a little bit like a teenager you know what I mean she's like I said you've never had a job as you're going to see her\nGet a job for a first time like figure out what it's like to be independent and Olivia their role to reverse where Olivia is more like the mom and she's like the kid\nSo and how that affects the way they are when she really just need the mom you know\nLike it it it sort of based on like when my mom was single in her fifties they're very different my mom's very independent but the idea that um that that when you're when she's doing that and I kind of become your friend as opposed to your mom and how that affects the relationship I always found that really interesting and I bring that into their relationship\nTo you mentioned rows and rows of course is your ... was it like working with her\nIt was really fun I mean she's a proud she's been doing this forever and she's so good\nAnd honestly was perfect for the role like as soon as her name was brought up everybody we were just trying to think who would who would be good for this role you know somebody in their fifties and bodies all of these\nCharacteristics are going to be at least play them and she was she was dead on and when we met her\nShe just was game to do anything so that was awesome and and had her own ideas I wanted to bring menopause into this world you know what I mean like what it's like to be going through menopause and I found that really funny and interesting and sad\nI'm so she was great I mean the fact that he was gay to do everything it's a very vulnerable role that I think a lot of actresses would have trouble playing that she took on and did have challenges but but handled them really well and I think nailed it in the end\nRight now you mentioned that size what is at least partially autobiographical so humbled Cuba Libya is truly you\nKnow it's it's it's based on parts of me you know but it's not it's not like it's definitely not an autobiography it's not I'm not just like\nPlaying myself exactly there's a lot of things about her that maybe are things that I went through before that she still having to go through or they're loosely based on even like other people that I Know that I'll bring into the character but I always at the core of it almost every character I write has a piece of me and them\nUm so so there's that but it's definitely not an autobiography um I don't I you know I'm not\nAs uptight as her and closed minded as she is you know there are there are big pieces of of me that are in there for sure\nWho personally when it comes online dating your view what are some of the positives one and we'll just some of the negatives\nWell negatives I think it's you know there's a lot there's a lot of choice and I think it makes it more people\nWill you know like if it makes it hard people to settle down like they do like somebody and then they'll be like but what else is out there because there is something else out there you know there's a little you can go home and and go to bed and get your phone out and start swiping and more people and have two more days the next day if you want\nSo I think that that can be a little bit of a negative it help it it it makes it where people it's hard to connect I mean that that that in the show it's easy to match hard to connect that and that's a big problem but positives are I went on there\nRight people don't realize that one day people will be studying us and we'll be the one that's\nRight and you know we think the way that you know the forefront of a mountain seem like they should get day [laughter] you can't judge people by off on that side that I\nThink you know you have to pay people in that time to understand why they why they ... they ... they said oh did what they did but like I said everybody has to eight everybody had a family everybody was worried about you know standing in line\nAt the same major concerns me away as humid\nAnd Andrew working people find out more about secrets on line\n[noise] well Smithsonian Charles how are you can go to our website that should tell 'em oh just wish I had a more power to the previous segment as well because of that but
