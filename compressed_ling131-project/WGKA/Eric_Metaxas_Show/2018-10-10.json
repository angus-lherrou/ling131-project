remember what I just told you take a listen to a couple of questions he asks before I go to the Senate pages themselves why does a fascist left feel entitled to engage in addition slander stocking and violence to pursue it then\nI think about this for a second because he says they feel entitled in the insane\nProgressive whistle world of the self anointed social injustice warriors\nWere words that challenge their dogs are deemed violent they feel entitled indeed compelled to attack all dissenters in self defense the\nNo fired hair salon style as progressive loser who kicked the woman roundhouse character did so in self defense because he didn't like what she said about what he deems what\n\nThe rule of law upsets you can't disagree with me on that if you do it's violence against me and I can defend myself that's the way these lunatics fake\n\nAnd he says that the left has to answer a question very soon in the wake of the Kavanaugh hearings because it is their lawlessness exacerbating the political divide and deepening America's called civil war let's go to the U.S Senate\nAnd you know who Charles Sumner is history lesson for the day I'm going to take you back to may Nineteen Eighteen fifty six crime against Kansas that's right Kansas you're listening\nThe Wichita big talkers tuned into this it got really hot and the old Senate chamber back on may nineteenth and Eighteen fifty six in fact it was about Ninety degrees when a Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner rose up to speak\nIt took him two months at that time schedule for time and he had written\nA one hundred and twelve page long we'll call it an address and he titled it the crime against Kansas there was an explosive debate going on on the floor of a set it in the house at that time as to whether or not Kansas should be admitted to the union as either a slave state or free state\nThis guy's Sumner brilliant memorized every single one hundred word of that one hundred and twelve page document he wrote and it took him four and a half hours to address it\nCan be cited\nAnd according to the Senate zone page from the U.S Senate Senate dot Gov\nAdopting a matter of a classical scholar lecturing slow with a children's ... spoke for five hours over two days he singled out two Democratic senators that's principal culprits in this crime against Kansas that supporters of slavery had perpetrated against Kansas in the nation's democratic institutions\nFirst with Stephen Douglas he was from Illinois\nLast summer you got to remember he was a member of the new and emerging Republican Party\nAnd privately according to the Senate paid considered this leader of the Senate Democrats are brutal quote brutal vulgar man without delicacy or scholarship who looks as if he needs to clean linen and should be put under a shower bath\nThose are his own words turning to Douglas ... described him as a quote turning to him\nDescribed him on the floor of a set of as a quote noise some squat and name was animal not proper model for an American senator\nThen you know with some or did he turned his attention toward Andrew Butler senator who was not present that day one of the few senators who was not present that day and he mocked\nThe south Carolina Senator stance as a man of chivalry the Massachusetts senator charged him with taking quote a mystery sue the ugly to others is always lovely to him\nSo polluted in the side of the world in faced in his site I mean\nThe harlot slavery\nNow two days later something astonishing what happened\nOn may twenty second Eighteen fifty six in what is obviously referred to as the world's greatest deliberative body guess what happened\nAnd I'll quote from the page for you in one of the most dramatic and deeply ominous moments in the Senate's entire history\nA member of the house of representatives entered the Senate chamber and savagely beat a senator into unconscious Elvis you may remember from your history books not from today they will never tell you this today\nThose of you who are old enough they remember their says the gaining of Senator Charles Sumner\nThat we should have again this is the U.S Senate We're talking about not some third world banana republic\nOver Eighteen fifty six they weren't really modern people that if you think like that you're just an idiot turn that dial\nThe inspiration for the painting of Charles summer came three days before and what I just told you when Massachusetts anti slavery Republican address the set it on whether Kansas should be admitted to the union as a slave states were free straight free state and the crime against Kansas speech\nHe identified as I told you Stephen Douglas and Andrew Butler South Carolina he characterize them as nameless faceless animals basically he mocked the south Carolina Senator\nMel Brooks yet this\nRepresentative press and Bruce was Butler's South Carolina relatively relative there were ... they're related\nHe took a cane with a metal top on it\nAnd summer was sitting there signing some post to cop for copies of the speech\nWhen Brooks walked up to him and just beat the living hell out of him over the head with the came knocking him essentially unconscious blinded him momentarily to the point that some day or couldn't see stumble around the floor of the Senate\nAnd this went on oh I think for about four to five minutes\nHe usually attempted to protect himself\nQuoting from the Senate bleeding profusely summer was carried away Brooks walked calmly out of the chamber\nDemocrats\nWent out being detained by the ... workers overnight both men became heroes and their respective region get get what happened to him he survived house censure resolution\nBut he resigned and he said he left the people decide whether he should go back he was reelected we're talking about books the man who Cain nearly to death\nSumner\nWhen he later died in Eighteen thirty seven I think from Thai food or something goofy like that type of is I forget what it was\nWell someday recovered slowly and return to the Senate he remained in the Senate for Eighteen more years\nWhy do I tell you the story I'll tell you why\nBecause at the end of the American greatness speaks loves they've been the best for less Thaddeus McCotter said this in the wake of the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings the increasing the question the only left can answer because it's their lawlessness exacerbating the political divide and deepening America's cold civil war\nBest left pondering devise an answer soon if they do not one day historians will record that the violent or had turned Steve's beliefs into our Charles Sumner now from the pages of the U.S Senate\nTo match sharp is the senior counsel and director of the center for legislative advocacy at the alliance defending freedom and he's on the line right now that Trump welcome\nThank you for having me\nWell listen there's so much to talk about but but maybe we can start with um this past got Thomas Case ah I just last week a mentioned that on the air uh for for those who aren't familiar with this please tell us what is going on this is a huge case right now\nYeah absolutely so ... is a mother in Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly\nAssaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy that had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said boys who identify as girls\nAre allowed to use the girls facilities and so as a result of this very bad policy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show what we've been talking about what the dangers of\nAdopting these policies and schools allowing students to to use the restrooms of the opposite sex\nWell I don't really understand how can a little kid identify as gender fluid I haven't my notes here that in in Decatur, Georgia at the ... elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid a entered\nThe girl's room and somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean ... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah the the school district policy made this possible it was a pass sort of under the cover of darkness oh about two years ago and it's sad\nYou're going to allow students to make their own determination of whether they're\nA transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect the desires of the child in the ...\nIn this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this as Pashtuns daughter was using the restroom that's a young boy that identifies the gender fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did a muscle tour in a in a sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade a posh his daughter and so given a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but what the the bigger problem is the school and a blend assemble\nWho buddies release in ... who identified him as gender fluid that's just insanity what does that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nYeah that I think that's part of what the investigation that the department of education is launching is looking into but under the school policies in indicators unfortunately not alone in this but it it really is determined by the child and so if a child walks in and says this is what I Am or this is how I identify today these schools essentially say okay\nWe're not going to question that we're not going to determine whether that there's a better accommodations we can\nThat we can offer rather we're just going to let you use whatever\nRestroom or facility you want to regardless of the impact it has another students\nWell it it's just a stunning thing that it's possible for a little girl I'm to be exposed to anything of any kind of a sexual nature\nWhen she just wants to go to the bathroom I mean the fact that because we all know that there are very troubled kids out there we don't know or anything it seems about this boy but the very idea that is described as something of a sexual nature at this age it's just horrifying but you're telling me that the school\nHad this policy so they could not stop this boy from going into the girl's bathroom\n[noise] not only that but after all of this you would think the school might reconsider its policy it hasn't done so you would think the school might\nEven just say look maybe we ought to make sure posh\nHis daughter and this boy you're no longer in the same classroom that didn't happen as well it left Pasha with the only option of taking her daughter out of that school something any parent would do when the school was so unresponsive to what happened here and that just shows that this is this is not about you know trying to keep the students interest\nFirst what it's about the school\nStanding by a very dangerous unsafe policy even in light of evidence of harm it resulted in to pass his daughter\nWell I I think what you see happening over and over ... is that people have no courage when it comes to these kinds of cultural issues in other words everybody knows right now the easy thing to do is to go along with the sort of you know transgender trend and if you bucket people are going to say what are you are you a big it\nAnd so typically people in authority school authorities people in corporations\nThey have very little courage in other words they just want to do whatever they need to do to not get in trouble and in this case who's going to suffer the kids so so they're not doing their job and they're forcing this mother to take her little girl out of the school because they refused to do their job I mean that strikes me as a what is happening here\nYeah that's exactly right you know the school had a lot of options that it could have offered to this young boy a dove\nGiving him a single use the restroom that he has access to but what it should never do adopt\nA broad sweeping policy that says use whatever restroom you want to go in there when little girls around there and that is the danger of these policies is rather than taking a stand and say no we're not going to compromise the privacy and safety of our other students were going to find solutions but we're not going to do it at the expense of everyone else\nThey took the roof to say no let's just adopt is broad sweeping policy let's not have the courage to take a stand and say is is really best for all of our students\nAnd we're not going to do anything to compromise the safety of pastas daughter and others like her\nI I didn't think when I when I grew up there we would be in a world that is in some ways a crazy that this is craziness when you when you cannot\nUh have a common sense to say that a five year old\nShould not be given the option to identify as in anything other than what he is which is a little boy the idea that this kid a gender food I mean the question is did a doctor say that he needs to be treated this way did his parents say it we don't really have those facts but the idea that\nThe schools are so afraid of doing something wrong that they are allowing this to go on it really is a kind of madness I think we have to call it\nWhat it is it's a kind of madness a but it has to do with religious liberty in this case because ah as ... defending freedom has\nSaid over and over and over uh the people who believe that the men are men and women are women were were were being treated like where this crazy minority when most Americans understand these ideas but these transgender twins have just been pushed on us and here you have a case where\nA this woman passion Thomas ah is is not being treated right now ... ... what are you in what is the ATF looking for in this case because he said that this woman\nI'm a I mean who who is suing whom and what are the details of that suit\nAs things stand right now we we had worked with posture to file a complaint with the federal government with the department of education office of civil rights and we were encouraged to see that the federal government is taking a look at this and launching an investigation into the school district because their concern is not only is you know this is a\nDangerous policy but they the school district may have violated federal law\nBy adopting this policy not responding appropriately to to what happened in and creating a hostile environment for posh his daughter and and other young girls at this school so that's a bright light and all of this is that we now have a federal government that's taking these issues seriously and so we're going to continue to work throughout that investigatory process\nUh but at the end of the day what we're wanting is a good policy in place one to ensure something like this doesn't happen when that ensures that girls showers locker rooms and restrooms are reserved for girls ... and the young men and boys don't have access to them\nHang on one second folks are going to be right back oh we're talking with the alliance defending freedom is Matt Sharp on the ... show\nAnd I try to answer\nPay their it's aired ma taxes for policy genius here's an on fun fact over half of bankruptcies and mortgage foreclosures are caused by medical issues that's because if you get sick or injured over the course of your career your employer sick leave off and only covers ... up to three months and while health insurance helped with medical bills he doesn't replace lost income that\nIs where disability insurance comes in it's essentially income insurance to protect your paycheck if you're sidelined by an illness were injury\nPolicy genius does all the shopping for you they compare quotes from the top disability insurance companies to find the best price then their license experts manage the application process to say you timed and hassle\nPolicy genius has helped over four

you protect your paycheck at a price that makes sense you can get started on line right now the policy genius the easy way to compare and by disability insurance [noise]\nWas shocking to me that the government would try to take away my freedoms\nFor my\nThat's jak Philips a masterpiece cake shop in Colorado who was sued for living out his religious beliefs\nDefending freedom took his case all the

there\nWhere there's a phone number I'm now ... you know I I just want to say that a few years ago I Would hear people bring up cases like this like the case of of jak Philips\nAnd are kind of roll my eyes and say you know the people always they're always complaining about these these uh these fringe these crazy stories and and the time has passed and I think to myself you know I'm I've met jak Philips I've met a\nWho was the other the the the bakers of photographers who ... practically lost their business because all they did was say\nWe're Christians we cannot participate in a same sex a wedding ceremony it goes against our values against our religion and those people are told hey shut up\nDo as you're told or we will sue your rear end you know all the way back to zero you will lose everything now\nWhen I when I really understand this I think this is the definition of an American in America you're\nSupposed to have choices and right now people like that are being told you better do this or you lose everything now I Want to go back to Chuck Philips a tell us the story about jak Philips and then I Want to talk about the new case to check Philips has\nSo jak Philips has a cake artist and does incredible designs\nOn a variety of things but he's always operated consistent with certain views certain cakes he won't design and he won't use utilize its artistic talent sworn to things like I'm celebrating Halloween that he doesn't like the you know devil imagery and all of that stuff or\nA cakes that are a integrating the American flag or or mocking any group of people well he was approached by a couple that asked him to do a cake celebrating their same sex\nUnion and jak politely declined and said you know I I Can't use my artistic designed to to create a cake that celebrate something that I think violates\nGod's plans for marriage and as a result he was sued by\nThis couple and the state of Colorado a and fought all the way to the Supreme Court losing it every step of the way and we were able to represent them free of charge and gets to the U.S Supreme Court in the Supreme Court says no Colorado you cannot have hostility towards ... beliefs\nHe's entitled to those and you're a efforts to to denigrate those and punish him for those is unacceptable and said that's where it ended up that we thought was the end of the story was that Jack was going to be indicated in his right to work and create are consistent with his beliefs\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with when the civil rights commission that had just lost at the Supreme Court\nMused jacks\nCase against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case\nTo find probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this commission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his beliefs this isn't about letting him\nContinue to operate as a business and serve every body but give him the freedom to decline certain cakes this is saying we hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that uh your average American really would rather ignore this kind of stuff that I'm telling you folks ah one we're fighting a civil war when we were finding the revolution there always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight\nA and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is a battle for everybody this is not us against them God Forbid uh the people on the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away with this kind of\nDeeply cynical behavior\nToward their fellow Americans is it's just not right and but we have to stand up so the least we can do as I said his vote a please vote folks and what your values are get serious don't don't uh\nDon't as so many people have such excuses please or if you don't vote don't ever complain again\nA and I want to say uh if you can give to the alliance defending freedom I don't know\nAnybody that is doing this kind\nOf work right now so I Want to say go to ... dot com you'll see the banner every penny you get will be doubled up please give what you can\nAnd this is that folks this is why God gives us money an energy is is to use them for his purposes and right now I'm this is something that's about all we need to fight it it's tremendous because they will come for you eventually you know of everybody just looks the other way uh eventually\nThey're going to come for you and you're going to ask you to do something that violates your values are you going to say uh where do I turn well uh I like to think you could turn the lights defending freedom so the number in case you don't have a\nA website you can go to my taxes talked dot com it that difficult or you can call one eight hundred\nFive five six twenty seven Seventy one eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy one eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy a mat sharp uh what else are we looking at what other cases are out there right now because this seems to be never ending\nThat's right I think one of the other big issues we've been working on dealing with a adoption and foster care providers so we have a a crisis in our country with a four hundred thousand kids in the adoption foster care system about a hundred thousand kids\nAre eligible for adoption and we need\nOrganizations out there recruiting families training them helping to connect kids with forever homes but the same uh effort to\nPunish faith based organizations just to the same hostility we solve towards the jak we're now seeing towards these agencies fits in Philadelphia in Massachusetts in Illinois and other places faith based agencies have been shut down\nRun out of business simply because they want to operate\nConsistent with their view about the best environment to raise a kid that every child deserves a mother and a father and so at the same time for example in Philadelphia that the city was saying we desperately need more foster care parents are just a few days later they were shutting down a Catholic social services because\nThey didn't like Catholic social services views about marriage and this again shows this ongoing hostility and the impact it's having on kids that they're being\nDenied of organizations out there working to find them homes they're being denied of these families that would have been recruited all because this effort to push an ideology in for the government to punish those that don't like that they don't like their beliefs\nI have to say if this doesn't make you mad folks if this doesn't make you mad I I just assume\nYou're not listening because this is horrendous and the only good news and that's why I'm here folks I'm not here to complain is to say you can do something about it one of the things you can do and I hope you will do is give to the alliance defending\nFreedom it doesn't matter what you give give something we've got to help them do what they do or you can go to the website ... attacks us talk dot com you can see the

you have a value of let's call it a religious value that that you say I I feel uncomfortable with this right feel uncomfortable with that\nThe government is increasingly saying oh we don't really care how you feel about your little religion shut up and do X Y or Z now I got to say any I states of America\nSo what's gonna happen is they're gonna have to do a second printing and that will be less valuable that some warning my friends are worn Jew fears I warned you okay uh I got him as a couple of things first of all we just did a hour one with Matt Sharp the lines defending freedom we're doing a fundraiser for the alliance defending freedom I always say I'm you've got to act\nIt's it's not enough to pray or to hope you have to do those things\nAnd you have to act and acting means you know\nA glorifying God with your with your whole life with how you spend your time with how you think would how you spend your money with how you treat people with whatever it is and I\nI we make an effort to have organizations on this program whether it's I guess on this program or things are raising money for that we believe in deeply\nAlliance defending freedom\nIs at the top of the list why because religious liberty has been under attack for a while in this country and it is very serious I said in his folks\nI I remember hearing people say this like ten years ago Fifteen Years ago chuckles when talking about a nickel now you know there's these Christians always kind of talking about this and I've come to the conclusion unfortunately and I send fortunately disturbing that they were right that if we do not fight for these things that we believe in\nUh we are going to lose what we have the freedoms in America okay so religious liberty you are right to believe what you believe and to act on it or to not do something because of your faith\nUm it it's under attack and ATF lines defending freedom they're standing up for it so um anyway let me just to be specific ah America's\nHundred and fourteen I think Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in um ... last night uh okay uh and he's going to start work today which is kind of freaky right they're gonna they're going to work today and he's on the okay now alliance defending freedom this is the these are the folks that we're\nTalking about and we just talk to 'em one of their lead guys met sharp in our one\nAbout transgender and all this different stuff they won a seven to two decision from the Supreme Court just this past June okay defending the man that we were talking about in the last hour Colorado bigger jak Philips a firm actions by the Colorado civil rights commission and these people are unhinged\nLunatics I mean I have to say what they did it really it's disturbing and the more you know about it the more I'm just telling you folks that you have to you have to fight because these people are enhanced\nSo they so the Supreme Court ... uh gave a seven to decision thanks to alliance defending freedom this is my point aligned summoning freedom for free argued on behalf of jak\nPhilips is something that shouldn't even have to go to court it's insane but despite the ruling okay the same agency okay the people I've just said er and hinged they have again targeted jak\nPhilips and we talked about in the last hour but I Want you to hear an ATF has a lawyer and there's a there's a clip here we go\nHe's back in it all over again and so ADS on behalf of Mr Philips has not only helping him defend that action\nBut as also filed affirmatively inaction in Colorado federal court saying that these violations of his religious free exercise rights need to be stopped a right at the courthouse state so that he doesn't continue to be persecuted [noise]\nSo to think about that thinking about this and and we discussed it in the last hour I don't want to vote labor it but it's it's lunacy\nAnd you can't just say oh it's lunacy you have to you have to fight the lunacy otherwise Lucy is taking over so\nUm anyway the alliance defending freedom they are in fact second to none in defending religious liberty including arguing in winning cases before the Supreme Court and they just said\nBut they do this for free it costs a lot of money so you my listeners can help right now\nWith a gift to alliance defending freedom so we've been told that there's a matching grant that they have not raise the full matching grant so it still means that every\nPenny you give is doubled so you have to go to ... attacks us talk dot com that's our website and there's a lot of other reasons to go to the website check it out in the taxes talk dot com but if you go there you'll see the banner a and it says I wanted to fend religious freedom I I mean it that if we\nWho have the ability we have the money we have the freedom\nA we have the will if we don't do something about these kinds of things and take it seriously the other side takes this very seriously they want to crush religious liberty and you have to understand they think they're doing good\nOkay if it's one thing and say all these people are idiots they ... they think they're doing good they actually think they're fighting bigotry and if you thought you were fighting bigotry\nYou would fight hard and they think they're right now you know again they're not getting it right I don't have time to get into that but I'm saying that alliance offending freedom of these people are heroes these are good people they are doing this for free they need our\nWhy they came to us on this program so we're asking you

Milwaukee Fifteen Years ago one school the Bradley Foundation gave us a grant\nTo go into one school if you have a group of ... or let's say a thousand students they're controlled\nBy ten percent and that ten percent ten percent\nSo if you so if you could use we put about age youth advisor young adults from the community many of them have dropped out of those same schools they have been transformed and they are moral mentors and character coaches so they they spent two weeks to identify who the shot callers that people who is this\nThis is really funny this is a movie by you understand somebody needs to make a movie about this and this is real\nAnd so what happens if you're done if I met ten percent of a cohort and then you reach out to them and and you give them a respectful way to be peaceful and uh and then they influence the other\nA Ninety percent and that's why we're\nAble to go into a school most dangerous schools we only went into one and the principal said\nUh I'm not getting reports from teachers or something we what do we call it climate survey we as teachers to do you feel safer than the principal and the superintendent says hey the police are not getting calls to the school every so we did this one school\nThen we ... we went to a second we created a demand for it then the principal said and the super than they can you do this to six schools so now we're going Fifteen and his Fifteen Years now we have been but there is a Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nThere's the dramatic business dramatic wonderful stuff I Want to keep talking to you and

in an article not very long ago\nA ... year anniversary of the horror of what happened in Charlottesville\nA little bit over a year ago or I Want to talk to you about a little bit about that I where was that published\nThis was in the hill are saying okay 'cause they tell us about what you're saying that article what I said in his article it was about the so called social justice warriors tearing down the statue of a\nOf a civil war a character just happened just happened and they tore down into police stood by and they thought they were a virtue are posturing for the country and so I wrote an article saying as a civil rights veteran I Am against\nA on ought to be opposed to taking down those symbols those channels we first of all it's a waste of time it's it's a distraction if symbols were related to substance than the safest places in America should be Martin Luther king boulevard\nBut it isn't the most dangerous places so I\nI think that is it because symbols are important for us to just because you want to remember something doesn't mean you're in racing and celebrating at the very fact that the choose one is the Holocaust museum so that people would not remember\nAnd as I said in the column and the Christian cross we don't look at it and think about the oppression of Romans we\nBet because the story of the cross is the resurrection are and so that's how we are too but if we don't have\nThese symbols around and we will forget and so I just think that it's a it's a distraction for people on the left to a as an act of a a social justice to take claim to be social justice warriors from taking them down\nAnd when we ought to be taking it does nothing for\nThe thousands of blacks were being killed in the inner city since so because we're taking attention away from those the the real problems facing America and that is\nThe violence the increase in drug addiction opioid overdoses uh there's so many other problems but it's a distraction and it's it's it's cheap posturing\nUh that's going to you that\nYou know when you talk about the posturing I I really feel like the whole\nA race industry today it's become something that I I think to myself I Know many many uh African Americans and I went to college when I went to Yale University and they went to Yale University and they didn't grow up in a working class background\nI grew up in a working class
