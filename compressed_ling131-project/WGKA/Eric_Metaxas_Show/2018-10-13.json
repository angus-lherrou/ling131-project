I didn't even know there was an ex rating or but F ... the difference being the regular half and the effects is that\nIf you're supported by a it was crazy moms against everything in every town for gun safety and and the Bloomberg folks then you get the ax after you're apt to say that uh you know you've been bought so he's he's but he's been bought by the the anti guns\nOr he's running against\nRon dissenters who's a Iraq War vet navy veteran and ah and ah you know is is very very conservative and backed by President Trump so where you know we're hoping things go right to their\nUh the see the next one I got as Mike what about the what's the latest with sixteen thirty nine I sixteen thirty nine out of Washington state\nI Know you've had to mark talk to you about this before I have talked about this a march program I talked about this on my program so we'll give you I I give you the latest I got on on sixteen thirty nine of her folks that they're they're just just tuning in first time sixteen thirty nine as the\nGun control agenda that's that that's going to make\nIts gonna make Washington him more miserable place well listen everything east of Seattle you know or or north of the you know and and south of Seattle is is is is pretty nice well Tacoma I guess so the that Sea Tac area over there as become\nThe new what is a new north ... ah California so they've they've they brought up a lot of those California Rolls Royce of Washington state's beautiful place or you know I'm visual wise and and and uh and law why statute was but\nA sixteen thirty nine is do is to puts an extremely I don't have enough time we only got five minutes left I don't have time to give you a are you know all the sixteen thirty nine would do if a if you're just tuning in\nA in a couple of the easy ones are are are the you know that everybody has got to register guns or you have to put 'em all of your firearms or into the registry you have in this this is done through\nThe sales that can be no more private sales is what sixteen thirty one of the things sixteen thirty one nine once as a um\n... and that's how it's done is every every time you get a gun is sold you have to go through the background check process uh and then that creates a the database there obviously raises the rates to uh to me that age Twenty one years old and the state of Washington to purchase any kind of firearm um\n[noise] it's it's just horrible it's horrible for gun owners in Sacramento supporters and people that believe in you know the constitution and the and in this country but\nThis this uh this bill or is there this proposal that now on the ballot this ballot initiative I had to get the proper number of signatures to get put on the ballot it was done completely\nA half a half baked a you know they they they didn't follow the rules and follow the law or the ... if I recall even the judge that reviewed the case said\nListen the the type fought on here is so small I Can't read and I got twenty twenty vision they didn't follow the proper way of uh of entertaining and documenting what was the new part of the law was the old part of the law so the judge said no it's outta talked about\nThat I think that lasted three days three days and the Washington state Supreme Court said no it's back on we want we want the we want the citizens to decide well obviously you know your which are left leaning a court you want your citizens of this I guess what if it sends a passing out there\nAnd it's challenged again by friends out at the second member foundation or wherever it happens to be you know what those judges are going to say one more time well yeah we know it was bad but you know that's what they want\nSo we're gonna we're gonna let the real at the left habits so\nI'm Glad that you know you're pretty much my my latest updates and a half or there is that uh this is still a a ... um the majority that I I saw somewhere with uh the the law enforcement and so I think was the chief in sheriff's association\nOr that they came out and said they didn't they are against this they're against sixteen thirty nine so so they want to see that they want to see that go on as well\nUm let's see what the\nUh Nike wanted to make your story about a moment or two here I'm In the store yesterday with um my daughter she's a soccer player she needs to get some new sandals slide so the kids go on these days and uh she went over and she let her try him on herself she came and said daddy\nA ... a gangster to okay folks out there that is today friday I Am raising cut again

hip with the kids right now it is incredible I don't know where they came from but they burst onto the scene they became Internet sensations about a year and a half ago\nAnd now they're all over TV and stuff but they are so entertaining so real\nUh I just that's all I'll say you know like do not miss it you know a couple of minutes diamond and silk will be on this program hard to believe that uh that that that we got them but it's only because they got a movie coming out to write a great ... another movie actually it's like one of those ...\nAnd I only found them yet and I think George Clooney is in it and uh now oh now you're you're mistaking this with the oceans forty five or something like that um October Fifteen diamonds silk have their movie coming out and it is called now this is no no lie this is actually the name of that in his\nDummy craps known ... that's not a joke okay hey this is very serious how ... what would George Clooney being a ... called ... everything is a

I'm dummy crafts is is the name of the movie and if it's anything like whatever else diamond in silk have done\nOr you're going to how they are so entertaining some people are just so naturally hilarious even when they're being serious absolutely phenomenal and so in a couple of minutes hold onto your hat local you know you're gonna be a bumpy show 'em\nAnd uh in our two today young other one I mean no no joker like this is straight up like crazy day on the shelves and we have Michael in del now if you don't know who my windows let me just say two words my pillow ...\nFor the best night's sleep and the whole wide world and then my pillow dodged my ring tone now because I like that so well my my pillow is an American story like none other and I may or get him to tell that I Hope again that's an hour to today but he he's a an amazing man\nAnd uh we're going to have him on an hour to uh to tell his story ... ... if you haven't heard a story I don't think you'll believe it I mean I I really know how they're really no it's true because it sounds like it couldn't be true but anyway uh he's ... and I don't know if I mentioned it but he is going to create\nA pillow for my book Donald drain the swamp\nYeah it's going to be it's a pillow they they've done this I think I don't know I looked on his website but he has some paint or something creates pillows and stuff in there the the the take anywhere pillow this is not the big pillow no but it's it can be smaller travel pillows on our couch pillows or whatever you call it any way ah east creating one for Donald drained\nThe swamp and I think it's going to say\nUh he's might have man because Donald is the caveman it's the whole story short Donald a caveman he's my ... but anyway um that that now since this Friday I thought were not doing a fun facts friday but maybe we could do a little fun fact some would that be okay you know sure do do you have any fun facts in front of you know did you give them to me I\nI well we both have it here I Want to share this with the baseball season well it's real winding up of course with the big playoffs the Yankees were in the middle or in the middle of the Yankees were crush yeah yeah at least I got to see my player Andrew McCutcheon I Love him from the pirates naturally but\nI got to seem a little bit who does he play for a place for the Yankees now he had to shave the the the goatee and the the drugs and all that oil because the Yankees have that had a policy but we haven't we established\nIn the Supreme Court establish no that facial hair is free speech you know\nI don't know that when they will probably go for the other way I'm growing a beard right now in ... yeah right now but I'm going to shave it off tomorrow morning but but I'm growing it right now I think just the big state love I think it will come in and sat me hey I don't think so no I found is that I can grow my beard yeah\nBut I found three things about baseball but you're not going to find and other professional for sports like um the football and basketball hockey and all that in the coach in baseball where's the exact same uniform but the players where\nOkay now hold on a second I've never thought of that\nYou're you're telling me that in football no they don't hockey I don't wear a helmet and in ... they don't wear the the baggy shorts OK in football and hockey\nBaskin and basketball the coaches do not dress like a player you know but for some reason and this has never occurred to me I've never thought about this in my life\nFor some reason in baseball the coach dresses like the players such dry and I've never thought of that until just now just because you brought it up brought it up\nAnd here's the question yeah why I don't know isn't that fascinating I Know it is I think it's kind of kind of fun I actually wish this we're calling show because I I Would like to to tell people 'cause somebody out there is going to have ideas on this you know we need to we're going to do more call in shows are most often worry we well we will I'm\nNow in the other thing is in in in baseball that you can only score on off and it's like in football you can intercept the ball and you know in basketball the same thing intercept hockey intercept the puck but you can't in baseball like if the the batter hits a home run in these rounding third the third baseman can't knock them over and then he runs home and scores for the the team\nThat saw not up to bat so you can only score on off and she can't intercept a baseball or [noise]\nOkay so this is another thing about baseball stand alone there's an offense and then you go on defense and then often some defense back and forth\nSo you're telling me so you're telling me that if if I'm In the field ... ... my pictures on the mound my catcher is catching yeah there's no way I can score no no way\nI don't know it's a it's a are you are you sure uh I'm pretty sure isn't it funny because to me baseball something so ingrained that I Can't remember a time when I didn't know how baseball worked you know there's some people they just don't follow sports obviously most Americans don't have baseball works\nBut just hang on okay but these are these are to think that the the scoring thing I guess I don't think that\nIt doesn't seem like a big deal to me but the uniform thing that is just wild I Want to know there's got to be an answer weird that started Mm like if you go back I think I can tell you right now Connie Mack\nNow wait he wasn't the coach he was like the owner right out of the of the of the uh the New York ah ... the New York islanders before they became the Yankees I have to look this up but but I picture Connie Mack wearing a strong voter ... suit\nI I guess I have to think about this for a second was he the owner of the coach I thought it was the coach but you're right if I think if Casey Stengel yeah ... they all ... they all dressed like that so this goes way back but don't you want to know how far back I like to know\nBy the way we didn't get to the third thing yet but we will after your interview we can get through it right now the third thing is in baseball there is spinning spinning the\nChance spit on the floor of the basketball court you can't spin hockey 'cause there'll be bumps on the ice right you can spit in football to wind up on your grid iron right your good work on your hot iron what is it called on the helmet such thing as\nA hawk and okay I think it's called face mask I Need your gridiron the gridiron is the field itself has called the gridiron okay folks that I Know when we come back or by the way that's very valuable fact job and thank\nYou you're well he said sarcastically when we come back diamond and silk [noise] it's crazy now twenty

and just go head to Cade saw so much that they now have someone on the city budget listen on the city payroll to remove\nHuman feces from the streets and sidewalks\nOut a little you can you that and we\nHad the way we were right down there and we\nCouldn't even imagine that when we heard it but what we actually went there and so we we was taken aback by it because we couldn't believe that it was true but it is true you have individuals desiccated there on the streets okay but nobody's doing anything about it they prefer to hire somebody\nTo wash it down the drain instead of trying to figure

most important thing in my life and so to see people have the exuberance the joy that you do and not to not be afraid\nTo speak the truth as you do I I just get great joy now I\nTo ask you before you were doing what you're doing now what were you doing how did you get the idea to do this because it's one thing to use that to to take it public so everybody can enjoy it that to me seems like a tough thing now did you did it so beautiful\nI understand we didn't mean to do it right when we're trying to do something right it would get all the cuts every now and again yes right like they can all I had that I Want my birthday I did not know would add a came when I found out that they had a camera that was all she\nMakes it all came with me and we just got to talk it had no I did all of these people were going we had no idea they were saying things that people show\nPaperwork to say because of the political correct correct and it's meant to make sure we didn't understand what they were talking about what is it political correctness no hitter truth as right we're not talking with Charles Taylor and he\nDidn't know we had ten people on to you too can at the time we was just talking to the people that was there about what we thought about certain subjects or what have it at all and it just snowballs from there it is I I\nI got to say to the the the the thing that you have done that is so powerful is you have given other black Americans of voice because there's so many people in this country think like oh I Can't say that\nAnd they were basically they bully you know you can't have that belief anymore I don't think that's what really outweigh people actually want to cook in a bad people up in a corner\nAnd what they were created a silent majority dry and so when Donald Trump came along it's like oh I I Will give you your voice I'm going to protect religious freedom\nI don't care what anybody do and the ... ability of your home but you can't push stuff up all the people they have their\nBeliefs or their religious convictions those beliefs so that the Democrats did it for the Republican Party [laughter] but yeah he would Hollywood wanted it didn't know what the average Americans want it\nAnd it is because people showed up at the polls we didn't wake up back you know I had all of these people these women market in the streets at these little capsule\nAnd they [laughter] do we\nFought him and if you look it up president have religious faith him he's making sure you have a job he's he's creating the atmosphere or in a good economic opportunity for you if you want to become an entrepreneur you care\nI mean he's got more within the past almost who aired old bottle was able to do an eight year old gay and and what I Love it though I'm not beholden to anyone\nBut the American working with the American people right out the president of the I'm the president of the United states I loved him for that well\nI say it's it's just refreshing to hear you say these things and you know\nI guess what you're talking about with religious freedom and that's one of the biggest issues that I've ever uh talked about on this program and wherever I go giving speeches religious liberty religious freedom has become the issue of our day because it's one of these things that we had so much of it in America nobody really thought about it until more recently suddenly\nYou realize he's under attack people are saying not just we want to live our lives this way but if you do not agree with us we will persecute you we will shut down your businesses and you know ... and others they would have lost their businesses and some of them did\nUh because of this kind of activism and that's on American and so as I say a lot of people have been pushed along with that\nAnd I think many people represented I Know many of my black friends who would have voted Democrat years ago have stopped doing that because the attorney that the Democrats took mainly under Obama we know it would have been worse under Hillary unfortunately\nSo and so here's the sad thing about it you know the same Democrat attacked the Democrat attacked us as being you\nKnow or being used back then the way they mate you made these up here a certain way just listen to how Obama said that the jobs will never come back they're not coming back folks you have to wave a magic wand he wanted to and Dr ... people mind that with that\nSo that when you don't see jobs here then well he said that it wasn't coming back but who who he got bamboo though because president Donald Trump\nShowed you how these jobs can come right back here to America\nAnd what about when Obama gave the food stamp but not coming back from and give you you you said it gave you an Obama ... on the head writer and data have a coke and a smile and and I say I love it for President Trump because\nHe's working for Americans and the American people are feeling the effects of that is good and what we want to vote\nDemocrat that it wouldn't even come to the table for tax cut that's right well what we want to vote but Democrats they keep putting\nAmerica could no longer exist the way we know it could yeah they wanted to read of America and they want to cut three when they bought it around this country that go into teaching people how to come in and respect our country as we wind up for that\nAnd then we have somebody like quick at Hillary than there have been dealing with the and then we get them back\nAnd you believe that basically that's what she said no no\nNo no but I don't believe me\nThat the woman who who could have been president United States\nActually said that is one of the most shocking thing that she is that a lot of wicked family and a lot of bad things but that is one of the most shocking things someone is going to get killed and she will have blood on her hands I mean she has to retract them I Hope she does retracted I'm an I ... I finally got your address I'm going to send you both a copy of Donald drain\nThe swamp if you do not love it I have failed because I wrote this book mainly people I mean really you you will love it and but we are going to put a a\nWait a minute from okay so wait a minute when we get the book and we ate a book and we like the book which come on our show\nI when we talk a bike and I would rather come on your show than on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon the answer is yes the answer is yes hang on one second hey hang on one second oh actually we're at a time or the answer is yes we gotta go

with the prices getting ... I see I think that the Democrats because they have they've effectively decided um to rather than have\nA kind of a coherent plan that's different from Trump's plan they just decided to attack the president which of course is their right but I think strategically it's an error um and I think they're losing\nLots and lots of African Americans which is genuinely historic because since gosh I don't know since FDR since before FDR or\nAfrican Americans have really been a ... they they felt like the Democratic party as their home and to the extent that that's changing that is shocking I mean it's actually shocking when you have any major figure like Kanye West of being respectful to the president visiting him wearing a make America it's just it's a fascinating a\nTime I don't know if I
