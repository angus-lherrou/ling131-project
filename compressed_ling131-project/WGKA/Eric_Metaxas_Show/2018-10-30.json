stuff to talk about we have to turn our attention so many things John you and I um [noise]\nWe think alike on just about everything and you ah have commented at the stream on um what happened at the synagogue a Saturday morning\nAnd the number of things so I just want to first of all I Want to talk about that 'cause that's on so many people's minds um and and and before I let you get a word in here let me say that\nI'm the I'm\nThe most horrifying thing that I saw\nWas my friend ... powers wrote an article effectively I couldn't read the article was behind a pay walk Washington Post but effectively blaming Trump's quote unquote rhetoric or against Jews or something like that I'm going to have to find that article and read it but people are saying that kinda stuff [noise]\nActually I think I think what she was talking about or was that his his criticism of immigration the fact that he's talking about trying to keep out this this refugee that its\nImmigration caravan or the keys to dark hair of and that's marching nor the storm to our border the fact that the president intends to stop them from entering the country\nAgainst the will of the Democrats are they eat plants to enforce our immigration laws it's supposedly responsible for this psychopathic lunatic\nWho hate fanatical hates Jewish people arbitrarily blaming one congregation of Jews because one of the people there who runs a refugee agency so he slaughters everyone in the synagogue\nAnd that's what the left is saying now is you see this is what happens when you speak out against mess illegal immigration you set off psychotic Nazis tool ... dozens of innocent people so you have to let all refugees\nAmerica forever for the well let me let me say this one's heading plead insanity\nOne thing you're not going to hear I don't think on any other radio program or TV program but you're going to hear from me folks\nAnd I hope that's why people tune in and they want to hear something that they're not hearing otherwise let's cut to the chase okay\nAt the heart of anything like this including the man sending the bombs around the bombs that didn't blow up but especially with murdering a eleven Jews at a synagogue and grievously wounding six others are more\nAt the heart of it is a satanic evil aimed at God that is what this is another was we we can talk about the the things around the edges\nAnytime and that's usually all people talking about but I Want to be clear when when somebody murders that ultimately a is an attack on God when someone murders a Jew it couldn't be clear that's an attack on God those are the people chosen by God\nAre those are the people out of whom God brought his messiah so that the whole world would be able to worship the God of the Jews\nThe devil hates Jews and you find a common thread in hatred around the world uh the the the um the radical Muslim world white nationalist in America\nBlack nationalist in America why do they all hate the Jews is a hatred of God the father the son and the Holy Spirit when we come back talking to John's miracle continue this conversation stick around\nHim nine twenty the answer\nTo this isn't about my

week I was saying when it comes to killing Jews there is nothing clear to me there's no clear expression of satanic evil than a murderous hatred of Jews we see it over and over and over again we saw it in the Soviet Union\nWe saw it in the enemies of the Soviet Union the national socialist a national socialist Germans under Hitler we see it in black\nNationalist we see it in white area and nationalist we see it in Muslims are who are radical\nWe see this everywhere and they all unite and hatred of the Jews I Want to be really clear that at the heart of this is nothing less than the person or the person a judge of evil Satan is behind this and so I just want to tell people if you want to know\nUm [noise] what's that the root of something like this you can trace it through history or is it is profound evil and it just happened the other day absolutely horrific that in Pennsylvania and the United states of America or something like this can happen at least in my\nIn my personal experience I I Will run into some of these these horrible pseudo fascist types you know you you you've seen them on the edges things they'll show up trying to hijack conservative events but they they pretty quickly show their show their true colors\nI Will never sell the presence of personal evil\nMore strongly than into circumstances when I when I when people like to start talking and and they they start inventing their hatred of God's own people\nThe Jews and outside of abortion clinics where they're killing babies those two places I feel that same sense of I Want holy water I Want to exercise is I Want to get away from there there's something called and profoundly malevolent and personally malevolent there that I don't feel anywhere else and I\nCan't explain it but that's that is why if you are personally close to the Jew Jesus or you know than attack on the Jews is an attack on God it's always been that way but very few Christians gifted sometimes Christians are more gentile than they are actually followers of Jesus and so in in Nazi times\nMany Christians were confused and they thought well ah the Jews the Jews were Christians but the real Christians like Detroit bottom opera understood that to attack the people of God is to attack\nThe people of Jesus is to attack God himself this has been the project since since eating\nAnd I think we need to be really clear on this one thing that I never thought I Would be saying\nBut there's tremendous anti Semitism you know this in Russia but also in Greece it's a fascinating thing that Greek nationalist think that their enemy\nAnd I think they used it to concoct the stories I mean even down to ... ... was working at Safeway well that was in the book\nThe only details that were not hopelessly vegan verifiable and impossible to check the only like ... inches in reality that any either those testimonies had came out of our judges book so I think whatever Democrats\nOr what whatever George Soros soup staffers were coming up with this stuff we're using marches memoir and he was accused of everything I mean Michael ... had him you know his his Julius so I think the one he brought to the table was said he was helping to want to get a\nGang rape ... organization all over the course of ... years\nAnd and and judge of course couldn't really effectively defend himself because in his memoir he admitted to having memory lapses and ... over and over again and people on on the Democratic committee said we want what judge here to testify we demand you subpoena mark judge ...\nKnowing of course that he uh he's written a book that he doesn't have\nYou know a reliable memory so they could have used his memory lapse as they could have weaponized\nThe disease that he had a severe teenage alcoholism in order to destroy Brett Kavanaugh I hate what they think is a pro life guy off the court\nOkay Mike ... I guess my question I got a couple of questions for the first one is\nIs it possible to get to the bottom of this of this in other words you're saying that they they they would can't we\nUltimately figure out who did this because if it is true that they orchestrated this that is the bomb shell of the year because so many people myself included felt a\nBad for a ... I Can't think of her her name the woman a print in four or ... ... you know you hear her story it's heartbreaking\nIf you think it was work is treated not just a memory lapse and she's confused and she's got post traumatic stress from whatever she went through she's a fragile messed up person in many ways\nBut if you think that oh it's not just that this was orchestrated this was planned that is really really horrifying Sylvia hurry\nYeah her attorney as he was dead were cats or the person who step forward and representative for free that woman for Fifteen Years has run a nonprofit funded almost entirely by George sources open society project\nOkay so if you're curious who's who which which kind of organizations are bought well behind his head job well George Soros was one of them\n[laughter] meanwhile meanwhile mark judge nobody paid his legal see if he's paying them now she's an unemployed freelance writer he lost his apartment he lost most of all his freelancing jobs\nAnd he he he's all it was on the verge of destitution I was able to help them set up a crowd funding thing and I hope your listeners will go visit it go to funding morality\nDot com and if you click on all project she'll see that mark judge is one of their main project\nFunding morality dot com dot\nCom and their try ... then click on all projects but I'm the heat we're trying to raise a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars for march so he can pay off his lawyers and get his apartment back in and get back on his feet because this is his name was dragged through the mud\nOr he was accused of being gang rape organizer and Joel lugging teenage girls over the course of years with no proof whatsoever and and he just complete try victim and and no ... nobody\nI don't think enough people remembered well who who ... who is doing the victims here yes Brett Kavanaugh was the victim but now he had a lifetime appointment to the highest court and all that so you know Clarence Thomas continued to pay a price for the false charges made against him but ultimately being on the court is quite an indication of\nMarch is just you know a body left by the side of the road so I Hope people will go to funding morality dot com and click on all projects and and look at mark judge is a I outsource I\nHope so as well John ah that people will go to funding morality dot com all projects I'm your article the lynching of mark judge is at PJ Media is that the J media dot com\nYes yes he Jay you're so prolific I Want to be clear PJ Media dot com and all other ...
