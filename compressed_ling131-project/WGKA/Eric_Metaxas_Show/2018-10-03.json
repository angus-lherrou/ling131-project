I was right\nAnd David reminds us that he enjoys Republican approval as a quote unquote conservative commentator David read some of what he wrote picked it apart and I want you to want you to take this with you today\nObviously he says he's known for the fairest viewer stuff the whole thing there um but what he's talking about his cabinet\nAnd David says and I quote it's instructive that Stein ... what is playing out on the Democratic side of the aisle is thinly disguised style and him\nAnd that ... is the goal was genocidal tyranny being the result it's not hyperbole Stein's observations are allowed to stand quote there is no trial\nOn facts or law any longer I Want you to think about what you just heard Stein say there is no trial on facts or law any longer that's why they've it tells us it's not hyperbole if his observations are allowed to stand continuing as others have pointed out we now have guilt by accusation\nJust stopped Donald Trump the Democrats have tossed out the whole basis of Anglo saxon jurisprudence innocent until proven guilty is there no end to it Stalin would approve so Joseph goals quote if this Democrat trick worked there simply is no meaningful legal protection in this country any longer\nThis was a defining moment for the constitution Republican wake up now here's where the brilliance of David ... comes in\nBecause he had another diary entry in American Spectator contradicting what David says its own sub had quote the time for civilians to own a are Fifteen is over Stein wrote this back in February\nAnd he says David gives us the quote let's have at least a modicum\nOf common sense I'm going to quote Stein in David's piece titled Second Amendment guy Ben Stein should learn before presuming to teach and I want to quote what David puts in here from his peace than science these\nIn the diary in his piece called the diary over the American spectator from back in February quoting now I'm a Second Amendment guy\nI Believe Americans who are saying and do ... ... excuse me I Believe Americans who are saying and not criminals and pass a genuine background test should be allowed to own weapons for home protection for target shooting and for self defense of this is what I Love about David and wisdom and his intelligence\nPrior restraints where shall not be infringed question mark allowed question mark of course David is saying well wait a minute what about shall not be infringed ban and what's this\nAllowed to own and then David says perhaps Stein could point to the delegated power in the constitution he says he recognizes defining moments for\nAnd David points out the thing we've discussed on this program so many times over the years\nThat and every professional gun grabber and anybody who professes to believe in the second amendment always does shows everybody is big but\nI Believe in the second amendment or I support the second amendment but there is no but in the second amendment David continues but for the life of me\nI cannot see why any American civilians need an AR Fifteen or any other military style semi automatic rifle\nHere's what that's a quote from start here's a further quote from that same piece it's horrifying and yet another example of why no civilian needs an AR Fifteen or affects them each just sickening remember this is coming from a professed done guy\nNow a few months later after someone took away had his guns taken away two times and then shot up David reminds us a gun free waffle house\nStein said I'm a Second Amendment guy but no one needs a gun that just bags the owner to start shooting people oh for crying out loud\nBen Stein might want to take David hog out for dinner and the two of them can come up with the most outrageous quotes and begin tweeting but remember Stein gets passed because unlike David ... Stein told us he's a gun guy no gun guy in the world says something so stupid\nI'm a Second Amendment guy I don't know really want to know what a second I'm not sure what a Second Amendment guy is but no I'm I guess that means gun rights supporter I Know being a little cynical here [noise] I'm\nAnd the guy but no one needs a gun that just begs the owner to start shooting people\nI have multiple a are Fifteen in the studio with me\nAnd I know some of your average breast you're concerned because they have my back to them not a one of them has begged me to start shooting people now David says and I quote only\nDelusional lunatics who can't be trusted without a custodian believe their guns are begging them to do anything\nThis conservative bought leader who would presume to instruct is on the constitution has embraced the primitive legal concept of the day or Dan where an inanimate object could be blamed for death and then seized by the government\nA was having trouble sleeping tormented by a lot of that and a key date\nApril two thousand eleven he was a channel surfing three o'clock in the morning and here's this guy talking to a couple of international business guys lap and to be Donald Trump and er he got this premonition that he was a hearing the voice of the next president\nOkay this is now I read it at that time pretty amazing two thousand and eleven\nHe Donald Trump on TV and he believes that God's speak to him and says this is the next president of the United states now to believe that Donald Trump can be president in two thousand eleven is plum loco so what could mark tailor\nThe firemen think when God speak did God's speak to him normally was this new thing for him\nSome very new thing for him and like I say it was three of the morning and he actually wrote it in his diary and and he put a question mark\nBy like really [laughter] and what it didn't happen he kind of forgot all about it and wait wait wait in ... when he twelve is what you're saying\nYeah exactly and then uh you know several years later fast forward he was a\nUm having some treatment with a doctor Colbert\nAnd are you shared some of his diary and this came up and Dr Coburn would very intrigued by it now it's like being the Fifteen million is sixteen and\nA and it's a real thing and that basically became a ... look of prayer across the country and many many of us know that you know the faith community had a I think a big part of a Trump becoming president\nAnd a big rallying point and um but this this prayer you call that a Nancy Colbert the doctor's wife started a blew up servers all over America they were over a hundred thousand people calling in\nUh towards the ... got closer to the election uh every day and I am you know to pray for our nation well business something my ...\nMy wife and I know about this and that's one of the reason I wanted to have you wanted to tell my listeners about this because this is not crazy this is very very\nUm shocking when you hear the details but I've looked into it closely enough that I take it seriously that ... some people here from God mark Taylor is one of those people you just a person just like any of us are he's not some amazing scene but he does\nPray and he hears from God and what I have read about him a and I've heard some of his interviews I thought\nThis guys on the level this guy's not kooky or he's very buttoned\nUp ... he's just not a some people when you hear them you think ...\nWho knows what we're getting we're getting you know right ten percent God and Ninety percent to ... but this guy that strikes me is very real and Mary Colbert exactly the same thing and people can look them up on line ... CEO Welby yard tea and mark Taylor but I Want to encourage my audience to look into\nThis and it's why I wanted to have you won as I said so the film eating out tonight how people\nLook this up I mean if people say like I've got nothing to do tonight where do I go see this\nYeah and I got to tell you were in every major market across the country a fabulous and it didn't oriented movie uh we wanted this movie to come out right before the midterms so they gave us the dates they did and it's and it's that type\nOf stuff here with the second in the Fort Seventeen them all over America and wherever you buy tickets you know whether it's then they go fathom a bench dot com\nYou can go to the Trump prophecy movie to ... uh I Would encourage people to pre by their tickets or cause tickets are selling out a lot of theaters are adding an additional screens because this has got some momentum now and you're\nA ... as they do sell out theaters they bump another movie out and and give us another strain because it's it's an event oriented type release but er I encourage you to go up more than anything it's a message about prayer innocent message about\nGod and country and and and gone in our lives I think you'll see that this this movie is a very patriotic\nVery uplifting inspiring message and uh so we hope that you'll you'll be a part of it and go see it\nWell I think that I Want to tell my listeners that the Trump prophecy movie dot com the from the Trump prophecy movie dot com if you want to find out it's October second and October fourth\nI'm Mark a Taylor is an extraordinary person as I said I've heard him interviewed and I want to interview him on this\nThis program so I Want to get a hold of him and marry\nA Kobe or I don't know how to reach them but I I think it's important to my audience hear about this stuff and see what they make of it some people will be very troubled they say well I I don't like the idea that people are hearing from God today I had the Bible is good enough for me and so just the idea\nThat if somebody is hearing prophetic Lee in this way is controversial in the Christian Community but I from what I have seen\nA there are some people for whom this is the real thing is is not something they're making up and mark Taylor strikes me as one of those people how did you come to know his story and to want to tell his story ... film\nYeah a friend who so there's in mind kind of a mutual friend introduced us or writing the book was coming out\nAnd uh when I met them a while you were saying about markets so true I mean I I didn't know what to think either you know I'm thinking this guy's a profit I mean I'm thinking a guy with a cane and uh you know long beard and you know something\nUh but I met a very humble very normal guy who ah you literally had a a very humble message that God has given them and some of the trust by that and I'm\nMary did a very credible thing she said we need to call our nation to prayer\nUh so I said wow this is a story that could inspire people especially as we get towards the midterms and uh and and you know that's happening again this prayer chain is continuing through them in terms of marriage still involved in that so I'm sure she loves to talk about it\nI Would I Would love that and when we come off the air or you can give us an information because I Do think it's important we pray for the country and doesn't matter where people stand\nPolitically you don't have to like this president a right but I Do think everybody is obliged to pray for this country this country was or has been used by God to do great things in the past and there's no reason to believe\nOr he doesn't want to have his hand on this country but he relies on the prayers\nOf his people so the idea that mark Taylor by sharing this with his doctor started a gigantic prayer chain before the ... election that alone is phenomenal when when one of my idea and\nAs you said it was it's huge I mean it was a lot of people praying for the for the election because people wonder how is it possible and Trump could have possibly gotten elected I Would say a lot of it probably had to do with this prayer Jane\nAgree yeah absolutely\nI think the the other thing for people to notice in in the at the end of the movie we have found that gives us an opportunity to kind of a real selective conversation and I've got fourteen world you know faith leaders\nAre people like the former communications director for Netanyahu or people like general boy and people like the former CEO of ... Martin\nTalking about what does it mean for America to be great economically what does it mean militarily what does it mean to the middle east and specifically to Israel so there's a lot of additional

she must be right not only that something terrible happened but that she's identified the perpetrator\nAnd how can how can then fairness without presumption of innocence and all those things that we hold dear we just\nCast those all aside and simply say well it was about the Supreme Court so I Will rush to judgment I Will presumed guilt and I think that's just profoundly wrong so a breath and I'm sure you just called judge Kavanaugh buddies so geared to me and I said that at that to the world I'm a grad\nHas been I think treated very unfairly he called it a national disgrace\nFrom his perspective I think it is not just a family tragedy for him and his beautiful family but frankly I think it's a national trash speeding\nWill recover from it as we always do with a strong people but I think we now need to have a base conversation about fear that's just because someone a alleges something\nThat is the old song goes it ain't necessarily so at least with respect to it was Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I just don't think it was I Believe ...\nWell but again it is it really so much about believing him as it is looking at the facts in other words let's say he said what he said and she said what he said and then we could say well based on what I Know I Believe him because we know his character but the fact uh don't lead us\nTo believe him based on what he said they they lead us to believe him based on the evidence that's been offered and that's that's what I find chilling is that people it it's one thing to only have these two testimonies but we have\nOther evidence or to corroborate or not corroborate and that has to be to use the legal term dispositive right I mean if we have nothing else to go on we've got to go on what we've got\nAnd she has been produced any

I have to say and so I always joined uh have you on the program talking about anything before we get too much\nInto your book 'cause we've got that time today and tomorrow I still have to ask you about um the mole or investigation of about a year ago when they had you on the program you had confidence uh in in Robert\nMueller Bob you called him somebody that uh you've known all over the years but after a year has unfolded I have become increasingly upset\nOr with the with the scope of the investigation and win what seems to me a like a partisan bias which of course is horrific since ah that's not supposed to be happening what what is your take or at least what can you say about that at this point\nI still have confidence in Bob ... of course of great integrity a he's a he's a great patriot I think he served as a country very well including in uniform so as a very brave rage supper or he is a great great deal of being a person's face\nA wants to do the right thing now I have expressed concerns about some of the people around town and then of course goes to all of a judgment\nA and so I don't need to go the personalities but they're just been some issues raised about deep partisanship and so forth of course everyone in public life has a person doesn't apply to have his or her views but when you're a prosecutor you got to make sure you check those views of the door just turning square corners etc [noise] uh but\nUh I think Bob has already done magnificent work so I'm kind of you might already among my friends or the ...\nWell I mean listen I Hope you're right but no no I I was just gonna say I so hope you're you're right you're you're one of the few people who might be able to convince me a\nOn that or because he really um I I think the scope of the investigation is worrisome a there's a young woman a in a maximum security a location right now Maria Butina she was labeled as a foreign and uh I I happen to know her and I know people who are around her\nAnd they are adamant that this is this is absolute madness that there's absolutely nothing to Vincent here you have a very young woman in her twenties in a horrific\nA situation twenty two hours a day in solitary with a a a cement bunk and just just a\nHorror and and uh I I feel like there's a kind of madness that has descended over the country with regard to so called Russian collusion and I'm a I'm grieving for my country right now\nMentioned Juanita Broderick who is willing to\nThis debt to tell her story of a forcible rape\nAnd this was on a high school or college a bit but by the attorney general of art saw she came to become governor he was running for governor is there such concerns serious stuff but so many in the media\nDid not take it seriously but so Pete with too broad a brush her very quickly Lisa Myers of NBC now retired is the one who broke Juanita Broderick story God Bless her\nHowever NBC is a network tried to sit on the story I Can't say such good things about network\nWell there's there's little question that whatever NBC once was it has now become a part as an organization it's no longer a news organization\nWhich is a which is a pity because it uh it it ... it has had a great days and it's passed but this is another problem uh our media are at this point um [noise]\nIt seems to me mostly in the bag a for\nThose who are against Trump and it's an it's infected everything of course it's infected this uh the Kavanaugh investigation he would have flown through with flying colors than any previous point in our history but because he is a the so called swing vote\n'em that the Democrats I I'm Sorry to say have you know they have in fact a\nA excavated a new low there's nothing in our past to compare with this and I and I do feel um I feel troubled for the country uh\nBut I guess a lot of us felt that way during the Clinton investigation as well were you worried about your country at that time what do you think would eventually come of this because you were so vilified\n[noise] I was at work for the country uh I was just ...\nHoping that we could come to the end of the fact finding a process and you know the truth comes out of their mechanisms in our country in contrast to so many for the truth I'm Out at yes even in the media the media\nOr try to remain strong strong and true and say we we just want is Jack ... who's to say in the olden days on track now just just the facts lead us assess the facts but you only have some commentators come on\nTo his or her opinion that's great but would you please report the facts and don't report the facts selectively try to be honest we want honest government I think we will an honest person so I think we are at a very difficult time Eric in terms of\nA journalistic ethics and so forth was chosen heir and under the left and the right you know usual though the truth of the truth show set your free and so the the thing that did not a cause we worry about the country or even I was told as I recite those in the book\nThat someone walked in one day and I tell the story and the office a jury of this issue is a jazz guess what added open door policy maybe I shouldn't have said hey your numbers your poll numbers of apple logo Saddam Hussein\nMy reaction was well hey that's not good but there's no place to go but up\nTo us\nIs that we have actually balances in the country and one of them of course is our court system yeah that's what makes with a cabinet nominations so very important because I said look we can't fight effectively investigations but I go to some details us of the book we can't\nDo battle on Madison Avenue was all PR people the Clinton the spin the machine and so forth but we can't do is maintain or honesty and professionalism in the courts of law before to the grid orders are citizens and the\nTrial jurors to pet a truce scores citizens yes our audience not the American people as a whole\n... or so eventually you know the truth came out about a Bill Clinton's a\nAbuse of power people would say oh it's just all about that relationship and leave aside the power structure with his being built um a person that power she being an introvert and so forth there was nothing forcible about it but it was it was a employment kind of relationship with\nHis sons were leaves the morality of say ... Twain him and just gone and his family what ... was all about as you well know there was about the rule of law perjury obstruction of justice\nUse of his presidential powers to prevent the troops were coming out\nThat's that's exactly right where we're at a time to de judge star but if you hang on a I'd love to continue the conversation and we will air it tomorrow on this program folks as the air
