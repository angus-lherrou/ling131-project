{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "When Damon Wayans posted that when the little photo of him with a tiny cut on the back of his bald head\nAnd he actually called it a shot rap now injury I'm Sorry that is complete and total fake ... I've had worse injuries on my cuticle at the NATO salon\nI I you know a ... minute habit but I'll say this I was shooting a movie two years ago in Budapest and I went through a ... it was a phone call spectral that we shot from Netflix\nAnd I went to a glass door in a shorter glass four inches long went into my armpit and it severed all the nerves in my left on oh gosh I don't have I only have one by up and only two of my triceps they'd never regenerated\nI never said anything to anyone I took my surgery didn't have hosted on [laughter]\nI went through four surgeries a it was extremely um\nDifficult uh you know you'd think that you're not going to have the use of your arm yeah um and especially being an actor right\nUm I I never made it personal\nUh I I take I take responsibility for my own actions and when I it's like if I'm going to play football if I Want my child if my child is going to play sports\nI acknowledge the threat to the dangers that come with that share I Can't turn and blame someone else I'm you know again I was directing that episode so again I take full responsibility for it\nThe problem here is that actors are kooky I'm kooky everyone I've ever worked with a somewhat kooky\nSo broadcasters like people in the entertainment business we're all we're supposed to leave your hat [laughter] I think like her way up there in the psychopath we hire people\nThat were suits for living who have degrees from prestigious universities and we put them in charge to kind of manage the circus innocence and I'm just you know you got a coach got Nick Saban done in Tuscaloosa this got two five star great quarterbacks and he's able to to\nNavigate though he goes in their best ... friends right you guys can't get two actors making a ton of money on the same page so you know again it it it is what it is I'm grateful for the experience I Wish those guys nothing but luck\nWell that's nice of you to say but I Wish them nothing but misery because they took away my favorite character on my favorite show it is the most ...\n... thing I've ever seen is the worst decision that\nFox and Warner Brothers have made sense I can remember so whatever lethal weapon is dead to me and it's probably not going to last past this season however I Will say\nThat I tuned in just for the first episode to see how they were going to handle the unfair and timely disgusting death of Martin rags and he did give me just a little satisfaction deceit Damon Wayans have to pretend for an hour they missed\nYou know I Wish that shine William Scott all the luck in the world and I feel sorry for him to says no idea what he's stepping in to I don't\nThink he knew any idea what he was stepping into the beginning you know I I from ... from the people who I talked to on crew who are still buddies and they call me during football games you know they say this guy's pretty pretty sad and that he was kind of soda bag of good I'm sure\nI'm sure for you I just can't wait to see what you do after you're done mowing the lawn [laughter] you know you know for\nUs we're just happy to be back in the state and we're working on HER Foundation you know which again how beautiful\nIt for me to be in the situation for two years and we were able to get a foundation up and running that first year we've had two successful events we raised over a hundred thousand dollars last year and we're giving it back to the individuals where we can see the money go first hand you know I my my my whole thing was when it comes to charity is a lot of times\nYou're paying for overhead and and you never really know where your resources and we all work hard for our money and and we all want to feel like that we did and we support those that are less less fortunate\nBut for me I I was in my buddy's house and his his mother in law was a or his stepmother by the way was was was was loading up backpacks and she'll be doing you know she said well there's a lot of children\nThat don't get to eat on the weekends I'm because of families don't have enough resources to provide so\nTheir last meal comes from school on that friday that's correct she go so I put together this food and some underwear socks and his food for the whole family I just got covered in ... and my heart and I said well who's doing this with you and she said well I've got another friend and she's at her house in her garage packing up her lunch and we'll get them all and\nThey will take them up for the school and I looked at my wife and I said this is who we help the people that have devoted their life to helping others I I'm not that selfless I like entertaining\nTo being a goofball so for me if I can help those people who have devoted their life to helping others that I Know exactly where the money's going so if I say to you okay you guys support this will it's going to ... vote at three hot and it caught those guys are getting that ... they're going to use that thirty grand\nBy X Y and Z and then I think that makes us feel better about where money's going to that kind of been our motivation throughout this whole process well\nI saw you on Instagram I mean you're huge on Instagram you really used Instagram to promote a lot of different things and I almost or my shirt but I thought God that'd be really really cheap where am I just don't trash the stash\nShirt because I Would have worn it today I purchased it solely to support your foundation I Know that you guys were doing something you were promoting you need to ... you know raise money for veterans\nUm you were doing some big promotion I was like oh my\nI Am sure you know it's crazy that sure came in and that was those go to tame and quick to and they came in so here's what's funny they had been working on that\n... months before we knew about the negative stuff so how funny that don't trust the stash turned into action of may completely trailer I Know who was it and there is no coincidence his life\nAnd look these guys called us and they go hey can we send you some ideas and I go to great extend it to me I look at it and I'm like that's pretty funny but it's going to stay and they go look you don't have to do anything we ... we do all the work and then we give you the money and then a match and dragons contacted us and they reacted foundation for camp with cancer and uh\nAnd again it all just lined up perfectly we'd been so grateful and also to be in the south I look forward to\nI Want to shoot here I Want to work in the south I think we have so many resources and stayed\nIn a lot happening in Birmingham and as a matter of fact last year I had the opportunity to speak with the producer of the film that you were the big star of the weight and it was so happy they decided to do opening night here in Birmingham\nThe only bummer was it you were filming lethal weapon and you could never get away by the pill and had a whole bunch of people go and check it out and we need to see you do some more stuff here in the south the Portland\nOr the south you know anyone asked me about Birmingham is it like set for him he\nWins [laughter] it would have to do that [laughter]\nUm you know there there's the fruit seem to show incredible and I think uh in in ... what's happening with the film was I think the overflow from Atlanta Atlanta has blown up especially with pine which is being built and it was kind of set up shop down there and people are realizing oh you're just drive a couple of hours and you can get the same thing\nSo I I Am hoping to ... raise it to where to someone shoot film here and a story all the buildings yeah right that's right there's a lot of history isn't it yeah like ... streets\nExactly I mean back in the seventies when we abandon the buildings we just left them standing and said now everybody's going back in the renovation and the restoration and we have such\nBeautiful architecture it's just a perfect said hey look I I plan on going nowhere well I cannot tell you how happy that makes your fans and let me just reiterate one more time\nSince Klain Crawford is way too polite to do this everything that was on social media that was pushed with this snake\nFalse narrative that he was a hair on set screaming children and the set was unsafe\nIt's all complete BS\nAnd I think by now most people know this because they've seen the stories that are still coming out\nAnd now it's really clear exactly what happened there but I'm so glad you're here and congratulations because the foundation came out of this everyone can go there right now and get all the information Crawford foundation dot org you're talking about bullying\nYou know this month and again it's just a though there are no wizards was but yeah I you know I think for us we're no\nRaising awareness I think it starts with the parents in and starts at home and how a lot of the time to do that are doing the bullying\nThey're getting what would that be correct and it's heartbreaking that they're they're just they're they're reacting and\nAnd and and we need to just go to the stores and showed that we're trying to ... to get parents involved and to make sure that we're asking the difficult questions are good starting a dialogue with that they're not taking the energy to school and taking it out on the other ... so you have to leave but don't\nGet it is profit foundation dot org lane Crawford I just cannot wait to see what you do next and make sure that you come back and talk just about an attack\n[noise] you've been listening to viewpoint Alabama a

I got it feel bad about that my wife and my youngest daughter still do but yeah I see\nAnd then another whole aspect of this too I mean a couple of years ago I I uh I got a double them all again swine flu and I had died a couple of times on the on life support\nOr ... yeah I think uh\n\nMy goodness so you died a couple of times and ... and and this yeah this is did we speak before no I don't think\n... are you you don't hear that often the whole died a couple of times now when when this occurred uh ... when this occurred uh this is a clinical death rate that they're just stopping in a heartbeat is what you're talking about\nRight yeah first time it stopped for failing to ... minutes and ... a couple of days later the three and a half minutes\nMy goodness so I went and saw my ...\nAnd everything all that stuff\nYou've had your share of some some ugly time some very rough times and you're trying to work yourself through them now\nYeah that's that's ... ... well\nYou're ... the thing that it is about churches is their their community\nAnd unfortunately sometimes in that community um they don't always know how to deal\nWith everything we can just been running seen throughout the show and started with the concept of Halloween in paganism all these things and what you cut out of your life what you don't and sometimes the church\nReally doesn't know how to respond to certain\nUgly parts of life or the divorce and things like that or even on the death of someone or strange circumstances or whatever it is\nAnd they just\nThey they don't run to the aid of and this is an old churches but some do and this may or may not be the church that you were attending a in the case but in that case as well but really um the important thing is for you to find\nA church to grow and to be rooted in regardless of whether it's that church you were originally in or not is there a\n... ... what is your goal in all of this what are you trying to trying to get the family back together or are you trying to make yourself whole again what is your goal\nI think the primary thing would be to make myself whole again so I can get the family back together we I have four children too so so we're just we didn't just screw up their lives you know their friends all of our friends all over relative of thirty one years building up\nSo it's a lot it's a lot of you know and they the crazy thing is that you know it is though\nThat I think there's some way it could be a man that I just don't know how to get it all back together and you know it it gets along with I think the long term plan but\nThey don't and I just don't feel comfortable going back to that church right now and then they have it and you know like I say they haven't reached out one diamond said hey you know how you doing it I was like\nReally is it a large church very large church yeah that happens\nAt the very live as many many of them you know so they are and it's like I said there's\nThere's you know there is a factor that churches is I've always been turned off about a hypocritical ... some people it's like it's okay you shouldn't do that than I should do this and listen to NPR in ... you're saying that\nTo find a middle road because everything you do not always though that's a terrible thing you know just by watching you know you know Halloween movie or something you know that's not like a year the devil worship or you're you're just joining a movie or something you\nKnow I find that the church uh likes the pendulum to swing hard left or hard right and\nAnd that doesn't mean to be mediocre eh I say in scripture if you're lukewarm ... out of my mouth it's not not to be warm it's a matter of finding that balance gym it's a matter of saying okay well\nAh where is a place of health for me and something that will not distracted take me away from the gospel or my face and\nIn your circumstances a\nIn going through pain or a a divorce or any of these things can be quite distracting and God's desire is always for reconciliation when possible if your wife's not here to talk um and speak for herself but I'd be I'd be curious to see\nA gym if your wife was on the phone and I asked her why you guys got a divorce what do you see the top three reasons she would give\n\nA she would probably start off with a weed I don't have to have a steady income doing you know because ah yeah I had you know a lot of it yeah I was in the hospital for two weeks but you know a couple of years ago that they you know it took me two or three months they recuperate from that so\nOkay what would be the second\nOut there so that would be the financial aspects that I Would think it would be any ... any type of drinking of alcohol whatsoever but\nAt the same time she she has a martyr either that there too and I'm not I'm a casual drinker but you know he thinks that that you know I've never ever get on that a person who gets abusive or whatever you know but you know\nOkay I'll I'll let you go by these point by point in your ... and then the third\nI Would say the relationship that I have with the ah for kids you know though all four kids are pretty much like ... ... and I hate to say this but on my side you know they take their mom is you know their their mother with is gone through a ... you know for after doing all that and a positive stuff and everything\nShe did like a one eighty at one point or and I was\nKnow I always find that to try to help her and her business for things that she was doing and she got to be kind of a drain on the family money around and\nOkay ... yeah we we loaned her sisters to buck the money and her sister ever paid it back OK well we have a bunch of issues there you know a lot of issues\nThere and those going in a couple of different directions gym so I Would say the financial one me deal with something just a beyond finances have you always been kind of in and out of work\nI Know that ... that you know there are actually I have a couple of businesses and the badly and I made it you know tons of money and I\nAnd then there's also employed mostly or\nA ...

guy that was Tony ... and it has to Jesus Christ show I Am\nYour whole we host happened to be with you a this Sunday as him every single Sunday right here answering your questions of talking about things that truly matter in life and the afterlife here's a a really quick way to tell\nYou're listening to Portuguese or not if you hear it and go oh that's pretty Spanish no ... no a French oh an Italian if you say those three things the\nForest choice should be Portuguese and you'll be right just a little tip for me to you know\nWe started earlier today talking about the concept of paganism and how it permeates really everything the that if as a believer you are trying to run from\nAnything dealing with paganism that you will have an easier time trying to pick an actor who hasn't been in a film\nWith who Tony Kevin Bacon\nAnd that is to say that they're there in life or any culture that cultures are built upon really ah somebody living in a place looking to the left and looking to the right and seeing what the natural resources are to make clothing\nOr to make food and this becomes the culture\nSo if you know you see the uh Mexican culture to culture or um you see\nYou know to decide you see a Native American culture or you keep looking around and seeing oh well this is the German culture and if you pull them a apart you'll start seeing that they intertwined quite a bit\nAnd the Mexican culture the use of certain instruments including a\nYou know are playing a certain types of songs that sound like they're ... when you when you hear them and you go where did that come when that comes from Germany\n\nSo when you see these things at or hear them and you go well where did this come from where you'll find that they melt together or American Indians are no longer living in the peace will culture changes and grows and uh it's not that to the accordion was native to\nMexico it's that it's brought there and then it gets used in ah the foods if you look at the region uh I'm I'm always humor by people that go into different parts of Central America and the like and start looking for a thirty is thinking well right\nThey they've got beans got rice they've got no they don't and that there's different even though there's going to be similarities in certain places are going to be differences and others and this is the same with religion or face you have the word of God which is in ... in scripture\nAnd pointing to things both culturally that were going on in the time both with pagan Z and with\nA or Jewish brothers and sisters and these things are all taking part and going in different directions for serving a particular purposes\nAnd still are intertwined with their immediate cultures as well the food of the day and the you know that the thinking of Passover you think of the things that are taking place with the breaking of bread that's all because that was the culture of the time so some things around religion will change as well\nIf you want to read your self of all pagan concepts it's not about Halloween Halloween really although it's a derivative or if you traced all the way back to sow in\nWhich was a Celtic festival yes where you can say well that's pagan but then you have a pope Gregory the third\nDesignating November first is all saints day than the day prior automatically became all Hallows eve and that becomes Halloween so it has a Christian twist throughout the centuries as well\nAnd you start looking at these things and seeing that it's more than just the obvious and that's what I Want from you\nWhen you're using discernment discern not just based on the obvious but about a true understanding about what's going on there are things in Christianity that uh our our ... our direct result of paganism across most certainly the fish\nAnd the application of the fish fish most certainly\nYou look or you know at the uh the symbol for Virgo you can look it up on line and you'll see the fish embedded in that very simple\nAlong with the Hebrew character from ... you'll you'll see these things there's there's more to it than just to clean lineage and that's because people are participating in it doesn't mean have the ... in your house or ... grams or know what I'm saying saying use good judgment healthy judge\nAnd don't have that attitude of just a a zero tolerance because that's just lazy spirituality\nI

end of summer\n\nDuring this festival people would like these huge communal bonfires and yeah they were costumes mostly comprised of animal heads and for hours and they did this to ward off roaming spirits in ghosts that's kind of the basic element\nOf what Halloween was in one sense or another it's kind of the ...\n\nWhen he when he eats century finally rolled around pope Gregory this third designated November first as something called all saints day\nThis was a was a time to honor saints and martyrs that had passed on you can't look at that as a bad thing centrally honoring those in the Christian family that had done good\nAnd we're no longer on this earth\n\nWell is often is the case this particular this new holiday\nMany of the traditions of the ... festival so a lot of the things\nThat kind of the ... that were already uh be used to celebrate in sound when\nWe're now kind of attached to this all saints day you can kind of\nThink of it this way it's much easier to paint an old building and put up a new sign and it needs to to tear down the whole building and start from scratch right and this was nothing new it had been done many times before for instance many pagan customs were combined with Christianity wouldn't Constantine\nWent through the big conversion his was a slow conversion but when he latched onto it sometime around his forties\n\nHe converted the official pagan religion of the Roman empire to Christianity as it was between three twenty and three three eighty so little things came in and found their way home to Christianity that had a beginning in paganism\n\nSo back to a all saints day the evening before all\nStay was a known is all Hallows eve and this is you can figure out later became Halloween\n\nBut over the centuries\nThis this day this Halloween has evolved and continues to evolve and continues to change and now it's moved into this is secular and\nIncredibly commercial I mean right behind Christmas commercial\nGo go out to a market or something today and you'll see just how commercial it is and it continues to get larger and larger each year and is Halloween becomes massive so over the centuries and it continues to evolve it becomes secular incredibly commercial and really it's the celebration\nThat has embraced by communities many communities\nAs more of a you know child centric holiday because of its activities like trick or treating or decorating your home to look spooky really focuses on children and their desire to be creative or playing make believe we're dress up for these types of things\n\nAnd I know that this becomes controversial because of its origin and there's a battle within the church is to what to do now first and foremost thing that should be thought of is safety always if you're\nIf you don't feel safe in your neighborhood or you don't feel safe certain things there's all kinds of alternative things to do your community community does other things that are are more controlled that's great even churches do\n\nBut just shy away from it because of its origin doesn't necessarily um\nA point to balance thinking in the church and it's not that your children should be running around I'm dressed as mayhem and the devil and all of these things there there are middle grounds that you could do where you can partake in certain aspects of it\nAnd it can be enjoyed\nNot abused anyway because the truth of the matter is with healthy parent parental involvement Halloween can be fun and creative time for children\n\nI assure you and if you're worried about their involvement kids aren't parsing the\nMultifaceted theological underpinnings of the possibility of antecedent pagan genesis I assure you\nThey just want to play dress up and get free sweets\nThat's it

mistake or this is not and apologetic for Halloween or pagan activities\nIt's a defense of reason and discernment\nAnd as a Christian using those tools or to find a balanced approach to the things that surround you in this life you are in this world\nYou were in it by choice of God\nAnd there is a lot a lot of Christians who won from every thing because of origins and I'm going to show you why that might not be as easy as you think\nAnd every year I get calls in tweets and emails about Halloween and yes it is a Halloween is rooted in paganism but that doesn't automatically mean that a Christian can't partake in it in some way or some fashion\n\nSo this Celtic festival of Sao in a later\nOr through a pope Gregory the third designated November first\nAs all saints day so it's all around the same time and this is to honor the saints in the martyrs but a lot of the traditions and ideas and certain other practices in from the ... festival made its way into that as well\n\nThe evening before\nOr this became a known as a all Hallows eve that became Halloween now you've got this very commercial secular\nNon pagan religiously anyways\nEvent and it's important to just realize that God's problem\nWith paganism or other belief systems\nIs not necessarily their practices but that they do those practices while worshipping another God altogether exodus twenty first three you show have no other God's performing let's say if the lord that as God's word that's the concern\nGod wants you to celebrate in glorify him and every thing you do\n... and has\nTo understand this a little better just keep in mind two thousand years ago pagan sacrificed animals\nBut so did our Jewish brothers and sisters under God's command the same act with different intent was now a pleasing aroma to God as it says in genesis eight twenty and Twenty one and I'll read that the NOAA built an altered to the lord\nAnd taking some of the clean animals and cleaning birds he sacrificed burnt offerings on it the lord smelled the pleasing aroma and set in his heart never again like curse the ground because of humans even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from\nChildhood and never again will lie destroy all living creatures as I have done\nSo it's not just the act itself it is the intent is the purpose of that act that matters to God sacrifice to idols or a false God not good\nSacrifice to the one true holy and right just God\nGood he pleasing aroma\nDiscarding something just because ... or any other faith did it at one time or does it now really isn't isn't balanced and it isn't thoughtful\nIt's the\nIt's like that or you know vegetarianism is bad because Hitler adhered to uh primarily vegetarian diet just seems like a weird way to go about life rather than seeing things for what they are and using them to glorify God\nOr its fallacious to think that because something had origins here orange origins over here that it's good or bad really it's the

yes that's that's my point that you have feasts\nThat are Jewish and brother are brothers and sisters part took in around the same times\nAs they were pagan feast and the Jews did not want to appear to be pagan elliptical laws as a matter of fact uh the majority of them or to a\nA separate themselves from the even the appearance of being pig and yet they did things that pagan did as well so it wasn't about the thing that they did it was about how they applied down\nRight and I understand I understand but the difference between what I'm Talking about the the ring or that situation is that Jesus thank God the ladder ... thanks to fight al at Wayne\n... there are things that are being sent to fight every day by the use of a Christianity I mean do you celebrate Christmas\nOf course the earth K. right yeah but that's not sink defied by God in any stretch any way shape or form and scripture there's never a celebration about that nor is there a celebration of Easter or those were the only ... ... ... ... no that's not the day of his birth that's about two years\nLater the purpose of all of this is that those things that you're talking about have become comfortable to you because they've been passed down do you not because of their origins there is not a matter of fact the early church didn't celebrate it in that sense and those are in those land on pagan holidays and word\nUsurped did both Easter and Christmas\nAnd a lot that ties into those things in this things that you celebrate really tie into pagan beliefs the tree in the house the eggs and the bunny all of those things but it's what you do with him that matters not with from where they came from you came\nFrom a dark place in God's sanctify due and through the blood on the cross he can sink to find the

... you'd be surprised how much\nIt is it has infiltrated not on its own but willingly by different groups or a leaders like constant\nAnd the like um that had shaved off as much of it as they could and then apply the others so that there was comfort level in its growth as a matter of fact Christianity can be argued by\nHistorians at least um I might have a different thought but um that a lot of that is what propelled Christianity\nYou know Rome Constantine changing Roman and their national religion and belief system at first it was opening it up to all beliefs and it was more of a okay listen a you're not going to be persecuted for being Christian anymore that's the first day\nAnd then slowly\nOr he started opening that up and then he started saying well no paganism problem or going to start\nJust allowing everything but now putting paganism down and through the process of the years and so on chained to a point where he says no Christianity is mandatory\n\nIn ways and then you've got people going okay well then I'm just can't take this with me or this with me or this with me doesn't always work absolutely not or their systems that ... are polluted in perverted because they brought things into Christianity\nAbsolutely but that's where\nDiscernment comes from and my purpose for bringing these things up in pointing them out is or even the word holy day um has been muted to holiday and there are things like blessings and the term holy itself that really date very far back\nPre dating Christianity and the if you start just throwing the baby out with the bath water you have problems the bath water is dirty the baby baby is clean\nAnd you need to look around and see how these things are are interacting in your life if they are neutral or can be neutralized then that's fine\nIf they're infiltrating by way of someone with an agenda or something or these types of things than yes you are to defend yourself and your faith or against those kinds of interruptions but many of these things from thousands of years of filtering\nHave become a nine\nYou\nKnow uh you ... the the the practices that these things once held have nothing to do with it a child is not running around in a costume of their favorite superhero thinking that they are courting off demons and spirits and ghosts as they dance around a bonfire\n\nIt's simply them trying to get candy and dressing up when it\nSays in scripture that you were created in the image of God some argue that that is uh that you have intellect will and emotion others would say that you're very creativity of a desire to be creative or create and build in any way shape or form is antithetical\nTo the devil himself who wishes to destroy so when\nYou find children having a desire to create or be creative is something that should be encouraged\nOthers will look at Halloween and the concept of death and mayhem and say oh well it deals with the death or death or a skeletons and I've always appreciated the the the look of our brothers and sisters that\nHave cultures rooted in a in Mexico and their uh their understanding or they're at peace with the concept of death and they celebrate the day of the dead not as something that worships the dad\nBut as something it's kind of like all saints day where it's a time to look back on the those from your family that have passed on and to celebrate their life\nBut it's done with him injuries are the imagery of skulls and you know people get confused what is this about and it's it looks I'm dark and sinister and really it's not it's a it's about life\nEven the place where I died ... is the place of the skull Christians are taught not just here he who can kill the flesh but he can kill the spirit or both\n\nAnd so that that the concept of combating a the fear of death is a scriptural one\n\nSo I walked to the valley of the shadow of death I sure fear no evil\n\nAnd that kind of attitude is can be healthy and productive now as an adult and you need to have discernment in all things and apply it to your life in the life of your children absolutely\nAnd find where that line is for you and how you would want to practice or something like this but I Will tell you that when you\nWhen you kind of sequester a child from something that's going on in the world and it's not explained properly or it's just well that has demonic roots kid doesn't even know what a pagan is or any of those things\nThen you end up cutting off a much more than you think you are because I environmentalists them yes on one side you can say I'm being a good Stuart\nWith the world that God has given but on the other side\nEarly begins worshipping and taking care of the world\nSo is it about taking care of the world it's good or bad or is it about while you're taking care of the world and to who that chlorine goes these are the things that I think our last in these battles of well it's just bad or it's just good God is just as good\nAnd there are a lot of Christian liberties and a lot of battling that went on and and the church of ... and ... should I eat this if it was the given the idols or a\nSacrifice to idle should do this and in many cases it's like eat what you want if a glorified God you're fine and then on some cases if there's somebody who's going to stumble by the very fact that you're doing that you don't want to cause the lesser minded as scripture says are those that no less\nUm to fall but\nYou also want to educate them in educating them then they won't stumble on the smaller stones\nThey'll see the bigger picture\nAnd that's my only hope here it's not to champion a particular holiday or to tear another holiday down it's to be reasonable\nI partially because if when you're reasonable others will see you're reasonable and they'll believe what you say about your faith and about God if they're non believers if you're unreasonable they will reject what you say and what you do in your belief in God

just like anything else it fun for the kids I mean unless you're warship them and then people if they think they're evil the mask and whatever that would uh like they go to in golf I don't believe it goes to ... which is good stuff like that anyway\nUh well I Know he was shipped them and put them before God or it's just a holiday for the kids\nI think that as well said I think there's a lot of people that ah I see it for something that it's not or that it was once\nUm but it doesn't involve those things in truly it lands on the parents to make the decision in the life of their child a but be careful you there are things you know we see on the program often that their wounds you bandage and wounds you amputate so it doesn't pervert the rest of the body\nAnd there are some things you want to cut from your life possibly and say well we don't want this we don't want that but there's also things that you can um re brand restructuring away um that are fun and healthy and I can have a good time and I speak to many many Christians\nAnd inevitably you ask them and they say well I just don't want to do on a child as well where you are brought up in a Christian households yes but my parents let us celebrate it and\nHow long have you been worshipping the devil now\nIt's it's not necessarily the way the path goes\nAnd you want to protect your children to the best of your ability but also keep in mind that if you're over sensitive on things that are benign or neutral or that you can um [noise] uh you can put an understanding of Christianity on it\nThen sometimes it confuses and causes great rebellion and that's not to say to be a lukewarm wishy washy upbringing 'cause you don't want the kids rebel it's not my point\nPoint is that uh make sure that the things that you're trying to cut from their life that you make a good case for it and that it's understood across the board otherwise truly is they\nGet older and start doing their own research search and seeing that there's all kinds of things in your home that have a pagan origin and customs and things like that then\nAnd then they'll start turning it back on you and\nOf course that will be a problem\n[noise]

like going to a movie with friends or mowing the grass or everything like that you know\nWell there's it really comes down to if you hear a a child talk about their parents and you asked that child will you know would you give your life or your parent\nThey'd say yes\nBut you asked that same child if bill\nMow the lawn or do the dishes and they'll go oh I don't want to and Christians do this sometimes too it's like they you would lie lay down your life for your God if necessary but you won't live your life for God and that means every little boring thing\nYour parents don't want to be a you know you to be at their foot every ten seconds going gosh you're the greatest parents and the whole wide world ... they want you expressing that in the things that you do showing them that the life\nThey've given you will be a life that's productive\nAnd righteous and ah with filled with purpose and God wants the same thing yes God wants you to worshipping God once you in church God wants you to pray God wants you to do all those things that have become religious in nature\nBut truly God wants you to live a life I'm\nA vet is filled every single day we'd creativity with exploration

finances is what brought this to the surface oh yeah oh that breaks my heart to thought that something might even well\n... okay\nLet 'em\nChanging the thing is that she's in a vault in um a major church and we weren't involved that made your church together and then since she made the decision that are divorced me and stuff it's a piece of\nThe church seem it seems like back them up but they kind of\nMake a statement that families forever you know a lot of their teaching about family forever and out of the good part of the church for many years and and I haven't had any contact with these people and I and I I've tried to go back a couple of I just I just didn't feel like I Want it\nKind of thing now so ... so I kinda feel bad about that my wife and my youngest daughter still do but yeah see and then another whole aspect of this too I mean a couple of years ago I I uh I got a double pneumonia and swine flu and I had died a couple of times on the on life support or ... yeah\nI think uh my goodness so you died a couple of times and ... and and this yeah this is did we speak before no I don't think\n... are you you don't hear that often the whole died a couple of times now when when this occurred uh ... when this occurred ah this is a clinical death rate that they're just stopping in a heartbeat is what you're talking about\nRight yeah the first time it stopped for they fail to Atlanta and a couple of days later the three and a half minutes\nMy goodness so I went and saw my valor\nAnd everything all that stuff [laughter]\nSo you've had your share of some some ugly times some very rough times and you're trying to work yourself through them now\nYeah that's that's ... ... well\nYou're ... the thing that it is about churches is their their community\nAnd unfortunately sometimes in that community\nUm they don't always know how to deal with everything we've come this been running seen throughout the show and started with the concept of Halloween in paganism all these things and what you cut out of your life what you don't sometimes the church\nReally doesn't know how to respond to certain\nUgly parts of life or the divorce and things like that or even on the death of someone or strange circumstances whatever it is and they just\nThey they don't run to the aid of and this is an old churches but some do and this may or may not be the church that you were attending a in the case but in that case as well but really um the important thing is for you to find\nA church to grow and to be rooted in regardless of whether it's that church you were originally in or not\nIs there a\n... ... what is your goal in all of this what are you trying to trying to get the family back together or are you trying to make yourself whole again what is your goal\nI think the primary thing would be to make myself all yet so I can get the family back together we I have four children too so so we're just we didn't just screw up their lives you know their friends all of our friends all over relative uh thirty one years building up\nSo it's a lot it's a lot of you know ... the crazy thing is that you know it it uh\nIt it I think there's some way could be a man that I just don't know how to get it all back together and\nYou know it it gets along with I think the long term plan but they are and I just don't feel comfortable going back to that church right now and that they have it and you know like I say they haven't reached out one diamond said hey you know how you doing you know it's like\nReally as in large church very larger yeah that happens at the very\nLight as many many of them you know so it though and it's like I said it's\nA and there's you know there is a factor that churches is I've always been turned off about a hypocritical ... some people it's like it's okay you shouldn't do that than I should do this and then teen ... you're saying it\nTo find a middle road because everything you do not always so that's a terrible thing you know just by watching you know you know Halloween movie or something you know that's not like a year the devil worship or you're you're just joining a movie or something you\nKnow I find that the church or likes the pendulum swing hard left or hard right and\nAnd that doesn't mean to be mediocre eh I say in scripture if you're lukewarm ... out of my mouth it's not not to be warm it's a matter of finding that balance gym it's a matter of saying okay well\nAh where is a place of health for me and something that will not distracted take me away from the gospel or my face and\nIn in your circumstances a\nIn going through pain or a a divorce or any of these things can be quite distracting and God's desire is always for reconciliation when possible if your wife's not here to talk um and speak for herself\nBut I'd be I'd be curious to see a gym if your wife was on the phone and I asked her why you guys got a divorce what\nDo you think the top three reasons she would

every single Sunday right here and the answer your questions and talk about things that truly matter in life\nAnd the afterlife if you have a question or a dealing with the theology or you're going through something right now I'd love to talk to you or anywhere in the usa Dell eighty seven seven holy host\nUh for those of you like it plain and simple numerically it's eight seven seven for six five nine for six seven\nWe were talking with Scott Scott you're still with us yet you were saying that you've been married for ten years\nYeah about ten years okay and the past four or so um three or four years\nWe were four years your wife is slowly had less and less interest in sex and you say other than that the relationship is great you guys are you know go out to see movies you hang out together you go on vacations together but no sex right\nHas your wife prior um had any medical issues at all or changed medications or anything like that\nWell yeah I mean she's she's got some medications like come to the things that ... and\nThings of that nature which which should be intervening that she had some hormone issue isn't really\nA pleasure issues\nAnd so forth um but she'd never been a you know real sexual type of a creature um\nSo going into this marriage or when you guys were first married she wasn't even\nThere is terribly interested in sex or yeah she\nShe she was not a short in a while yet like some of the ladies at a\nWhile well oh okay [laughter] okay to cut\nThat I that might be filed under a TMI maybe but I appreciate the inside um ... ... the reason why ask these things is not a medical show of course we look at the spiritual aspects of things from biblical in mainstream Christian a perspective but\nI asked those things because all of that kind of points to the direction of\nUm you know where one might look for answers in something like this now when it first started you say three or four years ago what would be the excuse or the response to\nUm uh you becoming amorous and I'm approaching her sexually\nFor her for her when she just shut you down cold I have a headache I've got to rearrange my sock drawer ... what kind of risk I mean it\nIt it would just be just about anything you know it would be you know uh [laughter] not feeling well too much stress at work or you know kind of thing\nOr even when we get vacations or whatever it into it landed on her cycle so to see those kind of issues that you come up with and you know we've been rebuilding our relationship uh slowly so we've had some upside down then\nOkay well what what are those ups and downs when you say you're rebuilding what are you rebuilding what was torn down or broken\n... well I you know I had a sense from a previous marriage to live with us for that not a previous marriage but I Do find it and that caused a little bit of a different opinion\nA year ago I used to drink at it and I haven't drank and stuff like that so there there there were some of the issue is that\nWhat kind of drink or were you uh were you mean drunk\nI'm sloppy\nSloppy okay yeah an embarrassing drunk okay yeah yeah and it it did in\nThat was done in front of her quite often\nUh yeah she she well when I did that but at the same time you know she loves me and a journalist her and I went and took care of that that that's part of that and you know that that issue certainly now that that some some time ago\nOkay and uh you know I'm In\nThe reason why I bring that up those cuts so you know is that um sometimes uh in relationships you get in different modes and let's say she you know of course she loves you you love her and she's in that mode of taking care of you when your sloppy drunk\nAnd it takes for energy and all of those things that sometimes the resentment builds up and then when you were well or your partner can become quite distant\nI'm working through those things when those memories or gosh remember this or that as they won start to learn new you and have a new you works and healthy works\nAnd all of those things and they can be resentful of well how come how come you didn't do it sooner or do you not care or there's a lot of things the fiber of my ... uh um the illnesses let's put it that way they'll miss is\nThat you named to four or five of them actually um that might play a part or even hormones\nI'm specifically some of them deal with pain some of them do not to shiver comment about a pain\nQuite a bit I'm ... and so on [noise] but I don't think that that's the I ... I guess my concern is\nYou know married but her fiber miles yeah\nDoes that does that manifest itself in pain yes okay and that's been since you didn't\nMiss\nOkay and the hormone thing that that concerns me quite a bit the hormone you said there were hormone issues and she on medication", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jesus Christ Show (PRN)", "city": "Mobile", "day": "28"}
