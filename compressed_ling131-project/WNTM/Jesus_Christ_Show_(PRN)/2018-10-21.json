{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "In twenty twenty including the the rights of the United States Senate here in Alabama\nOr listening to people in Alabama or guest Republican former state representative Paul DeMarco\nSo I'm a big issues coming up in the state or in the closing weeks of the campaign or one of them are turned out to be the ah pardon parole board uh and uh we had some major developments there are a lot of concerns\nAbout a large number of violent criminals coming up for early Paroles and a governor ivy stepped in and took action\nEverybody needs to pay attention to what's going on in Montgomery with the um parole board Alabama present parole board there has been a lot\nOf I don't know if you want to use the word mistakes but the way the parole board has operated allowing individuals violent\nOr individuals folks convicted felons felonies to get out of jail earlier than they should have been allowed to get out of jail a there was an incident where an individual was paroled a no win kept up with him in a murder terrible murder three individuals and governors bill\nThe governor has stepped in a changed or the chair of the board has I'm asked for a freeze on releasing and uh for the parole board to come back\nWe need to go beyond that I I personally think that we need to have a brand new parole board I think the government needs to ask for a fresh start\nA this has not been fair to a victims and I'll tell you give a lot of credit to vocal the victims advocacy group too early stepping in with the governor and attorney general but this needs to be addressed\nI think just a temporary suspension is not is not enough in my eyes I I think we need to see a new parole board I think we need to see a new a leadership or in the the um at the parole board and I also would like to see the legislature\nCome in and really or take a handle take a look at this entire way the parole board operates [noise]\nUh you know including having a special committee meeting to address to have the parole board come before the legislature and address these issues and then let's see some legislation in next year's legislative session to resolve this I Am not a confident that\nBased on what the current parole board and the way they're operating that unless the legislature steps in with legislation to permanently fix these problems that we may go back to where we weren't before\nOr the governor and state attorney general Steve Marshall went to the border to ask them questions about the Jimmy Spencer case to what you referred\nHe was released and went on to murder a child and to women voters vote\nAnd the governor said she was very disappointed in the answer she received from the board and she painted a picture of a highly dysfunctional system let's listen\nTo the lower level made a decision recommended go a little bit chain and when the file that simple and members lay up for it and that just makes it\nAll the Marco you were chairman of the house Judiciary Committee during your time and the legislature uh what is your view of the situation that the Alabama board of pardons and\nParoles did this has been such a scandal that we need a fresh start with the ... and in every listener to this session\nNeeds to make it clear to the leadership of the state of Alabama and and I I Do think that the governor and the attorney general did do what they needed to do to to start making some changes but I think to really complete the process you need a new leadership\nAt that bored and you need the legislature to step in and by statute make changes to the white is bored operates it is not working this is a complete failure of the system\nAnd and it's not fair to the victims of some of these individuals and again thank you to vocal and uh what they have done to I'm really get this addressed and bring this to the attention of leadership the state of Alabama\nA stunning development and perhaps we'll see some movement on that in the upcoming legislative session\nWe also saw hurricane Michael effect part of the state uh especially farmers around the wire grass a lot of crops wiped out the governor asking for emergency agricultural aid from the Trump Administration and of course all of this happening against the backdrop of an election\nBoth here and in Florida where you have that state's governor Rick Scott in a very competitive\nThe Senate race against democratic incumbent Bill Nelson what are some of the ways that natural disasters have had an impact not only on the people\nInvolved but perhaps on a campaign uh this late in an election cycle will people judge leaders\nOn how they operate not only on a day to day basis but when there's a crisis and and we've seen that around the country um when you had Hurricane Sandy you've seen blizzards in Chicago that has affected mayoral races in Chicago\nOr you you look at what has happened around the country when it comes to natural disasters and you expect to have you looked at Hurricane Katrina what happened with the governor of Louisiana\nUm and the way she handled it as opposed to the governor of Mississippi during Hurricane Katrina\nSo people or or you know rightly should look at their leaders when there's a a natural disaster of some sort of Christ said you know are they stepping up and leading the state the way we expect them to do a you know more than ... that's when you need to step up so what do you say somebody should be judged politically during disaster you know that's what people do\nAnd it can have an effect in if if there is effective leadership that take care of those that are in need it is reflected in the ballot box but if there's a perception that uh this was not handled the way they would expect to the leader is also handle it the ballot box so hopefully we'll see\nA you know our prayers to all those owned the the the coast of Florida but also\nUm farmers in South Alabama in South Georgia whose crops were destroyed by the hurricane\nAnd a number of folks who lost their homes and also that the loss of life so as we go to the next to a non just weeks but months in recovery will be thinking of all those on the coast [noise]\nOur guest has been Republican former state representative Baltimore girl we've been discussing some of the latest developments here in Alabama ended up in Washington

D. three mobile\nHeating rally is for a pair of political rivals I'm Pam who south Fox News well accusing President Trump shredding an African value is former vice president Joe Biden fired a crowd in Nevada where Democrats have a chance to flip a Senate seat in next month's midterms it's time to get up with\nKnowing full well on Sunday night I'm going to walk into the California lottery office with my hundred million dollar winning tickets [noise] I I Know that full well in advance of them got this money coming to me than what am I really ... what am I really given up myself knowing full well that I'm going to really make out you know like gangbusters and\nTruly an in would that analogy you're absolutely right\nSo so so what did Jesus really give up a what a God really give up because if you died but then you came back two days later nobody else is able to do that\nWell here's the thing um and there's not going to be an analogy is using you know joking logic that old analogies break down not very funny joke but to ... they think it's hilarious though all analogies breakdown that means that if you extrapolate extrapolating extrapolate eventually every now and she's going to fall apart because\nThey're just analogous they're not truly the exact same thing so um I understand is that\nThe biggest problem with the man is it is it deals with God is that man continues to make God a bigger him\nRather than got so when you try and answer more strictly attach Mike attributes to God there's always going to be a translation problem\nNow you have God that cramps deity into a a human vessel and puts it on earth for thirty three some odd years\nAnd ah there's a great purpose behind that and there's going to be some that you know here and some that you'll know later I'm a depending on where you stand with God\nBut if you were to think of it this way Mike um have you ever done any jail time never would you ever want to know OK course not good answer now if you were to uh go to jail when you were guilty it would stink wouldn't it\nSure but imagine going to jail if you were innocent\nWould there not be a greater a sacrifice if you were innocent and in jail versus being guilty and in jail they both have the sacrifice of not having freedom and all of that but there's an extra element\nThat if you were truly innocent Mike to be sitting in that jail cell cell would be a a something greater than just somebody who's guilty correct correct okay now if you take that and you extrapolate the fact that God he's innocent and perfectly just\nAnd took taking on the sins of the world is the sacrifice everybody gets caught up in the death the death and the resurrection was about the payment for you that that so you have the opportunity\nA to a reunite and be bridged with God but the pain or what took place is something you will never understand because you can never be innocent\nNever people refer to children is being innocent children or even innocent there is never a point where you and your life ever have been truly innocent my I have\nNow that the the sacrifice it's taking place you see is the physical this is the anthropomorphic language that I was talking about humans tend to look at that and go wow that's great I Would love to be able to die and then resurrect because then I could do whatever I Want it it's not that way\nIt's not like a superhero type situation this is God taking on the sins that other people did\nInto his body which is now flash\nAnd consuming that it's nothing you could ever compared to you because you're going hey it's a magic trick and that's not that's not a sacrifice Mike you give money every month to your landlord\nWhether that be a ... a person or whether that'd be a bank\nAnd that's a sacrifice even though you will make that money up the next month standing on your analogy you do make that money back\nNow you don't make the same money back but you make the money back because you work for it it's still going to be a sacrifice the the potency of what took place won't ever be understood by man because they'll always look at it as well you got your life back no\nThat's not what took place in that sense\nThrough physically taking on an spiritually taking on the debt and the sins of the entire world\nThere is nothing that you could ever analogize nothing that you could ever compare or truly understand the loss which is why you use money as a reference or being able to get the life back\nAnd I can I jump in here absolutely\nUm I mean I grew up in the Christian faith and I mean I I've heard these statements and sentiments in various various agree button I still keep coming back to it if\nI understand the preaching but I don't understand how that didn't explain it this way God could have looked around and said okay I made all these people that I Love and they said they're not going to get into haven't [noise]\nUm so I Need to create this way that they can get to heaven you know he could you know powerful you could have just said I forgive you all you still have your free well\nNo no no no no no no no Mike because once again you're looking for the quick way out that's a human way out in just ... well I mean there was an option\nAnd no no no but it's not a God it's Mike option it's not a gun option and the reason why it's not a God option is because it's not just it just clears the plate\nThere is a balance of justice that is here that people don't understand it is the ability to sin that causes the distance God doesn't just want closeness it's not like oh gosh you just want you to come home at any cost you know it's that it's gotta be through this balance of justice might\nDie out it how did you dying do anything that's what I don't understand people say well Jesus died for me [laughter] okay well what the\nPay the price it made it just you couldn't just get in because ah well we'll just it's not waving a debt see the debt still hangs this is the human mentality the human mentality is if I gamble all my money\nAnd someone else pays for on good but in the world of true justice that balance is still not paid because it wasn't paid by you\nSo in this particular case God takes it on and when I ask you to hang on tight uh Mike as we come across this break 'cause I Want to talk to you some more but you can't just pay for it like that it's not about wiping it clean it's that it has to be wiped clean\nJustly [noise]\n\n\nThat's great will return a moment to be a part of the seven so radio news radio limited in\nThe backyard looking great Rob

my church really around ... and the congregation that church with restructuring pastors in ... and now some of those wrongdoing or returning back to the church and my question is how do I have fellowship at these people I I can forgive him as I'm called to do but I don't trust them and I feel so protective of my church\nOK rightly so I'm ... ... they're running your church in in what way\nUm you don't give names and super specifics but\nThat the pastor was not to put it in a way should have been and um it was found to be that they really did wrong and and that we had to we had to restructure because people were willing to step down to the the church and to keep the congregation I'm intact\nOkay so this was a big deal is change the ... the entire structure of the church was changed but horrible and the people that have the problem\nOr they\nThey created their own church OK and many of them left that and now it's kind of cutting back then [laughter] almost two years okay so there's a lot of it that it's still there and they'll feel that\nOkay but the but this is the beauty of of this type of relationship if people can make mistakes I guarantee you if you look down on the pencils in your house Tracy they ever racers as well right um everybody's going to make mistakes\nThe the purpose of the body of Christ is not to this is you know there's\nYou've got the reformation and you've got this split of the church and you've got to know Catholics and Protestants and they butt heads on occasion and then the Protestants are making little factions of Protestantism and they've got groups here in groups there now they start butting heads and it continues to go on and it's the most frustrating part\nA of Christianity\nWhen you were you looking at it so the purpose of it all is for you to all remain tied to the essentials\nAnd those are central is or who do you see that I Am a mother the trinity all of these things the resurrection these are the essential or the face the rest is peripheral garbage it's just stuff\nStuffed with the ... that you're gonna have to get through it's like in a marriage or any relationship um the essential or important that you love and that you trust each other and that you are are focused on the same purpose of happiness and a gross\nSo in the church you have to be single minded and those things about God not just the church\nAnd if somebody makes a mistake and there's a huge division and there are wounds and there are scars and then they come back you have to at least allow that you're going to take place you have to\nAnd many many have come to a third to a church and if you ask for forgiveness or have going forward and acknowledge good at what they've done but I'm asking about the ... not\nWell then you confront them and and that's my question I have\nAbsolutely go up to them and say listen but you put it on you ... them it's not about them this is about you wanting to heal through it um and don't put it like they're doing well you say listen I I'm having a real issue with this and we were here and we stood here and don't feel that you're better than them 'cause you stood\nBecause everybody will make a mistake right but it's that you're there and you had to watch it and in your pain to buy it\nAnd and each taught that out with them so you feel like\nYou know the church needs an apology or something like that but talk it out to be brothers and sisters in this face and and not be pushing against each other so much uh that the division that happened before could have been theological now it's emotional political get over that move forward\nI appreciate you taking the time to listen to the show every single Sunday right here I tell friends and family about it

G. three mobile\n\nWhat to do about Saudi Arabia I'm Pam who sales\nFox News President Trump says he'll work with Congress on the U.S response to the death of journalist ... ... says the Washington Post columnist died inside its consulate in Istanbul, Turkey during a fistfight\nThat faces the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen interestingly\nEnough that word evidence there that's translated as evidence means truly proof or proving\n\nAnd what kind of faith I call you to have is one reason of understanding that doesn't mean that there are things that you can't know scripture says the secret things belonged to the lord\nBut there are things that you can know should know it should pass on\n\nWhich is a wonderful thing it is that which comes at the end of reason\n\nJoins dot regs seeker so the faith is a reasoning trust trust which reckons thoughtfully confidently upon the trustworthiness of God\n\nThere's nowhere in scripture where you will find God calling you to a blind face to an unreasonable faith\n\nAs Christians you've been bullied you've been mocked in the air it's been a straw man set up and your name\nAnd continually burned with the idea that your face lax reason\n\nThat your belief system is archaic outdated without intellect ...\nI'm passe\nI assure you is not Archie Bunker\nSet on a on the family many many years ago that face you know face that's when you believe in something you know downright is not true\n\nAnd unfortunately the world tends to see Christianity is that way it's not that there aren't people with that have been gifted with a simple face\n\nA faith that can move mountains that does not need all the articulation and all the understanding but isn't it wonderful how your God sees fit to provide that for those who do need it the intellectual aspect\nIt doesn't replace faith faith will always be there that is that trust that the information is true that is that trust the God is there when you can't see him\nWhen you can't hear him when you can't feel him how many times have you heard on this very program people calling and saying I just can't feel God today\n\nWell God can feel you God Knows you're there\nTo get in that mindset that it's OK want answers to not want to know\nWhy and how things work is okay\nAs long as you know they're going to be some things that you can't know\nWouldn't help you if you didn't know\n\nHow many times have you gone through a trying experience\nOn you\nWhy and you push through faith and trust it and the circumstances changed\nAnd more of what I was going to pass that you were going down now unfolded before you\nThat you looked up and said oh okay I get it now\nThat face at that place of strength when most people see chaos is what separates you having that understanding\n\nThat there's someone transcended the cares that's in control\n\nThat faces powerful and it's real but it's not ignorant\nIt's not stupid or foolish\n\nScripture says that you love your God with all of your head all of your heart and all of your spirit the entirety of who you are your physical nature your spiritual nature your intellectual major all of that\nIs how you love God\nAnd faith plays a part in the entirety of all that is\nBut when you apply face your life you don't feel that it's out of ignorance don't feel that it's out of the lack of knowing that faith is based on your trust and understanding your knowledge of who ... in your life\n\nAnd knowing that I Will never leave you nor for sake you\n\nThat it's the beauty of face there's\nT shirts that read ignorance is bliss faith is not ignorance\n\nIs not running around not understanding\n\nIt's truly burst from knowledge from knowing who got is knowing who got is in your life\n\nHow much better would it be for you to have faith Justin yourself the way others do how would that help you how would you benefit it's not that you don't have confidence in your abilities and your gifts the things that God has given you\nBut those have faith in themselves stopped short\n\nHaving facing the creator that one the one that knows all your nooks and crannies every ounce of who you are and how you work and even more so how you should work\nThat if the person you apply faced it\n[noise] uh\nFor\nFor [noise]\nLandmine man\nJesus Christ will return and I'm going to be hard of a show called\nMorning\nSent me a long way\n\n\nOne end underpaid um hello we knew it\nWe're here to change all day with your cats wouldn't one thousand dollars a chance to win one thousand dollars every hour radio seven ten WNBA ... de\nDe jour for your safety and when I feel I mean it could make it\nRain in front of your least favorite coworkers driven by mobile bay Harley Davidson new ownership you added to the Gulf Coast Vermeer spot for all think Harley Davidson is where you can get a new army for as low as one oh nine month find their events on Facebook there's always a party at\n...

problem\nSame time same place\nAnd you can follow us on Twitter at Jesus' show\nAt Jesus' show\nWe were talking with Jeanie Jeanie there are now your husband or as is having issues with the fact that the babies are born with with disabilities and Pete's on his face\nIs in ... in faith for food but does he have faces they're okay so he wrestles with it doesn't keep them from having faith but it it he wrestles with it\nRight in ... it's very hard and are preparing for somehow I don't know [noise] well I Want to help I I've got ...\nWell it is normal and it is healthy for him to question these things because it shows compassion on his part and and that's a good thing um so the question becomes you know I guess academically it becomes will know why does God allow these things right and not just reach in well it sounds simple\nUm but it's kind of like when you start looking at things that you don't like in the United states and you start going I you know I don't like the way that person thinks oh I don't like the way they act I wish we could just bands that then what ends up happening is what in the United states or the constitution says that once you start banning that than\nThe things you can vote you believe in can be banned as well and it starts this whole cycle right that breaks down the entirety of the system so you have to let people be who they are within reason as long as it doesn't cause danger harm to anyone else you have to allow people to be who they are even if you disagree now you stretch that\nOr to God looking over the universe and everything in it and saying what I Want are creatures that can love and the only way creatures can truly love is to allow them the option not to love\nSo are the only way you can allow creatures truly to love God or anything else the the only reason your husband knows that you love him is because you come home to him every night by choice that you ... if you had a gun to your head it wouldn't be love right you'd just be doing it because he was forcing you so God force people to do right\nIt's no longer doing right it's like the uh\nUh you know putting a murderer in solitary confinement he doesn't murder anymore right he's not good because if you had the opportunity you would murder right so just because uh you know it just because you took\nA the morality out of it or you assume that you you know I keep a this prisoner I'm so we can't kill that he now he's a better person no it just means he doesn't have the opportunity or the choice that's not better that's without any morality so\nGod in order to to create a a creature that has that can truly love has to give them an option not to love so what these creatures do some of them go towards gone\nSeeking God seeking God's will and God's love and loving God and therefore trying to abide by the rules of God which are the rules of the universe truly\nAnd I'm a when it comes to pollution or drugs or things like that um they would uh shun them but then there are those that look to cut corners to make more money to build a their empire to do all kinds of things are to get high to do whatever that\nAh pollutes the genetic line\nAnd then what ends up happening is you have mutations now not seeing the parents of some of a of a disabled child have done something there's themselves you're talking about it could be generations and generations generations of a a a go of people that they don't know\nI'm the purpose of that is to understand that everybody is responsible for one another and in in doing that you know it keeping in mind that there is the percentage\nOf of Americans that are disabled is approximately about Seventeen percent and of that percentage of disabled people about fifty percent of them are born that way so it it it it makes you one say does it is a disabled person worth less than you\nOf course not of course not so what she looks at is the quality well why does this happen at all and and why would you know when we got allow this it has to be allowed in the process of things because in order to eliminate that I'm very boy that possibility would be to have to take away\nThe consequences of anything that people did wrong\nAnd you have to allow consequences in life 'cause that that helps build character it's like um if you think about all the wonderful things in life that you know ability courage all these things\nDo you need those don't exist without adversity do they uh you know a fireman or a firefighter cannot be a hero without a fire or some sort of adversity same with a law enforcement or anything like that so the balance of adversity\nAnd faith in strength and nobility and all these things love versus a indifference or even hate that these things only exist in this world in this way because this is not the best world Jeannie well it's the best way to the best world which is heaven\nYour life back\nGo to operation hope dot org today our callers at four zero for nine four one to nine one

I came to a year ago and has very open hearted and confused and my marriage and that question now a year later um I did leave home for a month and I came back and um [noise] I just wonder where I draw the line um my husband [noise]\nUm hey uh I listen all garlic and have more Helena\nUm he professes to laugh and they said it happy that he really is is this fall and the self destructive and doesn't really respect my opinions and it's really just kind of a written that situation I I just has such difficulty a loving and in a way that that you would\nAnd where to draw the line\nHow long have you guys been together for a long time and when did he started drinking from the beginning [noise] most\nWas drunk when you guys are [laughter]\nMy girlfriend recognized it early on 'em that I never knew what alcoholic in life I never saw it as a\nOkay well I'm Talking about just the the academics of it all you did you see him drunk\nMhm yeah did you see him do stupid things when he was drunk\nI'm meeting okay yeah\nAnd you you needed a formal definition that wasn't good enough for you\nKnow I just didn't I just thought through you know I thought he grow out of it really had to go out\nYou know twenty four years as a long time that I've made excuses I I did a majority of the work at home including the financial than keeping thanks for falling into disrepair of you know I just and I thought all this effort with please and make it more of a part to me that it's not a part\nNo it doesn't sound like you're not even a partner in terms of you know not even a whole human being and he's broken it right but he is broken and he needs help and it doesn't need\nThe help of you turning your head and pretending like it doesn't exist T he needs to be put in to um a system structure that will help and remove this ah from his life\nI'm as a daily practice yes and is he willing to do then is he willing to go to a or\n[noise] if you think that's what I should do I can I can watch it again and we have to counseling and that that he thinks what's so bad you know what's wrong with that it's not so bad that I have a job\nOr steadily yeah yeah and and that's just that it's like no no one dish and you know it's only been that's everything else has been up to me Terry [noise] carry the load and such okay well\nWhat it what it comes down to Lisa is I always prefer reconciliation however if he gets me and he gets hurtful towards you and anyway I don't want you to stay in in a position of being harmed\nBut you see it it's not like throwing up your arms people need to fight for um what they want people need to fight for the relationships that they start you need to fight for your marriage\nAnd by doing that is not just trying to please him is trying to do what's right and that means putting them in a program and having worked up program to its fullest\nA one day to time to give himself clean that's what it means or going through detox or doing whatever he needs to do and if he's not willing to do that that he's not willing to be a participant in the marriage and then there is no marriage to fight for\nBut at this point you've you've got to take a stand and say this is what we need for for this marriage to work you to get healthy and this is the way to do it\n[noise]\nBut Jesus Christ shows will return in a moment to be a part of a show called the symptoms of a whole Rio's

show ... thank you or what an honor to speak to you know it's my pleasure up and help you Jay I have a feel article crush okay and it's a reference to first Corinthians ...\nAnd a verse Nineteen and twenty um and the reason I'm Wondering about if I have a very fundamentalist Christian family\nWho are sometimes they just drives me crazy\nWait whoa this is hard to believe are you saying that there's sometimes there's fundamental Christians that can be oh I don't know pushy yeah ad is really hard to believe that a ... a little I have to say okay\nWell ah some of some of the fate of the things that I've overheard around been directed me for example is that uh [noise] uh\nThe the Hurricane Katrina was God's Ralph put people in the world oh boy I'm the earth is only five thousand years old oh boy I'm dating is the devil cool oh\nBoy oh and I I Will agree that carbon fourteen dating is not the best way to do any more it's gotten better um we have much better tools to to date a scientifically than carbon fourteen but go ahead\nYeah I'm I have one cousin that I Love the early ... who has made statements regarding became very demeaning favor [noise] um and to quote a all the tea to and do it with a bunch of useful varies\nUm it's all a bunch of garbage oh that's a ... who fill the ten year old and probably enough of like school\nAnd we respond to the you know or or educational my wife I have a very important\nFor life and ritual sure ah experiences through our lives and I have a written\nA ham regarding fatter through his response\nOf um uh the wife of the education of garbage and I really made up his talk on the hill and he froze back out of the first print fan of of a chapter one where a verse vie to uh I Will destroy the wisdom otherwise and the clever enough of a clever I Will have a five\nAnd a verse twentieth ends up with has a God made foolish the wisdom of of the world\nIn other words uh educational uh uh equivalent to a clever enough\nAnd I would just like to know what a better or for protection of it is and is there a I Am a figure of truth\nOkay as a Christian and I I feel that my uh you never stop earning a ... sixty seven years old retired that I never spoke up learning um but the other end of life or elsewhere in the Bible that promotes education per se oh\nAbsolutely but let's look at this and let's look at this is big as we possibly can first\nUm I joked with you about uh the fundamentalist because\nThe the the truth of the matter is they're all all kinds of people involved in the body of Christ yeah and I came in I died for every single one of them and there's going to be those that have different hang ups those have different desires of the way they worship\nAnd I poked fun because I think the importance of the ... of Christ and not take themselves seriously but the word of God seriously\nSo I'm saying that I Want Christians to look at themselves and go am I being closed minded to not receive or on my standing firm on a principle that is important because there's a difference you can be ... bull headed\nAnd not receive in that I don't want I don't I don't want that near my name at all I don't want people are associating that with me but what I Do want is somebody who is confident or in their world view and will stand upon that and defend it\nAnd I don't feel now they're not here to defend themselves in all fairness and to ah make their case\nBut in just in the context in which you're telling me I don't feel they're being fair no I I agree with you that's not very fair and there are a lot of Christians that do that that's my hope for this program is to shed light on things and help people reasons through things strangely enough\nThat's directly from scripture scripture says come let us reason together it says to worship God with all of your heart all of your soul and all of your mind a Christian should not have to leave their brain at the door or when they come into the kingdom of God\nNow diverse in which you're referring to is although your um this is a family member\nYeah I'm more of the monitor the three people or are we don't live near them they're all they all live in a A N another state okay now what I Do love your statement earlier that we are truth seekers absolutely that\nThat really ... uh if I listen to that and I have made an impact\nOtherwise who cares then the new ones right now you can you can both be wrong but you can't be right\nThe purpose of truth the scripture throughout you see things where people say God is love

Fox News we part Saudi Arabia's version of what happened to Washington Post columnist Jim ... after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nYeah and and if I may have just real quick the analogy that I've come up with that is if if on friday morning I give somebody all the money that I have uh my name and I gave them give it all to them\nKnowing full well on Sunday night I'm going to walk into the California lottery office with my hundred million dollar winning ticket [laughter] I I Know that full well in advance of them got this money coming to me than what am I really sacrifice what am I really given of myself knowing full well that I'm going to really make out you know like gangbusters\nSurely an end would that analogy you're absolutely right\nSo so so what did Jesus really give up or what it got really give up because if you died but then you came back two days later nobody else is able to do that\nWell here's the thing um and there's not going to be an analogy is using you know joking logic that all analogies breakdown not very funny joke but to ... they think it's hilarious so all analogies breakdown that means that if you extrapolate and extrapolate and extrapolate eventually every analogy is going to fall apart because\nThey're just analogous they're not truly the exact same thing so [noise] um\nI understand is that the the biggest problem with man is it is it deals with God is that man continues to make God a bigger him\nRather than God so when you try and anthropomorphic we attach Mike attributes to God there's always going to be a translation problem\nNow you have God that crammed deity into a a human vessel and puts it on earth for thirty three some odd years\nAnd ah there's a great purpose behind that and there's going to be some that you know here and some that you'll know later I'm a depending on where you stand with God\nBut if you were to think of it this way Mike um have you ever done any jail time never would you ever want to\nKnow OK of course not good answer now if you were to uh go to jail when you were guilty it would stink wouldn't it sure but imagine going to jail if you were innocent\nWould there not be a greater a sacrifice if you were innocent and in jail versus being guilty and in jail they both have the sacrifice of not having freedom and all of that but there's an extra element\nThat if you were truly innocent Mike to be sitting in that jail cell cell would be a a something greater than just somebody who's guilty correct correct okay now if you take that and you extrapolate the fact that God he's innocent and perfectly just\nAnd took taking on the sins of the world is the sacrifice everybody gets caught up in the death the death and the resurrection was about the payment for you that that is so you have the opportunity a to a reunite and be bridged with God but the pain or what took place\nIs something you will never understand because you can never be innocent\nNever people refer to children as being innocent children or even in a sense there is never a point where you and your life ever have been truly innocent my I have\nNow that the the sacrifice it's taking place you see is the physical this is the anthropomorphic language that I was talking about humans tend to look at that and go wow that's great I Would love to be able to die and then resurrect because then I could do whatever I Want it it's not that way\nIt's not like a superhero type situation this is God taking on the sins that other people did\nInto his body which is now flash\nAnd consuming that it's nothing you could ever compared to you because you're going hey it's a magic trick and that's not that's not a sacrifice Mike you give money every month to your landlord\nWhether that be a ... a person or whether that'd be a bank\nAnd that's a sacrifice even though you will make that money up the next month standing on your analogy you do make that money back\nNow you don't make the same money back you make the money back because you work for it it's still going to be a sacrifice deep the potency of what took place won't ever be understood by man because they'll always look at it as well you got your life back no\nThat's not what took place in that sense\nThrough physically taking on an spiritually taking on the debt in the sins of the entire world\nThere is nothing that you could ever analogize nothing that you could ever compare or truly understand the loss which is why you use money as a reference or being able to get the life back\nCan I can I jump in here absolutely um\nI mean I grew up in the in the Christian faith and I mean I've I've heard these these statements and sentiments in various various degrees but I still keep coming back to it if\nI understand the preaching that message but I don't understand how that ... thing and I ... I Would explain it this way God could have looked around and said okay I made all these people that I Love and they send her they're not going to get into haven't [noise]\nUm so I Need to create this way that they can get to heaven you know he could do it all powerful you could have just said I forgive you all you still have your free well\nNo no no no no no no no no Mike because once again you're looking for the quick way out that's a human way out in just ... I mean there was an option and no no no but it's not a God it's Mike option it's not a gun option and the reason why it's not a God option is because it's not just it just clears the plate\nThere is a balance of justice that is here that people don't understand it is the ability to sin that causes the distance God doesn't just one closeness it's not like oh gosh you just want you to come home at

the root of things I Will tell you this\nUm and uh I I Hope\nAnd then I'm fairly confident Michael Colgan sometimes we'll have another chat\nUm my statement stands that to\nAtheism off the isn't without God the belief that there is no God is something that stems from for emotional reasons I think we were just starting to get their unfortunately I'm\nIn order to have a belief like that or to have a belief that stem and forgive me because I Know a Michael's no longer on the air or I don't want to speak for him but I Want you to understand a bigger concepts\nAre I'm not sure that Michael wants answers are necessarily we didn't have the full time to explore all that so um we looked at what we could\nThe thought that an event changes your mind usually is what points to the fact that it's an emotional response nothing intellectual response I Do I Will give you this that the that can they can both play a part do you throw up face\nSeems to be the the thing that goes out the quickest\nAnd so that's unfortunately where we have to leave it\nBut uh we will we will talk again and I just a sink Mike for the spending so much time and hanging over the break to uh to chat with us I Wish it was a little more fruitful but perhaps a next time Rob welcome to the Jesus Christ show\nIdeas here if I got it to eight and with a\nEx roommate who I've known for about Twenty years he started following a a kind of a religious teacher and\nHe went south and for some reason\nHe just stopped paying rent for about three months and more or less I gave him the boot and at the final and and I said we need to talk about the money that you are the guys that whole on running from me every chance he and um\nDo you think he's involved in a cult or something like that or a\nA he's a he's following at some radio right or Waco, Texas okay and I'm very big on a kind of like opposite of concussion stuff okay I'll be a money\nOh so it's not like the health and wealth gospel or the the name it and claim it or is it the label on it\nIt feels like that but it seems a little more rain because basically\nWhat I talk to him and I said we need to sit down and write a corner and my main issues and tried to get a person to me that he won't even meet with me I ... I Can't even wrecked can't even negotiate or even play to\nFind some sort of ...\nYeah or even figure Lucia well anyway I tried to even read them from I'm from the standpoint of our friendship in the back and he opened up the Bible and declare to curse over me from the Old Testament\nWaiting for I don't believe in ... I mean you don't believe in the eight minutes okay good [laughter] if you're going to say I mean he was out the good stuff okay\nHe called me a ... award would write me ... blindness and madness and um and then he basically gotten it on ...\nAnd I don't frankly I use the money I could work come to a solution um I Know there's a guy who is it out on a lot of his met meant if he's propped up by it\nQuite on some issues very um\nWell you're not there to judge is hard but you can judge and obviously this is not a legal show but the uh you can't judge the fairness of ... of the situation and a morally respond you have every right to sue him\nRight I Do have a right to I'm absolutely okay\nI don't think about not bringing a brother or I Know the\nOf that is that in Hebrew to talk about going to your brother first and explaining the situation then secondly you you bring that yeah obviously that was done and then and then you can bring it to any outside a source that is necessary and this you know the Christians make mistakes and Christians do stupid things and it's even questionable as to who is following particularly now anyways\nBut I'm the you're still accountable\nThis is the thing that's important it's it's it's it's about can you forgive it sure you can forgive the debt if you feel like it um but I'm not sure who's going to learn or who who gains from that\nUh the purpose of this is that uh to know that God is adjust God and so it's not just about this going away but that there's justice done so uh if you feel that you've been wronged and the you know judicial system of the United states of America feels that he's in the room and then you you\nFile a lawsuit and see what comes to that but that whole the point of the scripture is listen as Christians you you you are bound by the laws of the land and you're bound by the laws of God\nLook to the laws have got first\nTo see if there's a way for you can write to to reconcile what's taking place in to do it that way first and foremost\nIf not if he ignores you if he runs from you if he doesn't return your calls these types of things than he is the ones who is ah putting in a position or Christians are not supposed to be wishy washy or you know spineless wimps", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jesus Christ Show (PRN)", "city": "Mobile", "day": "21"}
