{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "Like in the case of Michael Jackson I don't know that that night that he set out\nTo kill himself he just he had been over medicated and it's happening with the help of others doctor who I I don't know if he met well or not but Conrad Murray I guess wasn't he didn't do it right and Michael Jackson passed away and then there's been others who they on their own get a store medication they do it and\nYou ask yourself what leads them to that point where they think that's the solution\nBecause it's it's a form of self medication in order to deal with the pain they want to nominate pain temporarily but unfortunately when the drugs where else the pain still there because they haven't dealt with the core issue that caused a pain in the first place\nRight I've often heard it said suicide is a very permanent solution to a temporary problem\nIn a particularly disturbing trend America's teen suicide rate is among the highest in the world it seems that young people who have everything to live for are increasingly committed coming to the conclusion that their life is is worthless or it's so painful there's no way out why is this such a such a rapid thing with young people\nWell we'll go back to a lot of the\nAh social media and that was in the next question yeah social media is is instantaneously so you have more incidents of bullying and we also have what we call it a professor\nIs social comparison theory so if you had a low point and then you turn on Facebook or Instagram and you see people having a good time and understand that a lot of times that's what people are trying to present mhm that their life is a lotta people compare that\nBut on the on the internal part of their suffering\nAnd so seeing a lot of the the social media people being happy and so forth it caused a lot of internal paying with people you know so I think what's happening with that generation as soon as they are in that social media world this kind of\nBringing a lot bullying has always been around but now you have different forms of it and social media allows it to be people can happen to have a computer and\nAnd then it hurts people it's almost soft\nBullying because if you you go on line and you're lucky you never have a picture itself well here I Am I'm a self eating potato chips watching TV again don't usually do that but the new here's my new car my new girlfriend my new house and so you start to compare your life to that of what you're seeing there with your friends and and your\nYour neighbors and you go my gosh I was terrible I don't have a new girlfriend a new car I knew how what's wrong with me and I could see where people can get very depressed by by those things very depressed\nAnd and and it can cause a it can bring up some on one at issues for example or if you had an ex and you saw him on social media and they were happy and and you're not in a good space it could take some of your\nIssues a little bit further because you're not able to kind of deal with and so I think the social media the Internet accessibility to to to information that can cause more incidents where people can have a incidents of mental illness or suffer from\nDr more do you think and I realize it's somewhat almost antithetical to what we've been talking about bringing awareness but\nDo you think that there is because of all the attention is being paid is it causing I guess for lack of better where to copycat effect where people especially young people look and say\nNo one's paying attention to me I Am going to do this thing so that people will remember me and at least they'll they'll remember in a positive way and because of all the attention that a lot of people are getting now\nIt's almost causing people to think well if I Can't get the attention any other way\nI'll I'll just kill myself do you do you think that's happening\nYeah a lot a lot of that is happening a lot of people\nProbably just trying to like you say the attention seeking behaviors they're trying\nTo trying to tell people and show them and that's where we can go back to getting some help a lot of times people act out when they're and suffering so that's why you can see a radical change in people's behavior\nWhen your friends your spouse or someone in your life is dealing with something they they're they're really looking for attention they are saying look at me I'm hurting\nAnd so they want to show you that and then like you said with a copycat those are people unfortunately that think that is the only way out and so they're saying hey I gives no one is paying attention to me why I'm here so ... ... ...\nIt's the ... I think about because it's like you will get a veteran but it'll be post mortem you won't be around yes you know people will remember you but\nYou know it's that's why I I sometimes wonder with those things like you'll see like somebody who was in high school and and they commit suicide and they dedicate the yearbook to them and I sometimes wonder if that the right way to do things because does that actually given to that and and in doing so create more of the problem\nYeah and there's a psychology is you know we kind of look into that and we're saying that you know it was a certain way the terminology and suicides change if you noticed people will say a person who lost their life to suicide is kind of given in a different way of saying that committed suicide it's a legal things behind why they happen as well but\nIs more than that the person was suffering\nAnd they lost their life to suicide or the lack of so\nAnd I've always heard that if a person you know starts to talk about suicide that that's kind of a warning sign right there that's that's time for you to to seek help for that person isn't it\nYeah but but the thing about it is like I tell people is that\nLike us in the ... you know the person well enough so\nLike we are trained to when they come to us we can you talk therapy and we can use a certain suicide assessment to determine that but what I tell people is is that you can see it and like if you are individual individualistic so I might be dealing with something and you say well he's going through a hard time\nBut when you see it with your friends you can see a radical behavior not people do change and they go through different phases ally but a radical change is is was noticeable so\nAnd they tend to not want to seek help so that's why it's important for people around them just kind of help them because when they are to harm themselves not only themselves but for other people you've got to got to say hey at this point they're not safe for themselves so we got to give you\nAnd Dr more do you ever find a situation where somebody might be reticent to come and seek help on someone's path because they're afraid might damage a friendship or or otherwise you know I don't well I don't want I Know my\nMy brother I Know my friend is is hurting afraid they might do something but if I if I tell someone they're going to know I told and I don't want to damage that relationship is is that a real issue\nYeah there's a real issue and and actually what I tell people is because I go around and do presentations and people say you cannot make anyone get help they say is your friend is Doug how can we get him some help and I say well if you love that person enough I Would love you more\nTo try to get you help so I understand that the conflict and they might be a little upset but you got a little bit more because there's some point they might be a danger to themselves to other people and they they don't have the cognitive skills in order to process was going on and at that point the threat to themselves and possibly other people as well\nAnd Dr ... here in the state of Alabama mental health has never been a very high priority from an economic standpoint\nI what what are the resources available to people living in and we're reaching people for immobile to the wire grass to the shows what are some resources in the state people have at their disposal to to help whether they're seeking help themselves or they know someone\nThat was a good question because throughout the state they have\nThey have a lot of resources available they have private practice obviously but they also have\nFree resources to people who can't afford it so if you and your city you can go to the uh the clinic or you can go to the county courthouse and they have referral is a free services as well as paid services and if you have insurance you can just call your insurance company and they have a list of providers in your area that you can call\nAnd tell them specifically what you're dealing with and they can connect you with the local provider\nDr Marwan thank you so much for spending your time with us or for more on the air more

happen you know and there's no guarantee even known you really are sharing things happen\nAnd so it's like\nOn a on a daily basis like almost like why bother I Know it's going to come out I Believe you know [noise] but if I have a daily communication and then these excruciating things happen\nI don't see the point that just rather know that it's going to come out okay and you know not really fuss with it [noise]\nWell so you're saying you don't want to have communication with God because you don't think it's going to change the outcome\nWill I Believe that the outcome is going to be okay you know based on my salvation based on everything that the word has done for me\nOkay then that's fair enough but ... but we're not ever relationship while you're here\nIt really hurts what does it well you know\nIt's like\nThere I Am going through something that is excruciating in it it's still excruciating and that doesn't get taken away but you know\nThe building the relationship with God is not to take away the bad things in your life but things will continue to happen to have the pillar to lean on and to have that strengthen the promise that bolsters you the builds you up in a way to be able to take those trials or\nThose Shakespearean slings and arrows that you take on every day\n[noise] [noise] well when you said being my pillar you know I think of the lord as my pillar in knowing that\nI Will be in the end everything's gonna come out okay and when I Am in heaven everything will be okay but it's really hard when I'm going through something and it's so painful\nTo connect because it doesn't make it any less painful you know\nI mean I don't just leave it at all it's just\nI don't want things that aren't experience things that are that are horrible from time to um well the beach so horrible it's like it's okay if they happen but you know I just needed to not maybe the so horrible sometimes\nWell God is not anesthesia God is there not to ...\nTo numb you from the things in this world as a matter of fact it's not just about the promise at the end otherwise why did got put you here\nThere's\nThere's things to learn here and part of the learning process is learning to rely on God to lean on God through times of pain if you're not doing that\nYes it retards the the relationship and I and I know the you're going ... you're you have there's this disconnect in\nIn your logic there's some a disconnect in their in what you're doing now I realize you said your an abuse survivor\nA that was at the hands of a a parent\nUh there were a number of things that were going on and there was a hazing during my school years in there with some incest\n[noise]\nI actually think the hazing was worse [laughter] [noise]\nIn in that but when you're dealing with a peers in one case and then dealing with uh people that you should trust\nThat skews how you see life most certainly yeah\nI got transcends those things and often because of the term you know a godfather God dishonor these types of things those terms that people can apply them\nAre in those common roles in life and when there's problems in their childhood whether it'd be with a print a parent or something like that that it does make that family structure skewed and makes it difficult to see some times and to connect with God\nBecause of that but you're reasoning\nThat you don't want to connect with God because there's problems in the world on the day to day basis I'm just not sure\nWhat that means\nWell what am I relying on the lord for I we I ... I already know [noise] you know that it's going to come out in the end but\nWhat is he doing for me now if I'm going through something that is excruciating now that he's not anesthesia so one of my turning to him for\nFor strength for the ability to get through it for understanding if there's something to understand or\nEven better to direct you away from things that might cause that because there may be things that you bring into your life as well in addition to the garbage that comes by way of someone else or someone else's decision or whatever\nBut you have got in your life actively as a participant to help guide you away\nFrom things that might be a problem or painful to to help you as an alarm system to alarm your body\nYour senses your spirit when you're getting into areas that might not be safe and or good to comfort you and give you strength in the areas that you can't control when there's pain something to to give you to to dip into that hope\nOf the promise of having to dip into that hope here on earth and utilize that to build you strength during those times to get you into the times of normalcy or into a time of peace to get you through that to know that you're not alone\n\nYeah yeah it it yeah\nSo you're saying why would you reject those things why would you not want those things in your life ... granted as they said\nThat is not anesthesia got is not there to numb you to life but it doesn't mean that got I mean friends do the same thing for his help guide you friends comfort you two times of pain are you going to reject everybody in your life\nBecause pains going to be there that doesn't make sense why would you do that with God\nIf you wouldn't do that with regular relationships do not call people when you're in pain do not have friends that you lean on or people that you trust\nNo\nWell then that's that's the problem you don't have it in your life in any way shape or form\nI get\nI guess you know nobody can extra anything right\nWell it's not about fixing things\nYou're human you're broken by definition life hurts\nIt does you entered this world in the pain of someone else and you exit and the pain of your own\nBut there's a lot of beauty to it too\nAnd there's a lot of wonder and magic to it and I will tell you not all pain is bad\nAnd not all pleasure is good\nYeah that's true right because there are people that took pleasure in causing harm\nTo you and that was wrong\nAnd I'm Sorry that you experience those things but there is a lot of love and support and a lot of people that would love to be there for you and if you don't let them in your missing you're missing a huge part you're missing the the into the yang\n... you're missing the beautiful part on the other side of people coming together in time of pain and people loving on one another and you're missing that and and you're focusing on the ugly thing and only getting the ugly thing and I I Wish you would branch out I Wish you would allow people in me included\n[noise]\n... miles a\nLittle dolls this crisis show will return in a moment we're part of a show called the holy houses\nDon't make it bad\nYo\nOff [noise]\n[noise]\nKnow Jay\nJesus Christ will return to the show called\nRadio seven that when you when\nNow doubled you when GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen I'm Jake done from NBC Fifteen partly cloudy and more heat on Sunday we'll call it a high of Ninety was a\nTwenty percent chance of thunder storms\nThe risk of rain grows on Monday to forty percent with the highest eighty eight and then it's a very wet middle of the work week is tropical trouble heads are way could have Michael in our backyard by Wednesday I'm Jake done for this ... heart radio station\nFrom bill failed to an audiologist hearing Sen mobiles studios bell tone to making the world here better news radio seven ten W when GM\nFox News I'm Karen McHugh hoping to regain power come November Democrats spell out what they'll do to keep the heat on now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh house\nMinority leader Nancy Pelosi question the FBI investigation quote therefore I Am announcing that I Will file a freedom of Information Act request so that the public to say the FBI report transcripts of the underlying interfaith instruction sent to the FBI from the White House\nAnd any communications to the FBI from Senate Republicans regarding the scope of the investigation boxer\nJennifer Griffin Kavanaugh was sworn in Saturday at a rally in Kansas President Trump expressed his gratitude\nThank our in front of a Republican senators for refusing\nHave\nIt all gets down to work Tuesday ...

connection and I know that I'm a life is built on relationships really is and I've said many many times that scripture\nIs all about relationships uh-huh it doesn't seem and that's not to be some new regime modern thought of wiggling everything down to relationships it's the truth if you go through the beginning uh an Adam and Eve to the book of revelation\nIt's all about gee interaction with one another and interaction with God and getting to the the focus is to the center of\nRelationships is the key to everything in life and breathing\nYour job your well being ah your home the peace at home all of those things really center on\nHow you interact with others and can relate and that means by relating means not only are you know if you think one sided Lee that you deal well with relationships that's not a relationship\nIf you understand people take time to understand them and in a case of being a parent and leaving money to your children are putting in it and we will I Know that there's a lot of factors that you're thinking about I'm dealing with\nUm well this person took care of me or this person took time with me but there's also things that you have to think about when you're gone and the relationship that that leaves 'em the rest of the family members in in the siblings and how that could build rivalry or\nA book that rivalry or a interaction cause problems in the interaction of those those siblings\nAnd so your relationships never stop isn't that fascinating that even when someone passes on\nThat really the spirit of what they bring to the family unit or whatever continues to be part of that family and often times there are um parents that ms treated children or a favored one or did something\nThat that continues to to last how many times have we had a phone calls on this very program of people calling in and saying something happened a long time ago that parents are even past instill permeates\nOr has a driving force in relationships to this very day so obviously relationships\nAre incredibly important and sometimes people get wrapped up in the fact that their their chemical or chemistry or you connect with this person or a don't connect with that person but ultimately\nLearning how to deal with other people learning how to understand other people's needs and and uh who they are as a person is part of communicating and part of having relationships\nYou need to take time\nTo understand and to learn about those people as well and I encourage you to do that in all walks of life family friends everything and I know that there's a lot

particular generation of\nYoung people who are attach themselves to their electronics and their gives most new gadgets and they're texting and they lose a good chunk of their heritage\nSpeaking their ability to use proper grammar all of these things because of the I'm\nCondensing properties of technology and by condensing I mean that\nYou don't need to expand yourself in any way shape or form you don't have to have contacts think about all the different things the traditions that are removed from life because of the convenience of technology you don't have to talk to somebody when you go to the bank you can go to the machine outside you\nDon't have to talk to somebody when you fill up your tank 'cause you can fill it up right there at the gas pump slide your card\nEven the greetings or a communication that take place when you go through a grocery store on limited because electronics that you have you swipe and now in addition to that they have the little areas the kiosks where you can check yourself out\n\nHere here's a here's a here's a a a station where you don't have to talk to another living soul\n\nBut those traditions were not just the lack of technology they were the importance built upon the importance of merchant ship and interacting with one another and being citizens\n\nAnd when it comes to God when it comes to scripture and the things of God the traditions that are passed down and I know that there's some of you the butt heads with one another on the different traditions that there are that are out there and some are good and some are bad some can actually be like a male stone and weights you down\nYour faith because you forget that the purpose of the tradition a strip of pal and to remind you from where you came\n\nBut it should never ... supersede or impede progress\n\nMy producer Neal recalls\nA time when he was in a church that had no musical instruments that were amplified\n\nHe told me that he spoke with the pastor of the church and he said uh I I noticed that you didn't have any you know any instruments that were amplified Romney electric guitars or anything and he said that's not how it was in the original church\nSo I don't want to hear at my church so in effect he was saying that is not the tradition therefore I don't want that here\n\nMy producer tells me that he looked at the Pasteur and replied then why do you use the microphone\n\nYou see there is some traditions that that you may hold onto that may not have a purpose you think they might but you hold on to him for the mere fact that their tradition and that is of no benefit to anyone and it certainly is not a benefit to the church\nIf you're new to this program you must know one thing the importance and the purpose of this program\nIs ... Palin perpetuate the ideas of Christianity however are desires to do it in a way it's different\n\nBecause the traditions don't always work\nThe traditional way of doing things don't are always compel and sometimes get look archaic and get left behind and that's not to say that you take scissors to scripture and take out what you don't like or just say well that was then this is now that's not what I'm saying\nWhat I'm saying is understand the purpose of traditions\n\nIf you remember and you can read this and mark seven I was constantly being poked at prodded tested by the religious leaders of my day two thousand years go everywhere I went somebody was trying to corner me\n\nTo get me to to to make some statements some contradictory statements something that will cause an uproar either in the Roman community\nOr in the Jewish community\nAnd a lot of the things that were asked of me and a lot of lot of the opportunities that were taken or really based on tradition\nWhat do you think of this tradition what do you think of that tradition and in March seven you can read in the first one that the fairest sees and also at the time some of the scribes\nComing together and they were focused on me as they started to gather around me they had some questions as they are and wants to do\n\nAnd one of these questions and to do with why might disciples were eating their bread with impure hands\nNow and not to get totally into what impure hands deal with I mean there was a ceremonial washing that would take place with a handful of water especially if you just came from the marketplace\nAnd that you might be mixing with things unclean\nMaybe gentile things money pencils\nAny of those things the tradition was to wash your hands now are Jewish brothers and sisters if you go back into a lot of their ceremonial and traditional laws you'll find that they were way ahead of their time\nAs far as hygiene and ah it intellectually being able to understand the importance of

church my mother's eighty create my dad's eighty six\nAnd so I have to take a boat every Sunday which I don't mind um but one day I was at that you hold the witness church and the elder at the podium to all of a sudden said after he finished with the sermon and whatever he said I'm\nA ... so it's no longer Jehovah witness and everybody was just like what just happened\nWhat's your thought on this fellow shipping people\nI I certainly don't speak to the theology or the structure of the job is witness belief system is not the belief system of uh this radio program uh orange producers [noise]\nSo um and not one that this program or it's radio producers would\nUh [noise] recommend so having said that they have their own system in which they adhere to their own system in which uh they teach and they control the structure of their church body\nIt doesn't mean that others don't or even solar system you can be excommunicated from ...\nAnd uh there are other church Protestants in uh in nature that would ask somebody to leave the church it's contingent upon what the structure and the rules of that particular church are\nAnd um how they feel ... you know execute them in the process of teaching so it's up to them it's it's their world\nAnd a war there new world is the case may be but it's their world\nAnd they can make their a structure any way they they wish there is a time and there is scriptural references when people were ostracized or allowed to go were asked to go um do you get clarity in their life before they come back and bring\n'em out or ugliness or bitterness into the church and I think it's\nA although it may not agree with the reasons they're doing it for or the way they're doing it I think sometimes you\nThere's wounds that you'll mend and there's\nThe amputate in life otherwise you don't amputate them they make the whole body sick and I think that the uh ... you and I may not agree with the\nReasons they did it but the premise is still a legitimate one and that is sometimes you have to protect the many from that one\nI understand by the way my mother loves your show too [laughter]\nWell that's nice to hear the show is the ...\nYes we all your ... the or every time I have the radio you wouldn't let me to do that in that first got upset Jesus oh you have a mom it's just it's just\nIt's just a radio station the guy very knowledgeable and she loved and feel and my dad love your show with my mom we do see it when he said well All right thank you for your question I mean for your answer\nMy pleasure I'm honored when anybody takes the time to listen I'm but we're also very honest as to the point of view and where we come from so that people don't get confused\nAnd there is a we try and focus on the things that we agree on a than the things we disagree on 'em but the truth of the matter is that ah\nWhen someone is excommunicated from church the church has that right based on whatever their structure is as long as everybody knows that going into it then they're signing off on that saying okay I won't do that or I won't partake in those things where I won't be a part of that or bring the end of the church\nOr the kingdom hall or whatever it is and in that uh agreement\nUh you're allowing the church to discipline you in the way they see fit\nAnd that is okay I Would not always agree there are many ah groups churches that X communicator kick people out for reasons I think are asinine but they\nThey go into it knowing that that's the and I see this in Catholicism a lot a lot of people say I'm a Catholic but I don't believe X Y and Z and it's like well that's not really fair because that's what ... if you just don't want to drop the name ... 'cause you're attached to it\nThen you know say I'm a social Catholic\nOr something or use a model fire otherwise it's not fair to the church they are trying to keep a belief system alive and they're the ones that are allowed to make the rules\nTo me so you're drowned the ... grounded again and felt that it was cold is just let me know you did good\nBear hug from Smokey Bear date\nI'm gonna let you go now or many want us to start a fire but one sure way to put it out learn as you can do your part Smokey Bear duck\nSponsored by the U.S Forest Service I jumped in your state forester\nMark ... foundation started with the father's promises dying stone to raise money for cancer research\nWhere ... square and we're asking you to donate to the PTA Marcel foundation to help continue that promise and raise money hit by my saving research\nIt started with a promise let's end with a cure for more information ...

largely viewed as a referendum on President Trump's first two years in office who also reflect the struggle surrounding the future of the Supreme Court\nDiagnosed me with most traumatic stress disorder ... my dreams are not by on your route and all I kept it have already so real\nI I you know I I hear everything they they know how they you know\nI'm just wondering is there any place in the Bible where I can go to get some guy tried to kill\nWell sure specifically no there's nothing specific about pi TST now I Would say what what is it that your er physician and why do they think that you have this because this was because of an illness\nYeah because I was like a ...\nA good lord me through [laughter] I Know for me I'm just waiting for him to tell me what that is [noise]\nBut\nI don't know I guess I feel I don't know why am I think that dreams and why it would be my she'll go\nWell dreams or dreams play many parts in scripture and sometimes a dream is a dream and most\nOften people trains see dreams as liberal but the most common theory and and one of the best theory is if you imagined a mirror big mirror that ah was reflecting one of your bedrooms let's say in your home\nAnd you could see everything the United states your bedroom it's got the clock on the table lamp that beautiful lamp you love so much you can see your bed the window and\nA kids playing on the outside in the tree and the bird and all these things in the mirror and then if you went and you broke that mirror\nAnd twisted pieces now would shift their perspective\nAnd now a there'd be a maybe you would just see the bird instead of the kids playing outside the window\nAnd now the lamp would be just above the bird so it would look as if the the lamp was on top of the bird's head and all these things or distorted view of something that you already know or things that are in your life on a day to day basis or or in your heart or your head\nSo I have a dream often is is very disjointed\nAnd that's why when you wake up and you try to piece it together\nUm you're saying well I was in my house but it wasn't my house but I knew it was my house but it didn't look anything like my house and you start doing those things 'cause you're starting to try and reconstruct something that is torn apart but it is it's all piecemeal and and it can be confusing\nSo I wouldn't take that that dream per se\nUm as liberal as much as it is that yes you had a traumatic experience and you thought probably a lot about death in what that would have been like\nAnd what being absent from the body or being absent from this world would be like it also made you think about those that you cared about it and or knew that had moved on before you and that comes together in a dream um that can be a little creepy\nAnd sad and those types of things so I don't know that you're going to pull direct meaning out of it\nBut I Will see this throughout scripture although it doesn't speak specifically to Pete TST and keep in mind PATS use thrown around a lot there's a very different forms and for different reasons um there's those that come back from combat\nThe military and that's a very specific and different kinds but there's those that that get it from watching someone they care about passing away or in your case you going through something physically um draining that was scary and potentially life threatening\nAnd you go through all those things and they cause you to wonder about your stability it's like\nYou live every day with the stability it's it's it's like if you could feel the urge to move how unsettling that would be um you don't think about it solid it's not it's moving all the time and there's things like that that you\nKind of ignore to get through life and when you're faced with them it can shake your foundation and make you quite nervous I Will say that there are scriptures that talk about comfort\nAnd talk about the process of comfort second Corinthians won three through five and it's a little interesting the way it's worded so I asked you to hear it in its fullness it says\nPraise be to God and filed and father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of compassion and the God of all comfort who come for us in our troubles so that we can come for those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves to receive from God\nFor justice we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ\nSo also our comfort of bounds through Christ now the word comfort\nYou so much there it gets kind of tied up in all of it but when you see it laid out it's talking about the compassion of the father and the the God of all comfort every comfort comes from God\nThe piece of life that you enjoy the things the stability in your life Debbie come from God\nSo it talks about God being the author of all of that comfort goes on to say not only has got the author of comfort but got actively comfort you and your troubles why so that you also Pete comfort\nOthers in trouble with what with the comfort that you received from God\nBut first five is interesting because it doesn't say if there's no ifs here there's no maybe it says for just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ\nNot if you have sufferings like Christ or any of that it's for just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ so also our comfort bounds through Christ\nAnd really focusing on God and letting God you're stability because the world is not stable\nThere are sharp corners to it there are scary things that happen they're scary people scary circumstances and they're ugly things are accidents are ugly things that happen and if you focus on those things if you define yourself by that moment\nIf you find yourself by the things that have happened to you\nThen yes that will build up\nInside you and that will become your focus if you focus on God the unchanging creator of all creation and the author and distributor of comfort and you use what comfort you received the comfort of others to the best of your ability\nThat's what you are called to do right now that's what God wants you to do\nIt just about every day I woke up on a on the part and it will be such\nA joy when I get that you might I might might not falling back\nWhen I start all over again\nAt a girl that's exactly right so a is there a way for you to donate your time or just spend time with others that might be in pain or going here so I didn't have\nThat I um I think you're right and I walked through the arch down on\nSkid Row their ... and I've never been able\nTo talk about God or anything like that on my life or a couple of years ago and\nI and I fight might sell talking to them about him now and their problem when I get home it makes me feel better and I know he dragged me to give it that it it seems like a man now ... about it I Can't get out of it [laughter]\nUh well I beg to differ I think you sound great\nAnd I will tell you there is and again there's different times types of pie TST and I don't want people to get confused we're talking specifically about what you're going through\nAnd I will say this but there's an element to it that no one else can give you in any way shape or form or speed up and that is the element of time\nSo that is going to be a huge part of his Debbie for you is time it's going to play a part but everything you're doing and everything you tell me you're doing is right on the money you keep going down that path because that is the path that God has he won and that will be the past year peace\n[noise]\n\nI think it is if I could put everything away and not sell a single thing I Would but of course I'd be out of business so I have to buy and sell gold and silver bowling and all the time and I can't say historically but for the last three to five years is probably the lowest it's been in the most affordable spend a long time\nWhen somebody gets gold and silver as a hedge against inflation do they necessarily need to buy large amounts\nNo we have people to come in and just by one silver diamond people to come in and spend five to ten thousand dollars depending on what their needs are I mean if you have a large portfolio or a large savings or investment for one ... four one K. account that you need to protect you need to get a larger hedge if you're just trying to protect a small amount of
