Fox News President Trump leveling that charge against Democrats at a political rally in Kentucky\nHere's the rough part when it comes to abortion um\nIt's important it is a a a vulgar display in many ways\nAnd to get into the details what's taking place a would make most people lose their breakfast however I assure you that the ... the everybody has made it a political issue which is to me almost equally as vulgar\nBecause what gets lost on both sides\nIs the fact that there is no one in less there's some bizarre twist you didn't individual there is no one on either side that wants to see a baby died no one the confusion comes\nBecause there are ... what really sets the two sides apart it's the definition of when it's a baby\nSo the but no one setting out to kill babies and I it's the that's an ugly thought to think that that's what people are really doing they're not I mean it's just the definition when it's a baby so science says something different than theology [noise]\nYet as a scientist you or they're representing the laws of the land and medicine to take care of your patients\nWell the ... currently says that under certain circumstances um during certain times of the pregnancy that to abort\nPregnancy is OK mhm if you're in a public facility\nYour job is to uh give them the information they need to make the best decisions they can't put the decision is not on us on the individual just like in anything your job is to give them the best information but the patient and say no I don't want to take the pill or no I don't want to follow up they can even tell you\nThat they don't want you to resuscitate them right correct\nAnd you could say that that's against God's will because now you are allowing them to make a decision to to not live\nCrack\nSo there's a lot of weight on you as a physician and uh in the nursing community as well that those that are in the medical\nProfession to give the best information and that's what you're called to do it's not a point of preaching\nNow if you feel that there's an opportunity and you want to make sure that they have the best information on both sides that's fine but as far as allowing somebody in the United states to make that decision there are laws to protect them to be able to do so and if you're going to be a physician in a public\nOr in the public arena uh-huh they are going to be allowed to do that\nFor [laughter] how they had a co authored by not clear yet Chris from all around me we treat people ate or not on\nMy farm and lever and so what would you say that\nWell if they don't if they don't feel comfortable with doing that there might be a way of realm that for you to allow someone else to uh-huh forced or things of that nature or wherever there's a a point where if you're going to be in that industry\nAnd it is in the United states and it is legal\nThen there's going to be issues and\nShe can even or he can even make a claim and say hey it as a person of faith this upsets me and I don't want to be a part of it and it's fair to a certain degree but there's a point where\nIf the laws are with the laws are and if you don't want to participate in that then you know if you had a job was witnessing there didn't believe in blood transfusions uh-huh now that becomes an issue and ... and that starts to infringe on the individual's right\nWho has a legal right to get a blood transfusion there going well I don't want to fill up the paperwork or I don't want to do this and that becomes a little sticky so if there are ways around it that can be done ... and just does not impede on the legal rights and individual rights of the person wanting whatever treatment that is legal\nUm than you can adapt to those but you can't just hope the system based on your face because in that process um you're taking away the rights of an individual um that is legal in the United states and that that becomes a problem as well um to those that want to choose that so my\nComment kids like fair play that I put a lever\nRight that's right I Would not have up on that question like that good but\nHere I Am I on Saturday eater\nI'm not sure that I worked when I was the end up with you I end up not ... right yeah and\nIf I wait are betraying who hooked up with everything abortion I referred to a colleague of mine down because people have the right to\nGreat Fisher quieter I right or wrong and I am I right on that if I Am I able to\nComply with that\nGroup I talked to someone out so far away and that that was my comfort to light on any good at it you\nKnow I think that's a very honest way of approaching it because if you start becoming the the Christian police it becomes problematic now let's say you're a checker at a grocery store\nAnd now you're you're looking at\nTwinkies and ... and the person in front of you is overweight\nAnd you start going well I'm not going to sell this to you because you're obviously abusing it or any of those you start policing everybody's option and if the freedoms exist in the United states you have to allow that now you don't have to do it yourself in that sense but your your practice has to have somebody\nThat is able to write that referral or to do that otherwise it stopped being a practice\nAnd a a medical practice and starts being a religious practice um which becomes a problem and I think that your your your console was very fair and honest and looking at making sure everybody's taking care of and I think that was the right way to go about it thank you\nYou're welcome and thank you for what you do it's a it's a\nVery important thing that you do in and I I Know that your face ties into it and you're praying for people and you're being there and that makes you a even more important out there is a position to have the balance between your scientific mind and your spiritual sense as well I think is a very important a part\nOf the medical industry this is incredibly difficult subject but I really want people to here and we beat the left with the thought that nobody wants to kill babies\nNobody does I Know that's the easier way to think about it and to look at it it's not about that it's the definition of when they see a baby\nAnd it may be different than yours and that's part of the fight part of the fight is to to get science to see that and and um as they see that then that will change but as if the majority of doctors see that as tissue and not yet a baby then it won't matter what you do indoor say\nThat's where it will change but nobody's going around smiling at taking the life of a child nobody wants that no one no matter how hard core they are on either side it's a matter of the definition of when it's child [noise]\n[noise]\n... return\n\nMessaging ... burning your degree from one

to be completed at the same time or you say in one day you have a bunch of tasks and they all need to be done\nLike that I think that they ... on kickoff nature internal ... are ... who I could I ask ...\nWhere do you think the time it's going if if if time seems to be going out the window where do you think it goes\nWell you know I'm not sure how much they have like a lot working after ... or ... or ... or ... actually worked on that well you know ... how can I ask you know if it's ...\nWell that's a that's a legitimate question which is why I asked about where you think your time is going if there's there is such thing as too much work I Know that there are buses that would say differently or companies that would go no you cannot there you can always do more work\nAnd I'm not a huge fan of that there's a a time in a place on a ... is to where you would break where you just have\nOnly enough to give there were times where I walked away and rested there are times where a a I Would leave a city and people would say well aren't you going to do X Y and Z and I'd say no I'm\nI'm done here in a moving on somewhere else otherwise there's always something around the corner if you think it's a legitimate amount of work and you should be able to do it\nThen you need to find a trio system of sorts to tackle certain things I Would I Would gather that out of every task or group of tests that you have there is one test that seems to be more daunting than the rest or um maybe you know less about it\nAnd usually when your when you don't feel confident we're strong about a particular task is when it slows you down because you don't want to do it wrong you don't want to do it incorrectly and so you were you kind of put it off or\nGo at it very slowly so you could see if there is in in any group of tasks there's one in particular that seems to weigh you down or the ... that you or intimidated by\nAnd put that at the top of the list to finish a take care of that ask questions do what you need to do but\nAlways creating the ... the type of work what what's going to be simple to do what's going to take time or what you need to learn to do before you can complete it never never be afraid of asking questions if you're in a place where they they don't like asking questions well it's not a great place I\nCouldn't confident or I Will always go either ... or ... ...

the workplace is changing and they're expecting more of people and they're not really necessarily caring about the family unit the same way\nThey figure they will always find somebody who will give up whatever to do the task and it's unfortunate I Will tell you this that if it's if there's not one particular test that his daunting there's not one particular test that you feel you don't understand\nAnd that way you down then you started the simplest first and you cross things off your list there's nothing more refreshing\nThan feeling like you've got you had success on some things

Fox News\nThat pledge from White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow which President Trump promises to find out what happened to journalist ... the Washington Post contributor disappeared earlier this month after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nThings happen but this other southern classification is other type of trial that comes your way is a spiritual trial these are attacks that\nStrangely enough are often brought on by you when you invite the enemy into your life it's like inviting the the devil for dinner for whatever it is in your life that you're doing there are times where you do things where you welcome the enemy in\n\nAny Christian any Christian family can take on attacks from the enemy\nBut as a believer you must remember that the the knob of your spiritual door\nIs on the inside and it's only open by you the devil can't truly getting your life unless you open the door and give him opportunity\nThis opportunity comes from you rejecting things have God straying from the things have gone looking for that opportunity that you know is not godly looking for that relationship that you know was not godly rejecting things that you know our godly\n\nYou've opportunities in your life come your way and you think well just because they came your way they must be of God not always there are relationships that are not good for you\n\nThere's jobs that you shouldn't be it or maybe there's another one that is coming your way that would be a better for you there are things that you do to manipulate at times so\nBad\nThat you welcome the enemy and\nYou get to that place where it doesn't matter what the consequences are you just want what you want\nYou're giving the devil an opportunity when you ignore the warning signs the red flags in your life how many times on this very program have or we open the phone lines in and talk to people that I've called up and they have warning signs in relationships or situations and they ignore them\nWhen you go through something like this when you ignore\nThose\nRed flags those warning signs the alarms that are going off in your life\nYour giving the enemy and opportunity\nSeasons for twenty seven says and do not give the devil an opportunity\nPointing out that you play a part and as you play a part in the dance in the interaction with the enemy the devil himself to play a part in your life\nNow you may make excuses for it you may look for a reason and say well I was doing this because well I was lonely and I wanted someone my life but when doing that when the loneliness\nOr your situation supersedes ... you know to be right or good or the will of God then you open up that door and say come on in devil and you invite the devil dinner\nBecause that seems like a better plan than waiting on God\nThe enemy profiles around you looking for this opening even masquerading to look more pleasant to you trying to fool you to look like an opportunity for a relationship to look like a job opportunity to look like an opportunity to get something easier\nLess stress making something more obtainable to satisfy that that quick fix\nFirst Peter five eight says be of sober spirit beyond the alert your adversary the devil profiles around like a roaring line seeking someone to devour\nDon't let that someone but you don't give any enemy the opportunity to consume you\nSecond Corinthians ... fourteen says no wonder for even Satan disguise themself as an angel of light if you get caught up\nIn that that appearance way things appear to you and it looks like hey here's that opportunity I Want it not always is that the right way to go\n... says to test all things hold fast to that which is true if you're constantly running after whatever opportunity comes your way\nYou'll set yourself up if you allow people in your life that you know aren't good for you you set yourself up you open yourself up if you disregard the things of God\nYou treat people poorly you don't follow the rules in life changing them always to sue your needs\nYou open it up for the enemy\nYou surround yourself self with the things in life that are of vulgar or contrary to God or ugly\nYou open up the opportunity and each of these opportunities\nAre an opening a crack a possibility for the enemy to enter officials for twenty seven again and do not give the devil and opportunity\nAny crack any Fisher\nLittle opening in your life is an opportunity for the enemy\n\nIt's not the devil is behind every bad thing that happens to you as I said you live in this life you are human being you go through things that human beings go through sometimes that's sickness sometimes it's a flat tire sometimes it's a a a leak that is wrong and your bathroom\nAll of these things I understand may seem like trials but they aren't necessarily of the devil\nThere of the world\nThe world is a place with many many sharp edges\nBut the special type of trial this this spiritual trial from the enemy\nOften

the Jesus Christ show [noise] I think the Graham yes how can I help you good morning to you hello\nHi I'm yes I Am I was calling because I was concerned I was considering a you know this is a holiday it only got Halloween we got ... and then there's all the various holiday in the world [noise]\nAnd um you know if that can you think thing because people do different things and uh and I I'm Betty how are we waiting\nAnd um I was ... by their thing about Christmas that really brought a light to me that that is tempered twenty if it's not a that it isn't there and then I think about it and think about it and I did research and things and um\nYou know like for example a lot of these cards are greeting card a stale place like Mother's Day Father's Day grandparents a secretary a an added in them\nAnd that you know in in scripture re I kind of\nRoman a Fifteen five I'm On work till the end of the subject but really the heart that\nWe don't live for ...\nWell we have driven to the lord we would every day we answer to God and that we do it and get thanks and shouldn't be checking our our brother that that we should get not do the things that are are blatantly um\nSo are you worried about celebrating holidays\nBecause I I I'm not so much worried about it I ... in a ... totally embrace\nEach day is a blessing and and and do the best you can with it and it's you know 'cause everybody knew how old they were you know in the Bible\nI won't tell you this there's nothing wrong with holidays are they the holy days of the past no hum are a lot of them a ... at ... at bare minimum embellished by the greeting card companies absolutely but that doesn't mean that you can't celebrate a mother or someone's burst or any of\nThese things I think that uh there are some groups and some may consider them fringe groups or that or take this to a degree where they don't celebrate anything and it's a it's to me that is more militant\nOn Christian\nIn the the attitude of celebrating all things I mean first ... uh five sixteen and Eighteen rejoice always pray without ceasing give thanks and all circumstance where this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you there's\nThere's ... do you need a special day no but then you could say the same about the Sabbath you don't need a special day for that either it's just a matter of taking\nThe time and and rejoicing and celebrating people and sometimes it's easier to put something on the calendar or than it is because people putting it off all the time\nYou do it with relationships of any kind you do it with friendships with getting together for coffee or tea or lunch or dinner or whatever it might be you put them off constantly\nAnd sometimes it's easier just to get something on the calendar and say this is the day that we're going to celebrate mothers or fathers or family or friends or whatever it might be\nAnd some of them may feel silly and you don't have to celebrate them and yes you can go back to the origins of Christmas and Easter and you can look that they weren't celebrated by the early church and of course I wasn't born in December\nUm it wouldn't make sense biblical e based on what was taking place during the time on my birth all those things absolutely true however there's nothing wrong with taking a time\nPutting it on the calendar and the case of things like Christmas and Easter there were pagan holidays during that time or the early church wanted to try and root those big on holidays out so they kind of plopped\nMy birth and my resurrection into those slots to try and squelch or squash\nThe pagan a religious ceremonies or uh festivals for things like that and that was the way of the early church trying to\nKind of get their way I get all that but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't even matter there's pagan uh ties in\n... when it comes to Christmas and it comes to Easter the the bunny rabbits the eggs all that stuff comes from pagan roots of the Christmas tree itself I'm is tied to pagan roots but it doesn't matter because that's not what people are celebrating\nAnd so to take a time of celebration to enjoy any more than people are celebrating you know pay guns\nOn Halloween they're just not no kid is looking at the theological significance of Halloween is thinking I get to dress up which kids love to do and run around and get

down to earth mhm they land in the ... of our best Marion because their Bible exact like I've been studying history and\nOur Ten Commandments can be found ... law and an obvious cloth book or Scott one twenty six digits Bible paraphrase is our commandments\nAnd it's not the ... and it's not the only the similarities there are great similarities wrote other civilizations as well\nLike Greece and ... and ... them and the way that they preach and and then the exact same cycle what'd she just couldn't put a little Louis transcendence in what form\nUm the the ... and the resurrection final day today and then\nThe but there but there's also there's also pre cycles that are much different than Christianity by far so ... and be careful not to confine them and just because there are similarities last uh last week um we talked about counter fits and there gets to be a point where\nSimilarities don't mean the same uh their counterfeit dollar bills that are very similar but I wouldn't try and pass them\nOkay but what I was saying is when it got cut up the ankles if they landed in Atlanta or five hundred years ago and what happened to go and then your church and culture at the exact same thing that's very bad and all that energy just came back to\nCountries that you know that that was the wrong way of worship the right way to set the record straight that would\nUm if you're taking out all the ... the timelines in which they were created and not all the similarities in one marker all the different isn't it different or ... you can see how religion\nIt it's like racial distorted\nAnd it hurt we've fallen angel Jesus came back the record straight because we were actually a couple of basic actually took our Bible because\nThere are theories are based on similar notions the problem is that uh the timeline is based on the timeline is when it becomes difficult when you're dealing with falling angels\nAnd the concept of fallen angels are you talking about revelation twelve step in through nine talking about the battle with Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon or Satan\nThere's no specific time as a matter of fact when something's happening in heaven and that concept it's really outside of time so if you're using that as a\nBasis to say okay we'll started here and\nThere are similarities no doubt similarities may point to a\nStandards through point where you have\nA belief systems starting here moving through here some parts are taken some parts are removed some some of its polluted some of it's added to what have you I get that and that has most certainly taken place but to try and track trace it back entirely to\nThe fallen angels might be a little difficult from a historical or timeline perspective\nBut absolutely no doubt\nThat with the falling of the angels needles coming to earth as it says\nIn scripture says in that very scripture revelation twelve seven through nine talks about or that he was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him\nThat in that process that there there wasn't counterfeit and destruction and things that went along with it so I get the big picture of where you're going and how you look at it looks like here you had a face\nAnd then how you have those those that would be motivated to destroy that face\nCausing pollution and counter fits in all these things that would twist it around and that you say that you can kind of traced that back but I think there's you're dealing with other things that are outside the timeline of history and then within the timeline of history and that poses kind of a problem to figure out is to\nWhat took place when and where man stands in in the whole equation as well\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nYour

um [noise] reading a lot of maybe I don't know a George ... special people talking but I've heard a lot that once you pass away we go into\nA spiritual where I'm more recalled for a learning process period of time\nI heard some say that it's up to this whole spirit\nWe want to come back to everybody and go to this whole again or we can just stay up and have it and it says that most people prefer

remember oh your [noise]\nYour view on both of those\nOkay first of all there's room for ten more people and haven't I'm just kidding that would be horrible you know there's plenty of room\nI haven't does not have the walls and the uh restrictions of time and space the way you think of them here and there is no limitation God didn't make it in in say oh my gosh I invited all these people I didn't think they were all going to make it\nIt's not a situation like that so no worries there there is there's no limit to where somebody will be left out that believes that\nIsn't I mean there there are all these people are shaped by chosen perish just a going around and have and I know the soldiers parents like many school as far as a white is Russia whatever but [noise] it\nIt does not does not take up space you're applying a human restrictions and attributes of this world to the next in there is none at the time there is no time continuum there's no special concerns is not the same way in the same sense at all you\nHave one of six hundred billion people it wouldn't matter right now and a Christ God would still be control over all of that you wouldn't matter whatever's going on on our\nOr it doesn't it doesn't matter because there is no uh limitations there now as far as the second question and answer\n... ... ... ... per se they tried to have a very brief pre ... third question about the feeling practices evangelist and very very high may I ask you have to answer the question [noise]\nSure sure or ...\nOr ... being reborn not being able to remember going through\nSomething back ... ...\nThat's not Christianity that day you it you'd quoted some versus earlier in Corinthians and ah in Hebrew loosely paraphrase them about a ... in Corinthians about a is there to be up she from the buddies to be present with lord\nBut it also says in Hebrew state your um it's appointed for men to die once and then the judgment\nSo there is no there's no place for what is referred to as to some sorrow that cycle of life there is no place for reincarnation reincarnation was never in scripture a there is no place for it it doesn't fit\nAnd uh and and so that doesn't make sense with Christianity or\nEven in the church and I know so little not out there but he does have an urge to Cape ... stuff beyond so it's basically just tore done that had\nGeorge ... a lovely man a very smart man and he does have very interesting I guess on coast to coast\nI Am a but but his his job and his focus is not the same as the ... the show\nSo so ... he's looking at things from a broader spectrum then this this program as we're very focused on the Christian Judeo Christian priest opposition and the Christian theology and specific\nSo uh we obviously have a different point in and when it comes to that so in this particular case\nThere is nothing in scripture that allows for that reincarnation and there's no need for it now there be those that argue are Catholic brothers and sisters argue that there is a purgatory but there are different but\nThere's different beliefs in that that has changed throughout the years as well as to what that means what's taking place\nUm but as far as mainstream Christianity or Protestantism um they differ so mainstream Christianity deeply Catholicism in ... in that same basket they're going to get run to defer I'm Still keep in mind there's differences are very quickly so we can make sure that we are shared everyone else\nYou had one more question you want to do a ask\nJust quick a venture capital call and probably the most part we know are there are a little quaint evangelists ... yelling powers I went to Catholic Church going up on\n[laughter] I never even touched me all my friends [laughter] you know what I mean I [laughter] I Know this is why when actually\nIt's just I mean it's like why does that manifest an entirely true not only [laughter] present only under what they call here I\nDon't get that I I mean I think\nMike it depends because and this is nuts or specifically speaking about anyone who refers to himself as a faith healer [noise] a lot of that is garbage a lot of it ties in to theatrics and whatnot and psychology that takes place during\nA a group experience like that that doesn't mean that it can't take place of course\nThere are gifts to the spirit that do take place and they were stealing that could take place to this day but that is God's will not the will of an individual or um their ability or we'll speak through somebody like a profit and got ... ... somebody like a healer\nBut it's not done in the theatrical way the way it often is portrayed in Christianity across the board there are many of those that um you know act as if they are face healers and really it's amount of the tricks and people get caught up\nIn something the same way you can watch a movie that you know was absolutely fake that that is factors that you've seen many times before you could start to cry or get angry or a beef thrilled by the outcome\nBecause emotionally you're having experienced with those uh other people in the cedar while watching something so you have to be careful as to what your experience is your experience should always be lining up with scripture and things of God and it should never be to the glory of an individual other than God\nI'm you shouldn't have to pay for such a thing these types of things\nI should be thought of a before you you go and experience and things because they can be a quite emotional\nAnd um yeah I mean you know you catch you up in that kind of overall attitude and and excitement and you can think that it's spiritual when it's just psychological something to think about um brother and not be lost in that\n[noise]

Jesus show Jesus show\nKen welcome to Jesus Christ show\nEither oh when I was eight years old I'm I was a Christian camp I'm forming LA I watch the boy drowned right in front of me oh um it was a horrible traumatic event that changed my life forever\nAnd\nNow like ticket to being an adult I'm\nForty years old now and I decided to have my daughter baptized about two weeks ago and I got the director of the lake and my daughter's very excited and I'm very excited however baptized I drive in the same way that I watch the boy drowned when I was exactly her age\nAnd\nI kind of ... the whole and then again and I was devastated I mean the odds of this happening of all the places that\nUm I could have had my daughter baptized that was a ... like the same place so I watch this happen and you know I didn't know why this was going on out and mixed feelings about it maybe I shouldn't do it or maybe it's cursed um is this really what God's Plan is is\n... or if they use this white guy and you know I decided that you know this wasn't about me anymore for the call my daughter accepting Jesus Christ in our life and our ... or what happened and we decided to do it I I was wondering if there's any in Africa at all\nWell I'll tell you ... ... ... ... a first I'm very proud of you because you push through it the enemy had you at every turn on that one he would have loved nothing more than you to turn that car around and not have your daughter baptized\nIt would've been a huge victory in his eyes and you push through it\nThere were a lot of things that are going to take place that you drive on roads every day that people have lost loved ones on\nEvery day\nYou've done to hospitals where people have died you've gone to restaurants where people have been a it's gotten\nSick or might have choked on something death is a part of life it's everywhere but you need to see the significance of the instance and what's taking place rather than the fact that there's a history of something now if that child died because there was something in that water\nI wouldn't blame you\nBut because of a freak accident or someone dying\nOr to not use you know there's a reason that it's the same place this particular church were churches in general in that area may use this for you said it was a Christian camp or a a and now it's a Christian baptism\nThat there is you know it's a body of water in the area it's it's normal for it to be used in different purposes but what I Want you to take from this is the fact\nThat things aren't evil unto themselves\nThere isn't an evil thing in the world evil is when morally neutral things or have bad relationships\nSo for instance when a child is in a unattended or doesn't swim well water can be evil in the relationship between that person and the water and they can drown\nBut in a baptism that's controlled\nUh there are people around to watch and it's done structurally um it can be a beautiful thing about the awakening of someone's spirit and the acknowledgement of their face\nSo likewise if someone broke into your house heaven forbid with a gun that's a bad thing but if right behind them law enforcement broke into your house with a gun that's a good thing\nAnd so I Want you to stop you know not to see this lake is something good or bad it was depending on how was experienced that was good or bad but the lake itself is not evil and it isn't cursed\nUh-huh or anything like that situation link it's very sad that you had to witness that is such a young age or at all and\nIt's going to be a you know an indelible mark on your life forever\nBut I Hope that it will be equally as indelible the moment and the beauty of watching your daughter being baptized and confirm her place uh in our heart for God in front of all those people\nThat you should have power wouldn't you say\nYeah that that this [noise] I just couldn't believe it\nOr if you know some good have come of it because I decided to be a paramedic after that extra August ... three of\n'em so it did change my life forever but it also you know after her being adaptive baptized I'll never forget that day in my life that was a day that this set out to me and I felt that\nYou know God was talking to them you know I think it just was really strange thing to go through\nWhat was he saying\nUm [noise] he was saying to let this go you were saying don't harbour any guilt it wasn't my fault you know I was a child and I and I didn't rescue him I I panic\nBut and you didn't have the ability to rescue him right I didn't either and so it can't be your fault\nRight and I and I it took a long time to to realize that it wasn't my fault and what\nYou know just for a while to go I mean just to say goodbye to him um to pray for him and\nFor decorating

have a child now together\nAnd um [noise] I I um [noise]\nDo you have a tale saying things that are out there for I think my children every two weeks for you know they that's what they said that a

and you both can take the ... the you know you can either positively move in one direction together or you can\nMove into different directions chances are if we parsed your ... relationship we looked back there was a time when you saw\nSigns of maybe she not being the right one and then people bring children into the equation and all of that we don't have time for that but what I Do want to tell you is that\nUm if you live in the bowl of just staring at that circumstance she's married and she's moved on\n'em you won't be able to dig yourself out you know\nIf you get it to a place where your bedroom yourself you're not you know getting into the who you're not drink in your uh being productive and you're finding ways to me I Would encourage you to help others\nA and there's programs for people that have been cheated on and things like that that you can go into and talk and find out the things that people have gone through in how they've pushed themselves through it\nPrayer and church and all these things play a part of all this then you can move forward yourself and find\nYou know that happiness or or a partner in life but if you're going to focus on the past I'm On the program a lot of times and and I know pain is difficult to get through but there's a limit there's a certain amount of pain that comes from the experience and then the rest is that you putting it on yourself\nAnd um I like in the past two driving ... and when you're driving you have a rearview mirror but you use the rearview mirror only to move forward right to change lanes\nUm to make sure that you're driving safely but you would never drive staring in the rearview mirror ... wouldn't you because you find out if you just scared the rearview mirror you'd crash right\nAbsolutely and that's what you're doing right now you're driving I Know staring in the rearview mirror so\nI Know I don't want to I Want to move forward I really do\nSo today you need to you need to start in actually have a process whether it's setting up time to go to church and be a constructive there you need to find a charity or something where you can put your time into helping others not wallow in your own pain and you need to dedicate yourself to those things and continue to build up\nYour uh wants and desires in life and the things that that make you you Dale so that you'll be attractive to somebody but somebody who's ... who's ... ended up is not going to be attractive to any woman that's going to be good for you\nYou got to clean yourself up your daddy and your child to God and you gotta clean yourself up and then when we come\nAnd you'll you build your life and fulfill it by yourself and then you'll be ready for another partner but to sit in the pain isn't going to help and that's the best

to ... the Washington Post contributor who vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey Germany France and Britain are asking for a complete and detailed Saudi response to us also demanding transparency Fox says they're now Scott how's more live\nIt's important it is a a a vulgar display in many ways\nAnd to get into the details what's taking place or would make most people lose their breakfast however I assure you that the ... the everybody has made it a political issue which is to me almost equally as vulgar\nBecause what gets lost on both sides is the fact that there is no one in less there's some bizarre twisted in an individual there is no one on either side that wants to see a baby died you\nKnow one of\nThe confusion comes because there are ... what really sets the two sides apart it's the definition of when it's a baby\nSo the but no one setting out to kill babies and I it's the that's an ugly thought that's what people are really doing they are not ... it's just the definition\nYou know when it's a baby so science says something different than theology [noise] yet as a scientist you or they're representing the laws of the land and medicine to take care of your patients\nWell the love of land currently says that under certain circumstances um during certain times of the pregnancy\nThat to abort that pregnancy is okay uh-huh if you're in a public facility\nYour job is to uh give them the information they need to make the best decisions they can but the decision is not on us on the individual just like in anything your job is to give them the best information but the patient and say no I don't want to take the pill or no I don't want to follow up they can even tell you\nThat they don't want you to resuscitate them right correct\nAnd you could say that that's against God's will because now you're allowing them to make a decision to to not live\nCrack\nSo there's a lot of weight on you as a physician and uh in the nursing community as well that those that are in the medical profession to give the best information\nAnd that's what you're called to do it's not a point of preaching\nNow if you feel that there's an opportunity and you want to make sure that they have the best information on both sides that's fine but as far as allowing somebody in the United states to make that decision there are laws to protect them to be able to do so and if you're going to be a physician in a public\nOr in the public arena uh-huh they are going to be allowed to do that\nFor [laughter] at Harvard Medical office back not\nChris from a pet I mean we treat people are fake or not on my farm lever and so what would you say here that\nWell if they don't if they don't feel comfortable with doing that there might be a way of around ... for you to allow someone else to uh-huh or or things of that nature or wherever there's a point where if you're going to be in that industry\nAnd it is in the United states and it is legal then there's going to be issues and she can even or he can even make a claim and say hey it as a person of faith this upsets\nMe and I don't want to be a part of it and it's fair to a certain degree but there's a point where\nIf the laws are with the laws are and if you don't want to participate in that then you know if you had a job was witnessing there didn't believe in blood transfusions uh-huh now that becomes an issue and ... and that starts to infringe on the individual's right\nWho has a legal right to get a blood transfusion there going well I don't want to fill up the paperwork or I don't want to do this and that becomes a little sticky so if there are ways around it that can be done ... and just does not impede on the legal rights and individual rights\nThe person wanting whatever treatment that is legal\nUm ... you can adapt to those but you can't just hope the system based on your face because in that process um you're taking away the rights of an individual um that is legal in the United states and that that becomes a problem as well um to those that want to choose that so\nMy comment kids like ... like that but a lever right that's why I Would not have up on that question like that good but here I got like\nA Saturday eater I'm not sure that I worked when I went and all that you end up not\n... right yeah and if I wait or be land who hooked up with abortion I weigh referred to a colleague of mine down because people have the right to\nGrow whether I right or wrong and I am I right on that if I and I think what to\nComply with that I talked to someone out who are like\nThat with my comfort to like I Need to get you\nKnow I think that's a very honest way of approaching it because if you start becoming the the Christian police it becomes problematic now let's say you're a checker at a grocery store\nAnd now you're you're looking at\nTwinkies and ... and the person in front of you is overweight\nAnd you start going on I'm not going to sell this to you because you're obviously abusing it or any of those you start policing everybody's option and if the freedoms exist in the United states you have to allow that now you don't have to do it yourself in that sense but your your practice has to have somebody\nThat is able to write that referral or to do that otherwise it stopped being a practice\nAunts or a medical practice and starts being a religious practice um which becomes a problem and I think that your your your console was very fair and honest and looking at making sure everybody's taking care of and I think that was the right way to go about it I think you're\nYou're welcome and thank you for what you do it's a it's a\nVery important thing that you do in and I I Know that your face ties into it and you're praying for people and you're being there and that makes you a even more important out there is a position to have the balance between your scientific mind and your spiritual sense as well I think is a very important a part\nOf the medical industry this is a incredibly difficult subject but I really want people to here and we beat the left with the thought that nobody wants to kill babies\nNobody does I Know that's the easier way to think about it and to look at it it's not about that it's the definition of when they see a baby\nAnd it may be different than yours and that's part of the fight part of the fight is to to get science to see that in and I'm as they see that then that will change but as if the majority of doctors see that as tissue and not yet a baby then it wouldn't matter what you do indoor say\nThat's where it will change but nobody's going around smiling at taking the life of a child nobody wants that no one no matter how hard core they are on either side it's a matter of the definition of when it's child [noise]\n[noise]\n...\n\nMessaging to raise ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into
