wonder to fit how kids are going to react after an off week and I thought we came out and played by Ellen\nAnd jumped on quick and they will play a lot of people and uh and got through it with a healthy and so that was a good thing but I really thought we we had a lot of fire\nI tonight we're back on the road Monroeville to take on a team that's Monroe County team it's to inform the season own foreign region and a nearby all we talk about it you're supposed to win the games are supposed to win right and this was one of those games how do you get the team motivated for a game like that\nWell it's been hard it's been a rough week we've had hot and it's going probably more than we have a uh the last six because of a you know ... hard to ... with all the social media now now they know who were play and they know what the record is uh they know what the scores of being\nA and so forth so we we really tried to work hard on ourselves in a you know we're going to rest a couple of paper night or in the game so up a you know if one of those games you hope you're just good enough to get through it yeah\nAnd we had some some illness last week and some players um how how's everybody's looking this\nWas you know and talking about that we will hold up a ... he's still not back tomorrow and and also cameras night with NATO and and uh and will hold up a hunter Milton I pay ... grass and uh\nUh uh he could play we just we just want to give him a couple of weeks rough deal with that back in and make sure he's ready for the the the end of the say\nAll right well we've got two games on the road here and then we're back home for the final regular season game or to believe we only have three left what what you know we don't wanna look too far ahead the next three games what are you looking for years we get ready for the playoffs\nWell we want to make sure it'd be interesting to see how it can be a county does tonight uh their plan and delusions they only got one region laws so you know ... that means they're pretty good so they'll come in they're against us next week was the one loss and\nUh and the first typewriter when these things his head to head into a that could be a big game and then and then we end with W F deal who's a play a lot of young kids and\nAnd uh you know had been having a great season so so we'll keep just trying to get better get back on a regular thing and and then soda or hopefully we we want to win this region we want to make sure that it's all top Rikers now that we get home field advantage against\nOr anything that could happen you know that knew where if two teams are the higher seeds a home team evolve equal in travel so so that could come to apply if you go along these playoffs so so uh it'll be interesting to see and and uh and hopefully we'll just keep getting better and better to stay healthy\nOur coach we talked a little bit about last week to about ... skipper getting better and better we we threw the ball pretty well last week um as we get towards the playoffs does the playbook get a little bigger to so everybody has to work on a lot more things or do we Star Trek and things down\nYou know we can do we do a lot of stuff during the week\nThat we get in the game that I really don't they therefore you don't want to show it whether it's planes whether it's a formation\nYou know a lot of different things and the coaches who I'm going to do all that so you know we did a little bit of it last week but a lot of the stuff that that we're we we've been practicing oh we'll we'll put a little bit of it is we need it if not we'll hold it\nAnd you know the kid that they have a way to ... they'll run such and such and such and such you know but uh you know ... there'll be a time believing at some point will will lead to bust that stuff so you know\nMy wife gets me all the time about our trick play says well you had been run a direct flight I said I haven't needed the ... like yeah you know so\nSo we'll we'll\nWe'll probably for the law but I wouldn't say it you go in there it down you need to know what you can do do well but you also know that the other team the watching but every game you've got so

sudden Michael nap with you're on the bulldog radio network in a microwave our coach Kurdish talk about it a little bit this pre game there\nThis is this was a game we should win and he he talks at all talked about it with me all the time we know is there is a game you you got a windows games as a coach is staff\nTo win the games you're supposed to win and usually the other ones will take care of themselves\nWell and you have to be a a great psychologist this wicket at a coach the team look when you see these guys are with social media you know every game every score how it played out and you probably have even talked some of the players on the other team death on some of these platforms that kids have now to communicate and\nThey know that they're significantly better and you know that that they're probably going to win tonight if they play just even a decent game and sit through that during the practice leaky you gotta you gotta kinda hammer into their psychology to keep them working at the same level and they focused and sharp and getting better every week you advance to the playoffs\nAnd as you as the hard part about that is we are in the back of the season now we're we're we're three games out from being in the playoffs here and you don't want to go in you don't want to limp into the playoffs not playing your best football we saw last week was a good game you want to build on that you want to continue to get better and better here over the next three weeks even though they are three games we should what\nTodd is my biggest concern I'll talk about it for the next four or five six weeks that you know we will we will meet Eighteen somewhere in the playoffs round to round three and and my biggest concern is when we play that game it will have been\nSix weeks since we played a really strong opponent yeah and you know that that can be to our detriment if we're not staying focused every week on who we are and what we did\nThe captain's for tonight for the bold officer out on the field I see senior Tyler oven out there along with um lie to Stanley get to be a captain tonight and jak Klein and know about our and our captains here tonight for the dog show much right in their ... away whites\nOr is he is and a great pants Monroe County navy blue and gold kind of looks like the a team I'm cheering for on Saturdays the mid shipment of Naval Academy\nThat's right that doesn't it [laughter]\nAll right we've got a couple of minutes here before we were gonna kick this would offer let's take one more breaking it moved back with the kickoff you're just you're listening to hold on radio network news radio seven ten and news radio Seventeen dot\nWill will ... probably has the interception and Edwin comes through effort play and and knocks it away from him a that was tried to roll out that quarter back to his left and I guess he's a lefty\nLooks that way and he threw it with just less than a lefty a\nLot of pressure in his face and just kind of live it up their Senate for Kobe Williams the receiver that's flank or the split out why they left in a second ... now the receivable Kobe Williams will come on the left again I formation in the backfield\nJustin Davis the quarter back up under center\nHe'll give it to the deep back this time off the left side they bobble the hand off a little bit there's one two three four five six white jerseys there to stop the running back right it's a lot of scrimmage it'll bring up certain ...\nReally great fit budget barber right there in that gap will really makes the first contact me and just get to tackle\nI couldn't see who the first one there there were all swarming to the ball so\nUm [noise]\nNo gain on the play it'll bring up third down in ten now for the Monroe County tigers eight forty five to go here in the first quarter you a mess right with the seven nothing lead early in this ball game [noise]\nI Do like the play clocks were working this year they were not last year when we were here I formation again behind the quarterback Davis\nHe'll give it to back off the left side this time he'll get a couple of yards out across the globe and towards the Fifteen no more down there that was McLean running back with a D paying off again just off the left side bulldogs are holding do short gained it'll bring up for them\nThat's freshman James Finley with another play we said his name twice already playing a in places some injured defensive ends and and doing a great job Eric Wesley still out with an injury and ... out sick and genuinely starting to the second week in a row and that's a great job shedding the block and making tackle from his defense avant position\nSo planting situation again for the tigers on their second drive the um partner will stay in that the goal line and we'll get it to star Richard Brent subtle block it he'll stupid and they'll score Richard Branson comes on touch from our right side or the\nMonroe Cathy's left side and we had a great view that he was there as a quarter as the Potter dropped the ball on up his foot\nIn the opposite end of the end zone and is able to recover ... zone touchdown two weeks in a row\nAlmost takes it off his foot uh-huh ends up taking the the punch the belly and and it blocks the end of the end zone falls on top of it by himself and scores\nAnother six to the bulldogs in a lot like last week Todd yep six minutes into the game here five minutes into the game and uh we have special teams touchdown we have an all sense of touch down into three outs\nRichard Branson got credit with a scoop of score last week after ... a block of the park and so two weeks in a row now special teams get on the board for the bulldogs with block punch in touch downs off of the [noise]\nSo here's the extra point

ACL in the middle of the field solo tackled but man Richard Branson got declared it out on this outside right now I guess he didn't see the guy coming up field but he got best\nField starting field positions Monroe County they get it at their sixteen your mind to start this third drive of the game they'll send their one rod receiver wide to the left eye formation again two titans and about in the\nOffice of blonde the quarterback will turn to give it to McLean off the left side he'll cut it back to the right side he's got some ... out across the twenty little success there out across the twenty five in the market that up to twenty seven and that's enough\nFor the Monroe County tiger's first first down on the ball games\nWere rare mistake by the defense or over pursue yeah we we had

too\nAnd the dogs will Holden ... no gain on first down\nThere was a wall body blue and white jerseys right there really nowhere for him to go great job plugging holes and holding their spots on the defense of on\nThe good thing about this is um hopefully if they keep running the ball was the clock will run quickly [noise] fourteenth enough at our school already with uh [noise]\nI think that says six forty to go here in the first quarter we get a few lights miss it on the scoreboard some formation by Monroe County they'll give it to McLean deep back off the right side\nWho's got a little room this time out across the thirty\nThe markets to thirty one yard line that will be again of five maybe for the play bring up thirty six now for Monroe County\nReally small hole opened up all night and the mostly that was just forward momentum to carry them forward three yards after contact but still thirty long for them and\nThe center graph solving tonight Charles Miller and gets distorted to regard as it's been all year in line of Stanley is a right tackle for the bulldogs\nHere's the hand off to soften up the middle he's got a big hole inside the Fifteen down inside the ten they'll grab him there and the last show him down pulling back was actually at the six and so good run by Simon Smith gain of about ten on the plane takes it down to the seven no market right there to be first and goal for the bulldogs\nYeah again untouched for the first ten Europe's ... he finds a member of their secondary who makes the tackle but gives his first and goal and we're right on the seven yard line

right\nTrack dropped back by skipper snipes who's going to throw it to the righty throes of high and complete trying to teach shot on the slant route Monroe County actually dropped into coverage or they went to a little too deep and a good job I skip product to throw that one way and it'll bring up second gold\nAnd they were pressing on the top sat him down and we were I guess was Richard up on the top side I have a tough time getting free of that guy\nSo maybe they're picking up there and ... a little bit\nDown twenty ended up [noise]\nComing out some coming here tonight\nI saw the sign out front and said the bond fire was coming bonfire was last night now that could have been from last week I don't know how they all ended up there all week but not very many people here so we'll give it

enough on our score here for him in a row County Alabama ... leads the Monroe County tigers and we're still in the first half\nSo seven play\nKept up nor Bernard's to yard touchdown runs\nGood jobs

bulldogs almost picked it up finally the returns you may and falls on it they're going to market down at about the Thirteen maybe the Fifteen yard line\nSo I was listening to coach Rick Cleveland's show on Saturday mornings a couple of weeks ago and some guy called in with a trivia question about a native ... billion\nAnd I missed the question but the answer was packed galley real and it was something about a a professional baseball player who played out of Springfield College that was his dad that was back alleys dad okay we'll sit well with that guy must have been the son of that guy then yeah OK because that was the answer\nIs Pat Pat place with a set of golf clubs that his dad got as a signing bonus when he signed with the Dodgers wow\nNext year and the golf tournament you need the coaches term you need to look at that amount of by the back they're\nThey're ... they're the old I'm presuming heads and everything I'll be I'll be the D. player on anyone\n[laughter] Monroe County first intend there on the play off the right side and lose a yard back to the I Can't tell what yard line there even on their ... are left me on the other side of the field I Can't see the stripes they marketed the it's like the fifth inning your dog yep [noise]\nYeah we have packed valley coming up at that time in sixty eight state championships he's won as a head coach of either\nThrough and that number out that the actual numbers that is the number I'd like making that I\nThat ... champion you'd have to go in Nineteen Ninety One inducted into the you must write athletic hall of fame\nForty six years he's been a humorous right this is his forty six year Monroe County will go motion from right to left they're going to toss it around the right side to McLean into bulldog shifted their whole front over there to where the motion was going and that will be no gain on the play for McLean the running back bring up or down alone now from Monroe County\nLinebacker Tyler it's his first tackles a night yeah finish enough that play well the first of all we could see any way that is true yeah first one that I've given him credit or sell they sell otherwise they did you say that coach Kelley was inducted into the whole theme in Ninety One Nineteen Ninety One\nThat's right ... so twenty seven years later he's still rocking and rolling out you know [noise]\nHe has some good commentary though on the I tried to get him telling me that he home story but he wouldn't do it I think we're going to cut that out but [noise]\nPlay action flash Monroe County to quarterbacks enrolled is left great pressure in his face Davis the quarterback is going to have to cut it up inside he's going to get tackled for a lost all the way back inside the tent yard line they're gonna marking down at about the eight to bring up another funding situation I couldn't see who put the pressure on the other\nIt was a colorectal James cleanly gets them in the backfield [noise]\nThey tried for a little play action a booth the quarterback Davis out to their left or right side and they couldn't couldn't get the edge and so for sampling situation again John are the court the partner will come in and try to\nStanding in the back of his ends on yes for guy yeah Edwin white stands at the Monroe County thirty yard line and we'll see if he gets a chance to return this one [noise]\nPush they happened to the [noise]\nAlways bottled in the end zone to butter is going to run around and he's just going out on the back of the end zone and take a safety I thought they snapped it to the outback it didn't quite get there but no it was going to the Potter and he\nDanced around for a little bit and then decided the best movie wasn't just step out of the back to the end zone and it was taking the safety and that was that is now the force safety for the bulldogs are seizing\nThat may be a record that may be a record main weight and think about that now twenty nine enough at our score here for safety is on the season for the ... defense and a ... that's ... that's really kind of a crazy stat when you think about it\nSo I don't know if it's coach galley we'll talk about their race in Britain from last Saturday he will he\nJust he doesn't really say much about it but if you want to talk about more than welcome to\nYeah I got some some times in names

twenty finish the season Rand nights you know three and then rounding out our top five or I wouldn't Martin who's another sophomore yup uh and train Mitchell another sophomore so that's\nThat's all sophomores a freshman at a junior\nHand often McLean off the left side he's going to break attack on tried to spin out that's going to end up costing them a few yards he spun out of the first ... tried to go why did the right side he'll lose you already to all the way back to the sixteen yard line not to bring up for them for Monroe County\nSure on that tackle it it was it was either Todd Morgan or has been price it ended up getting credit for that tackle in the back side it looks like they'll send on\nTheir punter once again it's been quite an adventure for them and the hunting game tonight [noise] almost all of it in our favor [noise]\nJust got a score that Sarah Lande is up on St Paul's Twenty one to nothing and the second quarter [noise]\nI brought some of the regions that we can start kind of looking at some of the other regions in the states that were paired up with and\nHere's the ... had been whites going to go over to pick it up to forty does he's going to make the catch bring it back here to the left side he's got a little while they're going to throw a penalty flag on us it's a thirty five and one's going to take it all the way down the left side and tried to dive into the end zone he's actually going to step out of bounds it about two to ... add the wall and the left side but they're going to\nThrow a flag at the thirty three yard line I think they're going to call me legal block against you almost right\nYeah I think they're going to get Tyler Turner on that's a shame and he's competing his tail off against that kid and I guess you just got his hand a little too far outside and\nUh they needed a reason to throw flags [noise]\nSix thirty four to go in the second quarter you'll miss ray leach thirty seven to nothing [noise]\nCrafts Sullivan's okay he's back out there\nAs this key Sean would yard back out on the ... year yeah catching ... ... yeah [noise]\nThey did call any legal block against the bulldog so that'll take it back to
