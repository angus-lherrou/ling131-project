president saying dangerous people are in the group find to enter\nObama's going to take credit for this this is this is preposterous but is is there should be laughable\nWhat it's all they've got on the left and that's why Obama is out there on the campaign trail given speeches trying to trying to just tip the balance of the house to the to the Democrats\nAnd he's the guy who's were on there saying yeah that's right\nGood economies because of me to be before even let Obama make his case from South religious understand this if the economy were what they said it would be under Trump which was\nYou know in in a freefall recession bad things happening do any of you believe for one second that their story would be well it's not Trump's fault it's Obama's economy\nOf course not just this is ridiculous so\nGiven we can establish that we also know that we should not have to take it seriously and now they're saying oh that's right it's it's the\nIt's the Obama economy that we are all enjoying right now please please that is ridiculous um but here's Obama making that case like look too\n[noise] so by the time on wages were arriving\nOn insurance rate was falling\nPoverty was falling [noise]\nAnd that's what I and it also makes [noise]\nSo when you talk about economic miracles right now\nI mean this is a Obama at the at the economic level is the guy\nWho's you know who who's a who's white comes over to open up the ketchup bottle because he can't\nGet it and then he goes you know I lose did it for you it's like it does it really doesn't really cutting edge not really\nHow this goes I I just think that that's so indicative of they got nothing right now\nThey've got they've got to try to they've got to act like Obama's still the president still going to make\nThe decisions because the decision that I've been married for two years are good\nAnd they're helpful and people have jobs and the money and the more money in their pocket and they have less west or be crushing tax burden on the corporate tax rates now in line with the rest of the advance world we always hear about how great the rest of the industrialized world is on healthcare and there's other things but on their corporate tax rate or or do we need a really high one\nWay to hire corporate tax rate that you know Denmark does I mean that that that's the kind of stuff but the Democrats ended up having to say I I guess they feel like they really have no choice but Larry Kudlow\nWho is one of the ... one of the more stellar Trump Administration officials out there could could lower saying that Obama's\nFrom the recession was the worst one since the great depression the worst one and basically a hundred years there were ... they never had three percent GDP gross under Obama's time it'll never not once in eight years that's coming out of a terrible recession the stock market hit you know thirty forty or thirty percent I think it was at the at the real downturn of

one winner one point is it six or for one point one point six billion dollars\nSix billion\nDollars that arise oh a lot of times it rises over the last minute but it was at least one of the biggest the lottery award in history going to one person in South Carolina so you're\nGetting probably nine hundred\nIf you take it all in one lump yes ... ... yeah it's nine hundred and something million nine Thirteen I think it is and how much do you get if you take it\nYearly believe it's twenty two point six million dollars for every year yeah a Thirty Years' so twenty forty five can I tell you something\nI normally say take the money and run and I would take the money or if it were me I Would take the money and\nRun because I don't know if that things are going to sit around for twenty more years gone Dell was what could happen in Twenty years yeah I'm however twenty two million dollars\nA year ear live in white\nLard and I will say to actually has a ... ah I'm noticing there's a note at the top of this was his originally written for a previous story they just updated it to hit so the twenty two point six million was on a seven hundred million dollar jackpot so we are talking more than double that you're probably about close to about fifty million per year ... who are ...\nYour ...\nYour fight yeah take the new ... it's funny hasn't the advice always been you you're an idiot if you take the anybody yes I'm this article goes through a and analyzes it and talks about how the tax benefits are there for you to take the annuity\nUm you're going to get a return that you can't necessarily get into bank account from the annuity and that's pre tax and ... ... if you build your only built one year\nRight and you know they actually pointed out to a this is actually pretty funny article of this leads us to the biggest advantage of the annuity protecting you from yourself\nAgain I don't know all about you but I Do know you buy lottery tickets so let's consider the possibility that you were not one of your generation decreed financial mind\nI'm ... and it goes on to say the other thing is uh you will have an excuse to not give every single person who comes up to you money 'cause you don't get it all at once so instead of having a billion dollars ... billion dollars a year is that\nTax free [noise] uh I have to pay taxes on the fifty million thought to pay taxes on it [noise] well I can only twenty five million right up again and but I mean for you know\nThere is at least some limit right like I had to get more next year but I did just by a fancy house in a fancy car and this I gave money to this person and like you're gonna have to wait twenty five million dollars a year after\nTaxes you are living large yeah that's that's a cross the line where you're you're basically doing anything you want but exception of by multiple private jets and like that super duper high end stuff\nUh you're not you know you're not going to get\nYou you probably could if you've got fifty\nMillion dollars a year if you only income and you could certainly do it yeah but I mean you're not buying you can't pay for them in cash and you know but you wouldn't want to have you have a guaranteed Twenty years of fifty million dollars why paying\nCash yeah\nI mean it seems like any bank is going to give you the low\nJust feels weird to pay someone interest on anything when you're in that financial decision but yeah I guess you could certainly get it what do you care or it's not going to be all that much I guess in the grand scheme of things but congratulations to uh whoever
