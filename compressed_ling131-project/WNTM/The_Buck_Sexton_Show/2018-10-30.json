holding the line for America bug sex is back\nAnd that's what the rhetoric is doing is giving\nPeople a license or certainly unbalanced people certainly people on the fringes of American Life but it is telling them that what you're doing a is okay and that's why yes there are always been an anti Semitic incidents in American history\nNationalism goes hand in hand with anti senators have the entire idea of anti Semitism is to put choose outside the body politic outside the death of ... and that's what Donald Trump dies that his fame that's what his party is now committed to doing\nA limit nation is rhetoric and the president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point he doesn't dog whistle teams as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence directly\nDirectly leading to violence they say it is not\nSomewhat or partially Trump's wall I mean I saw a a an editorial about this over the weekend in the Washington Post no less saying that\nUh it is directly somewhat you know that they'll always put his qualifier each Trump's fall to what extent\nOr you know Trump should hold some some level of of the blame here uh this is this is disgusting it's disgraceful but when you have the individuals\nIn the media who have taken Trump's entire presidency so personally as an affront to their greatness and their values and how wonderful they are are there are no limits really on the Bible they will throw at this present there are no there's no good faith there's no decency whatsoever that they will extend to him an end to his supporters\nTo all of us remember it's not just about Trump underneath all of this there's always this evening\nHatred of the Trump voter to oh that's a part of the anti Trump movement they they despise the boat or they don't cause they don't think that really we've been fooled\nThey figured out enough now I Believe the left is in the media and the Democrat Party I figured out that we've made this bargaining were good with it were like yeah I like Trump I Know he's not perfect and then we make mistakes but I think Trump is actually the right choice for America right now\nSo they hate us because of all of that and that's why they feel completely justified and saying just the most despicable disgusting things I mean here's here's a another Washington Post personal over at MSNBC play three\nThere's always been the old right or its equivalent the differences it was always on the fringe in the mainstream elements of the party and certainly the president's\nAh never validated that ah what's happened and what's so extremely dangerous about this is you now have the man with the largest megaphone in the world\nGiving a nod in a way sometimes outright praise or to the folks who are carrying on these conspiracy theories edited is telling them these people that it's okay that they're getting a a blessing to do this\nYou know it's it's interesting that that you can go on TV that Dana Milbank Washington Post and say that Trump gives them a blessing right after he is explicitly openly repeatedly condemned this\nBut you see this is one of the games that they play they'll say why doesn't Trump ... why does in Trump condemn white nationalist\nAnd people will say okay well he did he just condemned them a couple of days ago well well he hasn't denounced it enough and then people will do a little Google surgery and will say well we're on a second Trump is called white nationalist losers he said there's no place in America for hate and he said this many many times and they'll say well the ... from talk about white nationalist so much\nYou can't win folks you you know there's nothing he can do that will make them stop\nCalling him a racist stop calling him a white nationalist they\nThey do not extend the most basic\nLevel of good faith do them in any of these discussions and and they love to try it out these these fake conservative I mean these fake Republicans like Jennifer Rubin who is that she is the queen of fake Republicans Washington Post still list or as a Republican when she writes thing which is just amazing\nBut you know she she blames Trump not just for\nWhat happened over the weekend what happened last week but for the overall increasing hate in America she says like the poor\nAnd that kind of some sort of the shower side of Donald ... faith that we've had at fifty seven percent tech and they'll ask hair and anti snack hate crimes for the biggest\nThe children that's what he does by having senior Jewish advisors in the White House by being a better friend to Israel by leaps and bounds than Obama ever was\n... for for president who's probably the most popular American president in Israel the state of the Jewish people for president of that stature to be called an anti Semite just goes to show you how desperate the left release to try to make this stick\nAnd I know that there is a fight within the Jewish community right now about well he's actually spoke to a rabbi about it today or on my other show and what we do well he's good on Israel but they don't like some of his domestic policies but they do like some of his other domestic policies but they don't like is\nA you know just tweeting at his ... and you know and that's great the Jewish communities vibrant with political disagreements like like any vibrant community would be over politics is not a monolith in any sense\nBut there's not this overwhelming belief at all that he's anti Semite that's just that's fantasy land stuff but just not true it's not reality\nAnd they're so desperate to try to make this what people believe what they think and what you're seeing here in this last couple of weeks before the midterm election is that Democrats really all they have is that Trump is hateful Trump is terrible they hate Trump\nSo they want people to vote against Trump\nWho still it here to senseless racism\nAnd religious prejudice\nTo those individuals will persist and such hateful behavior [noise]\nIf I were speaking to them instead of to you [noise]\nYou are the ones who are out of step with our society [noise]\nYou are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of a dream that as America [noise]\nAnd this country because that's what it stands for will not stand for your time to [noise]\nThe greatest president my lifetime with the possible exception of Donald Trump will see how it how it goes we'll see how many years in office he has hopefully eight and we'll see what the full\nMeasure of his accomplishes look Reagan defeated Soviet Union and probably save the planet from annihilation so\nThat that's a ... that's a tough one to that's a tough one to be that's a tough record to compare against\nBut Trump so far is doing a pretty remarkable job in his own way but I play that for you just because I I think that it is helpful for all of us in fact I I Would argue that it is necessary for all of us to remind each other and those of us who are conservatives\nThat our movement and our ideology our belief system our principles\nAre rooted in a respect for the individual individual rights human dignity human life liberty that's that is the foundation of our of our belief system that we're all star and so\nTrue anti Semitism and true racism and I say that with a qualifier true because we know the left calls everything I Do some calls everything racist I mean they're they use it as a\nPolitical ... true anti Semitism and racism and uh\nAnd and and bigotry is not just non conservative eighties anti set a goal to conservatism because\nIf we are not all God's creation in doubt by our creator with the ... rights and if we are not all equal in\nThe eyes of God and in the eyes of the law then there was no such thing really as conservatism and conservatism as we know it in this country does not\nExist it it is not possible to be a conservative and believe that a white person or any any black person or a black person than a Hispanic person and a white person at that\nThat they do not all have equal dignity equal rights equal worth\nAs human beings and as citizens of this great nation so when\nThe last try so hard to create this perception that people who are conservative I I Can't speak to the right means the right\nIt would mean meaning all of it I was I can speak the write in general terms but you know there are some fringe elements of the right that you that that day 'cause of themselves on the right and you'd say well hold on a second in what meaningful way are they conservative though\nYou know this is where you start to really get into what is right wing or left wing even mean\nYou know if you are more in favor of individual rights if you were about the individual instead of the collective right the left in this country is all about the collective and there are about collective guilt collective identity collective economics they are collective is\nThey believe in groups they believe in the common good as defined by a core of elites that all speak in the language of equality in commonality but leave\nAs elites in separate from the masses but use the envy and antagonism of the masses in order to\nBeat the other side politically which would be us\nWe are the individual is we are the individual rights we're all God's creation we're all human beings in this struggle together and should help each other and respect each other at each other's rights and dignity and life\nAnd that has an obligation on all of us um when when they\nTry to make this case that racism and anti Semitism in these different ... and bigotry exist on the right I just I have a\nA real feeling of uh of outrage at that because it's show on true and so unfair and I think that the reason they push it so it's not just because it works it's dirty politics but it is useful for them\nA it is a shame that so many of the\nClasses that the Democrats view as victims whether it's just the working poor or African Americans or a or Hispanics Latinos women whatever the group maybe it's a shame that so many of them have been propagandize to such that they they really believe that I Know this from talking to them\nThey really believe that conservatives are racist they believe that\nYou and I said you knowing that that is a lot that's not true we're not racist in fact we're the ones that are always advocating for people of all races to be treated equally under the law is the left\nThat advocates for disparate treatment in the eyes of the law based upon race based upon skin color based upon not even real but perceived gender\nThey're the ones that want these differentiation and then they turn around and say that we're the ones who are obsessed with with race\nGender on these other differences among among human beings when at the end of the day I I think he couldn't be any more clear that our side the side of conservatives unconstitutional is are the ones that advocate for individual rights and the dignity of all people and\nThere has always been this effort to rewrite the histories of the ... the two party this is why Democrats do get show ... triggered when you just brought up that they are the part of the Democrats are reporter a party of slavery segregation Jim Crow just go down the list it was it was historically always the Democrats\nDemocrats have been and are the party of the mob mob mentality the mob feeling how does the mass feel how do the masses view an issue what did they demand what did they show what where's their rage direct that has been the aid that has been at the core of the Democratic party\nThere's always been an intellectual straining conservatism that has been first and foremost about the American founding in the constitution and\nThe rights of each and every individual and the natural law that underpins all of this that it's not really just about what the founding fathers said it's at the founding fathers were able to heart is a sense of what is a universal and eternal truths about human beings\nWhat is always true about people what is always good for society to promote and what does always necessary for society to try and prevent it to condemn those universal truths are at the heart of conservatism\nAnd so it's just [noise] he is he's act opposite of a true conservative to believe the first thing is less than because they get into the person who's less than as of January a less than because of religion [noise]\nThat is not who we are\nAnd I know that you know that as I Know that that I Do think that is worth\nSometimes taking a step back and just\nVerbalize exactly why that is the [noise]\nThere's a lot of ... and frauds out there and a lot of very easy and clever ways for people that

C. down in Houston every night Mr Jesse Kelly ... have you on\nThe right to be here buck happy to do it rather\nUh so I you know I'm I'm always a little\nFrustrated 'cause I'm not surprise surprise not the right works I Know that after a terrible shooting incident wherever it is there there's always the suggestion of oh why do you bring up armed guards or as though that some crazy idea or you know I've\nI've seen plenty of armed guards and or armed police at major religious sites where I grew up in New York City I just don't know Jesse why this gets dismissed by the ... I guess I Do know but it frustrates me that the leftist dismisses this out of hand we really do just want to save lives\nThen that's where it gets dismissed for simple reason is because it's the truth it's just like the left most dismiss off things that are the truth it is a simple\nObvious solution that would obviously solve the problem and therefore the left is forced to hate it because they have to live in a world of make believe we have armed guards everywhere we truly care about everywhere you truly want to protect the place that the target or potential target\nHas an armed guard inside of it or close by that cold security that's the norm that's the real world\nBut even bringing up an actual solution is just going to get your reactions a horror from the left who they think the only solution to disarming every law abiding citizen\nI just can't imagine the circumstances where I'm In a place\nThat generally speaking a lot of people do not you know you're you're you're not expecting necessarily depends where you are right I I don't know what it was like in this Pittsburgh synagogue I'm guessing probably none of the you know none of the parishioners are ever arms are and I I don't know or another congregants I shouldn't say river arm\nUh but I Know there are some churches in the south where I was people are All right I mean it it depends on where you are but the the idea that this is automatically a bad idea I think it just goes to show how ideological out of the reaction to this is because if I'm sitting there and I see somebody who's got a side arm\nAnd ... that's that's either a law abiding gun owners showing their side arm war is trained security or orbit perhaps off duty law enforcement the last thought that ever goes through my mind is oh well I'm less safe now Jesse I mean this seems very basic\nWell it seems basics you book because you were CIA and you have comments that you do you acknowledge the way the world really is\nBut I I one thing I have come to grips with is how frightening guns of anytime dar for those who have never experienced it never held them never shot one never been taught the basic safety about them it really is a terrifying thing for people who don't know they look at it\nAnd honestly it sounds crazy they see the thing is just going to start shooting\nI Know I I think you make a really good point and you know I Know you're not just a Texan but also\nWere a marine so you've got double firearms familiarity baked in there but you know you you look at at the the cultural differences in the very very blue areas versus a lot of the rest of the country you know when I tell people that I went to a a camp\nAs an eleven year old where we were firing rifles they look at me like I'm nuts when they think this is crazy sounding but it just goes to show that part of the political and cultural divide we have now in this country is exactly what you said it's not just that people don't have similarity with guns all that's a big part of it\nThey've also been raised to think where they've they've been led to believe by their peers in those around them\nThat guns except in the hands of the states are always a bad thing really I mean that's really the belief and also by the way Jessie the people who are part of the state apparatus meaning there aren't police or military who want to have guns or at best suspect and at worst a threat\nYeah my kids are not they've both shot firearms before real gun not just Bebe gun they've shot guns they're familiar with them they have had gun safety drilled into their heads\nKnows she's supposed to hold back a little more it's not supposed to go they're not supposed to be you know it obviously pushing for her own future and the White House at this stage of the game because she comes from a damaged political brand uh but you can't help herself\nHillary Clinton as I have said has a hole in her soul the only thing that will fill it in her mind is the ultimate power of the presidency\nAnd there's nothing else that you could ever have or could ever do that would make what she has been through because I'm sure she views herself as a kind of victim and a and I'm a martyr for the left wing progressive cause politically speaking you know she stood beside bill she allowed\nSo many people to uh bash\nAre all these years I mean I'm saying this is in her in her mind the only thing that is just the only way that justice is done\nIs if she becomes president United States and\nI I've been saying it and I just want to make sure that I'm very clear very on the record year what\nHappens is that the Democrats if they take the house marchers right into fights over impeachment that becomes the whole discussion we're just going to be fighting over impeachment really for the next Eighteen months\nAnd then the narrative is that the only way to set right what they could not get because they will not have two thirds of the Senate so they can't remove Hillary but the only way to set it right would be to make Hillary president finally to break that LA and finally\nPut her in a position where she gets to be the\nPresident of the United states I'm I'm not the only one who's thinking this Hillary yourself you could tell\nIt's like well I mean I'm not saying I'm running I'm just saying that I really want the jobs bill and nobody is more qualified than I Am I mean this is\nThis is a kind of stuff you say when you want something that you know you're not supposed to walk\nAnd or at least you're not supposed to say you want it that's where we are with us she she has not given up one bit\nShe still thinks that this is the way that it's all going to go and and what a what a a a a crazy story in her mind has got to be for running against\nBrock Obama losing run against Trump and losing and in the end though\nIn her mind justice prevails and she sets right the world and you could tell that she said oh you know there's so much work to do and her ... her mind set her attitude is alright America you know I'm the one that's got to fix fix the mess that\nThat Trump created and oh by the way you own this to me you owe me the presidency\nThat hasn't changed one bit and she is very much still in that mindset so I Know it's a little early but keep in mind that next year or this coming Tuesday went out yeah next Tuesday\nThat's next Tuesday the midterms will be over and the presidential election will begin next Tuesday is when we start to talk about who's really going to run the Democrats I think that what you're going to have a huge field of candidates on the\nDemocrats' side I think you're going to have a a massive field of all kinds of people including some real characters I'm not totally convinced that I have a nod he still thinks that are doesn't still think that he's going to run on I'm not convinced\nAs crazy as that may really be to anybody who's living in the real world I Would not be surprised if you did in fact have an ... candidacy I I could see I could see that happening and I think that you look at some of the others out there Elizabeth Warren\nProbably still going to run again focus conscious herself still going to run because\nShe thinks that in the Arab Trump\nAll that matters is that you deliver for your side and no matter how humiliating her whole fake Native American or deal may have been she thinks that she can still deliver\nA socialism for America that's that is what the fights going to be make no mistake about it this is going to be about this election will be about socialism the last election was about the crony corrupt ... Clinton's\nThat was quite a liberation but you know what I mean the last election was about the progressive media elite establishment finally getting getting the upper cut that is so deserved after all these years and the next election is going to be social is\nNo doubt in my mind it's going to be open forget about the kind of Bernie Sanders cuddly I just want free school stuff is going to be open a Seventy percent tax rate kind of redistribute the wealth reparations for all kinds of historical wrongs a massive\nGovernment intervention the healthcare markets open borders so that you can dilute whatever pain the productive citizens feel by just drowning out their votes with with new arrivals are that's\nGoing to be with the next elections all about a ... with that in mind by the way that I think of some of these\nSome of these never Trump ... are just getting crazier and crazier you know that they've gone from Russia collusion and now they have to find something else to justify their their hatred\nAnd I mean Max Boot I feel weird even talking about him because he's such a weirdo and show in significant\nTerms of his influence and his thinking in the in the conservative movement\nFact the only ... was to get us into wars that were or at least in one case very bad idea um but you know he'll just slander Trump with stuff like the\nFox News on our crowd Breitbart and enforcing the Daily Caller Republican congressman there been vilified George Soros for years and basically because George Soros because they're rich through and so when they talk about Soros they're talking about\nA rich Jew who is in control of everything or when they talk about global us which is a trend that first right when ... when Trump says Kobus right wing extremists here here's this is\nDog whistling which has gone soft and you're right it's not just ... a lot of Republicans it's a lot of folks that Fox News they really everything that ... there was a mere\nBy the way everything people don't refer to\nAnti Semitism when there's criticism of Sheldon Adelson who is a very wealthy Jewish Republican donor\nThat's apparently not anti Semitic this notion that global is there's some kind of dog was a global is is a term it's been used in international relations\nAre for decades and has nothing to do with someone being Jewish ... Jimmy Carter was a global issue I mean there there are lots of people that you could look at an referred you historically that work for you then as global the nothing to do with Judaism or certainly with anti Semitism um but ...\nIs that if you're going to go to the other team it's not enough to just say I don't like Trump you have to say I despise Trump I hate Trump I'll do anything I'll say anything I Will bend the knee and beg forgiveness from a left and be a turn coat and slander all my former friends and allies\nI don't know how these people sleep at night\nI Can't imagine turning on all the people that I respect and work with no now and and ideologically in line with and later just turn around because it was convenient for me and\nCall them all races [noise]\nThis ... [noise]\nI was visiting with books about his show on home titled fried would the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere is\nCalled home title fraud and it's simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy in home title walk found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your whole had it been real\nThis is the foot of taking out loans using books home was equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments or addiction notices showed up\nNow it's All right I I Know how it is with you guys Emily you in Boston gang up on New York [laughter] you know true yeah I Know\nI Am not I'm not well we we have a history with LA in Philly or we've beat them they beat up so I was not a big LA fan so I was gone with the Boston for the stairs\nAre as fair enough I wrote produced Mike I'm grab one of us know something about sports 'cause I I remember when I when I heard that before the show when I heard that somebody was like I'm not that might explain this one has\n... me gave me can Joe I think that they've decided that their brand is the director of lunatics on TV and that's a very crowded space right now is you know that's not an easy thing to be number one it\nSo that drama they bring to the table I mean they did the Ames I mean they look so miserable they've noticed that when they're on air how happy they look yeah well you know generally like to go through life bucking sorry\nGenerally being double home Rutgers is a bad start to things I'm just putting there you go there you go just putting that out I Know I Know I Try not to go to personal but you know that's not good that's not a good thing that I'm not\nA what's the word bad karma yes bad karma speaking of um I have no good transition here but you know she because I was like wait NBC CBS they're\nBoth networks other than that and they're both full lives but CBS had this uh this segment\nAbout hate speech in taking down hate speech and this has been one of the issues that has you know I've been talking to you about for a long time here where we you know you have this core is particularly on the left of oh you've got to get rid of certain kinds of speech on line\nUm and and you're not doing a good job of it and then we find oh wow you mean it's going to be abused and that they're just going to use this to shut down conservative stature shock\nNo one oh but that's what ends up that's what ends up happening a time and again and so they they they can't get the true anti Semite soft line they can't get ISIS and these other groups are to be\nTaken out of their their the cyberspace but they would they can do is is all of a sudden have second a pro Second Amendment groups that find their Twitter accounts or their Facebook accounts deactivated but\nHere's part of this a discussion and I have a slightly different view of this in terms of what the actions of these platforms should be ...\nYou can be radical online radicalized online has already been supported by\nThat's that swing bleed that after nine eleven when people had access to ISIS supporters and those who are trying to radicalize Jeff isolated individuals we know now that Facebook Twitter and YouTube all had agreed with that have worked with the government can take a lot of these videos down why not when it comes to right or left wing extremists on line\nWell for one it's very hard it's hard to identify what is extremism it's hard to identify what exactly is hate speech words are very complicated and different context and in particular case of Bowers\nYeah it's very easy to identify what he was doing he should have been found that should have been taken down but as a general principle it's very difficult to identify what if a speech what is not hate speech and to set foreign policies on that\nIt's difficult and we know that if we give them any leeway on this issue it will invariably be used to the detriment of conservatives it it will be\nA situation where conservatives are the ones who find themselves the rules will certainly be much more strictly enforced against the right if they're in force against the left at all and and here's you know a very good example of exactly what I'm\nTalking about is the fact that Louis Farrakhan still has lots of social media are still is able to ... view his hatred and tolerance and this is also why I just find\nSo much of the media's effort over the weekend to try and create this narrative of right wing extremism is responsible for all or almost all of the anti Semitism in this country when that's just not the case not the case at all and\nYou know here are the kinds of things that Farrah Khan who\nYou know gets deposed in photos with rock Obama when he's running for the presidency remember that oh that's right journalist hid that in the public because they didn't want us to see what was really going on there\nUm but Farrah Khan is still treated as somebody by the media who should have and does have a voice he's not the platform he's not pushed off of all the different social media outlets but here's the kind of stuff that\nMinister Farrah Khan says play fourteen\nAnd one\nWhere you recognize say\nAnd one where you see the same panic Jew and the synagogue of Satan which has many racist\n[noise] 'cause they and then the the\nThe whole world think about what they're going to say\nWhen they have been so\nAnd come clean\nWhenever you read that God has told the Jews to here and ... and they said I hear and I know they [noise]\nThat's St Louis disobeying God\nPretty gross pretty clearly anti Semitic the St panic Jew Farrah Khan says and he's still somebody that prominent Democrats\nCan hang out with an public can can speak with whether it's commentators were politicians are you'll notice that you don't have Democrat\nPresidential contenders asked a way that the way that Republicans were asked about David Duke a loser that nobody cares about nobody you know gives a you know what to hear from\nAll Republicans have to be asked in every presidential cycle will do ... do you do just about David ... why is it every Democrat asked you disavow do you disavow Louis Farrakhan why wasn't Brock Obama asked do you disavow Louis Farrakhan why wasn't Hillary Clinton asked do you disavow\nCirca\nOh that's right you mean the media
