unwilling to just discount this out of hand and that's why I I refuse to take the position that\nWell because the left has already started not just to blame the right for this but to blame the president of the United\nStates for this that's where I think we have to draw a very hard and fast line\nThe Democrats have created not alone but primarily predominantly they have created this vicious toxic\nPolitical environment they have never thought for one moment there was anything decent are acceptable about Trump they wanted to remove him from office I even had an author on impeachment on my

of him about it yeah it does bear responsibility for the divisions are as the biggest megaphones\nTrump they say is not responsible for the bombs but he is responsible for the bombs\nThat the

and I know which half or would you because he likes this game he'd say no one blames Trump for the bombs oh okay that's right no one thinks that Trump was in the west wing\nPutting together these bombs with his bare hands or whatever okay we're in the east wing no one thinks that what's happening but they're all saying including the president of the CNN network that the environment around all

they won't be able to prove that sweating collide because her charges were so vague or the statement that she swore was so vague I was at a party in the eighties and there were a gang rapes and I

would that even mean that was such a crazy thing to say in the first place he spiking what he's drinking the punch\nHow would you spiking the punch he's gonna he's going to poison we're very or get super drunk all of his male friends too so that they pass out and can't move\nThink about that she didn't she didn't say spiking of drinks spiking an entire punishable that every three maybe he was putting alcohol in it so that everybody could have some alcohol but he was the whole thing it's just it none of it rang true it was a fabrication out of this woman's mind she's deranged she neurons I

way\nThey are being told exactly what to say all they have to do was establish a record and that just means saying they don't even have to ...\n\nIt's it's sort of switched around it used to be that Central American immigrants at the border would would ah would lie and say they were Mexican because if they were going to be detained and sent back they didn't want to get flown back to Central America because they spend a lot of time and money often do you get to the border\nAnd so they would rather just be released back into Mexico you their Central America but now that's changed because of this asylum claims situation and as long as as long as they can\nI'm\nConvinced the border patrol agent or a few border patrol agents and the uh immigrations and Customs Enforcement process that they are from Honduras um they're going to be part of this asylum deal right they are going to get brought in and\nLetting the danger of the United states and as I've been telling you that's not going to that's just there's never going to be real enforcement alright what can be done about this I must be the hero bucket or whatever\nThe issue the ultimately the thirty thousand foot level Congress needs to change the law so that it is very clear that asylum they they need to change the asylum process so that you apply in your in your country or in the nearest country you can get two\nOut of us embassy and that there is a process it it should not be that you just present yourself in this way out of port of entry\nUm because you're in walking within walking distance the United states that's not that's not the way that this law should be but uh as importantly there's something called a safe third party say third country agreement\nIs well I like to tell you things on the show that you won't hear from other people because I actually read lots of things and do lots of research because if you were kind enough to spend your time with me I have a mandate to make sure that it's time well spent team\nSo the say third a third country agreement would mean and we have one with Canada by the way so this is not some crazy concoction and we've we've discussed\nThe possibility of this uh at the government to government level with Mexico\nBut what it would mean is that we would set up\nAt the border but on the Mexican side of the border and we yes we would probably have to pay for this book they should they should pay for it will go a lot faster and much more effective if we pay for it we would set up\nA centrally trailers you know a a holding facility sounds like it's not attention facility but it's a\nWhat would be somewhat similar to a a refugee camp situation it would be a place where people you know they have uh they're they're able to stay say there's water there's food um but it's on the Mexican side of the border and we would move infrastructure down to the border so that you have\nAt port of entry courts\nSo you would start you would move the judicial infrastructure to deal with these immigration cases right down to the border\nAnd people that were waiting for their adjudication ... so that would speed it up obviously and people that are waiting for their education process would be on the Mexican side of the U.S border which means that they don't\nUh they're they're not able to just go further and further in the interior United States and get some you know immigrant rights lawyer to represent them pro bono to keep suing the federal government all the rest of it if their claim is denied guess what\nThey get to stay in Mexico or or the Mexican government then can can hand them off to their country of origin that way you prevent what's happening right now which is using the legal system and it's very important we understand that they are not illegal immigrants\nThey may cross illegally\nSo then they are in the U.S illegal but at the moment that they say I have a credible fear of my safety these Honduran immigrants go into the asylum process and then they're due process\nAllows them to stay in the United states that is the law I've talked to senior immigration officials about this is talk of wars about this that's how this works so we need to take action here beyond ...\nPercent chance yeah I had aligned to allow and all that ... percent chance I can say that I find all it all the evidence on the line to care that at all although\nIt that's all fouled having anything to care of anthill if I can I cried out for a special ... ... if I get to the border I'm at an honorable guy as well actually I got an outlet and fats will have to understand\nYeah I mean like ... pulled so\nOkay I mean a bruise your Mike right I Want to bring you as an as an impartial observers here you know you can tell it's a little there's a little bit back and forth but I mean there's nothing to do crazy they're right sounds good good conversation is it exactly it's the guy's a spirit of conversation and then things get a little a little more tests play Ninety\nThere was another tweet that said the Democratic party it's comprised of racists white liberal fat is correct and I ... well let's go back and ... and like many people in the ... to ... ... it's kind of ... that I Am concerned about the color and the White House\nUm ...\nThey had about ... ... why why we get ten wailing that that's why don't you ask that question because they care about that\nBecause you're bringing a whole crowd that young African American leader so I felt that I talk about ... light levels don't realize that you put on that\nThe way that they are a little off guy had hacked fattening places only on how they're going to crash it that way I look I football had any kind of social that way full title shameful\nAnd that was fine that Russia anyway I don't know if they don't let the little quaint and ... not the type of fat and try to challenge Congress ... surrounded by way\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I felt like I got a little like I look at their word yelling it was civil but I felt like a little bit tension there producer Mike yeah definitely it was fun I liked watching it and I like looking at the [laughter]\nThe this is the problem whatever whatever we have is that good like this\nAnd I'm like well that's not really the ... the show every book shut up people who are fighting [laughter] I'm like well wait I thought I thought we were the trust tree I thought this was a mess that it I think we're all going to supposed to like you know\nBlock slap each other and I'm not even ... there there was born there and I'm like okay because the control room because they kept going beyond replay their their control rooms like we've got to go to break we got to go to Greg and I'm like okay we're going to break Chris was like no not done I was like damn okay here we go so uh yeah it was a\nIt was spicy spicy one day\nWhen they will get we'll get producer Michael one of these panels man that oh man my could we do that absolutely right yeah\nThe bosses would never be the film that would be the same again buck I Know exactly what Mike Mike slaps will be like new truck bomb it often left living\nI'm real quiet on assuming tell them not yeah no no you do your your feisty and I know the Irish are I'm I'm ... I'm One one thousand Native American but I'm half are good things that takes right see I I Want to make sure that we got producer Mike in with\nThe with the objective opinion there because you know for me it's like I mean I obviously ideologically agree with Candice I'm and and I I think that she's very talented and but I also am very ah very fond of Cristo even though I think that her politics or\nOr I'm\nWrong [laughter] so you know we were just it was it was\nQuite an exchange there and um we'll see tomorrow I'll give you a little preview later on in the show what the expectation is for a for tomorrow there might be I might be involved in a a shall we say more\nMore spirited discussion tomorrow things I might be the one that actually has to do a bit of a a bit of debating but we've got a\nI don't we don't really have time to get to the ... ... it's a fun thing to say the men that guys\nThat guy's been treated ... says well you know we we can actually do a little bit of it so I interviewed Papadopoulos we're this one today and here's what he said about the notion of Russia collusion play twenty\nGeorge what is what are your feelings now that it it has come out it's been reporting here at the hill that there was a exculpatory evidence based on your conversation with an FBI informant that you weren't trying to do anything wrong that you oppose any trees in our collusion that that information may not have been presented to the Pfizer court what do you think about that\nOf course it was for me it's a it's a very sad that it was I was impressed when John reporting but for me it was a sad day to see that ah that was not presented to the price of the court\nAnd that in my entire image has been characterized by this false narrative that I Am some sort of patient zero uh about a Russian conspiracy and a a Russian a Coca Cola collusion conspiracy when in fact I have absolutely no Russian\nContacts whatsoever I've never traveled to Russia I don't speak Russian I don't even have Russian American friends are in this country so um when I found myself at the epicenter of this a conspiracy as somebody who actually has no Russia contacts something just to not smell right at all to me\nGeorge Papadopoulos who remember\nWhen when it looked shaky on Carter Page who also had nothing to do with collusion or conspiracy running this stuff\nBut it looked shaky it in his own uh Papadopoulos that's how the FBI justify this investigation that that it was supposed to be Papadopoulos I'm telling you people who believe that Papadopoulos was\nPart of some of some Kremlin backed conspiracy will believe\nAnything don't believe anything\nDishes and no normal rational person could sit down and look at the facts talked to this guy and come away with thinking yeah that's right he was trying to throw a presidential election that\nEase utterly insane orderly insane there's just no\nRationale to it right all other than it it it explains for some people who work gives them an outlet for their anti Trump rage and anything that gives them an outlet for anti Trump raged they are in favor of\nSo if someone will tell them that there was a massive conspiracy to undermine the election everything and they have to believe that this total taxi I don't mean that in a mean way seems like a nice guy\nHe only got fourteen days and job we've got a felony on his record now which stinks known firearm no voting hard to get a job you know can't leave the country probably they usually have a travel restrictions and he's got and and also I I don't like that when he talks to me about this there even restrictions as part of his plea agreement about what he can say publicly\nI don't I don't like that you should be able to discuss any aspect of your case once you're once you're through the system there shouldn't be a gag order on you know once your your case as you know once you've served your punishment in your case is done but there was one on him so it's just that whole thing was just nuts and he was testifying today on Capitol Hill which is why we were\nTalking about 'em there but it's the whole thing is just totally an orderly bunkers bill um and I don't know how anybody can sink\nWhere they were a year ago and this would just\nDo quarter period or Papadopoulos ... no no\nLet's talk about making Kelly getting fired\nFolks don't get caught up in one of those Tommy corporate coffee brands okay start your day with a delicious cup of freedom it's the way to get fired up and ready to take it to all the lives in your life and by the way once they try and black rifle coffee\nThey're also going to know that they've been wrong all this time they don't need to drink that pajama boy green soy macho latte nonsense\nThey just need a delicious cup of black rifle coffee is how I started every morning\nAnd I got to tell you I distribute my black rifle K cups all over the office it's a great way to make friends and bring people into the

or die revolution black rifle coffee\nYou deserve a better way to watch for ESPN by force on today's show for\nWith the original and the entire thirty thirty\nShe went over there it didn't go very well it was in an off to the kind of start that you would have expected for somebody who was getting paid producer Mike what\nTwenty mill do we know twenty million a year I mean she's making like LeBron James money\nTo do a job that and at ten million dollar new studio they built for so she's making LeBron James money to do a job that a lot of other people could do quite honestly better than her for about a tenth of the money\nI in fact there were other people doing the job before that we're getting better ratings and we're making a fraction of her salary people water but executives at these places these are big public companies places you know NBC and NBC Universal and their own by big paramount or big a parent not paramount parent\nCompanies and uh you know they could they can determine what the salary is right that's 'cause we've\nGot shareholders public companies lots of ways to slash the money around without any Bruce or Mike oh no no no I don't make you say in sixty nine mill none of them like I Know that for now that's her severance I'm In a year in salary that's for her full they're paying out her full contract\nThat's what that sixty nine mill is I'm I'm Talking about you know the uh\nThe year to year so we should make a lot of money but if they go oh she really worth that the answer was no\nUm you know they some of these people get inside with the corporate structure at these places and they get huge huge paychecks but anyway so then Megan Megan a had a few bumps here and there I forget exactly what they were but she oh she brought up a Jane Fonda is plastic surgery\nWhich I didn't realize Jane Fonda would be so sensitive about but she was and it was kind of a weird thing to bring up in the interview on the circumstances and that was kind of a bomb for a you know for her to bring up in that way just wasn't wasn't smart and\nAnyway the latest controversy which has gotten ousted got booted from NBC which you remember she gets booted right away for those folks you know\nSpecial sex dungeon door closed by button under the desk Matt Lauer a guy was there for decades and\nWas the the the chosen one I mean the the face of that network twenty million dollars plus a year I think it was actually making more like Fifteen when he was twenty five million a year they're paying lower unbelievable sum of money for a skinny balding we who was completely replaceable by about a hundred different people but\nAndy lack in these people at NBC make decisions they liked Matt Lauer is that's all you have to do they like you you're good\nYou know it's not about the ratings it's not about the audience really what the what the exact thing in the\nIn the east sweet or the C suite the corporate suites we should be the way it's called so Megan decided\nAnd a segment on Halloween and political correctness decided to tackle the subject well that was the subject in and here's what she let's start with what she said that got her in trouble John Cleese play said clipped\n[laughter] you'll get in trouble if you are white per se but time or a black person ... white the weight like a kid that was okay as long as you were trying to find a character in the country and the real housewives of New York with ...\nAs she got is Diana Ross and she made her scandalous darker than it really is and people said that that was racist\nAnd could she wants to look like hanging around for one day I I don't know how like that that rate how hollow\nSo she didn't say anything racist what she said was that\nShe doesn't think that people necessarily dressing in costume when they dark and their skin to be in costume should be considered racist now you could agree or disagree with her\nI Would note that a lot of you probably liked the movie Tropic Thunder I think it's a very funny movie I think the best part of the movie is\nUh what's his name Morton Downey junior right at the guy please Iron Man and that his name William ... what's his name again you guys leave me out here to dry well what is the name John\nYeah Robert died Robert and I'm more Robert Downey Jr and Robert Downey do more than that yeah Robert Downey junior show so he uh you know\nHe ... he was in black face in that show I mean and that's a movie he was he was driven by protecting me black men in black face and they make fun of it during the movie and it worked and everything's pretty much it's a funny movie\nYou know there was no picketing there are no people freaking out about it at least not really and a movie did pretty well actually\nSo there are situations in which culturally black face has not been deemed to be a insulting and racist I I just named one now I also can understand why given the history of slavery and segregation in this country in the way people use to dress in black face in in in ... [noise] excuse me in mockery\nUh that that would be offensive to some people I I get that I'm not\nBut I'm just saying that she is not even really taking a definitive declared his position on all the she's just trying to have the conversation\nBut because she veered away from black race under any circumstances is racist is wrong is terrible really any darkening of the skin is part of a costume is racist and wrong and terrible NBC\nJust I mean they had different anchors coming after NBC just fed her to the wolves on this one\nAnd then that led to this which I always find so depressing and and\nThe whole thing is always so sad the Soviet style show trial forced apology I'm\nHere is what she said in an effort obviously to keep her job one that was doomed to fail before she went on the air please play her apology\nShall I Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\n[noise] when they heard the yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned that whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or a white person making errors darker can make a costume complete\nI defended the idea saying as long as it as that was respectful and part of the Halloween costume it fooled okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great parts of sitting in his chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view and as I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface blowing off always by race it in this country it is not okay for that to be part of our costume Halloween or otherwise\n\nNow I could have told or making a call me up and I have a soft spot for her because she used to be nice if you know started my career and having on her show and\nUsed to tell me that I was very talented and had a huge future and that I was amazing when I filled in for Rush Limbaugh and I was you know her favorite of all the Rush Limbaugh feelings and and you know so so I have a secret soft spot maybe not so secret anymore for Megan Kelly I'm just going to be honest about that okay I Do\nEven though I think that she turned over people and made a horrible decision by going to NBC and was ungrateful for the positions you had at Fox and all that okay fine\nI would've advised her\nBecause I understand how this game is played now because I have to deal with it from both sides and no one's paying me tens of billions of dollars\nNot even anything in the universe of that to do this kind of work that once you're in this kind of a gym\nYou can't you can't take the oh my gosh I throw myself on the mercy of the politically correct court oh my gosh please please just just let me keep my job I'm so sorry I'm so sorry because there has been a a very clear shift\nWhere now when you upset the PC police now when the social justice warriors come for you you have two choices\nFights and go down fighting\nOr in your ritualized apology humiliation and then let them take your head\nThose are the choices that's it and maybe you win the fight\nBy the way maybe you're able to defend yourself and and see it through and but I promise you if you do the oh my gosh mayor cobalt I'm so sorry I'm so terrible I should never have thought such as the number to then they just go see it's
