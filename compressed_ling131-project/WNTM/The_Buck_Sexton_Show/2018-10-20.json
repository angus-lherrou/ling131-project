staying in the fall back up in the backfield making the running back balance it out to the left side and the white jerseys were able to tackling for no game and here we have a fourth and eighth now first Gambia county was six twenty five to go in the quarter\nSeniors Jeb barber and Conrad inch absolutely destroyed their blocks on that previous playing Conrad get back\nTalk now inside of course they've got three receivers in the right\nTo receive or so left do bring one in motion quarterbacks going to drop you got to look around and we're going to\nChange the amount of the pocket ... light and it's completed the right flat\nWas he pass a lot of scrimmage will get a flag on a play all the way back to thirty three yard line but a good job there by the quarterback Jordan Patterson as he bought some time\nAnd then ended up going to completion to number twenty two I Believe that was Tyson more around the tone of your line where wrapped him up as it stands that will be enough for a first down first Gambia county but it doesn't look like it's going to\nKnow they're backing them up I don't think he was a cross the line of scrimmage I think this is probably a whole goal or\nSomething on one of the lime and yeah they have an indicator get what the penalty is\nBut our guys are saying it's against them [noise]\nSix minutes to go in the first quarter ... counties had the ball the entire first quarter this drives\nAnd they've done a good job running the football they've got a ... a few um first downs run into football that was a good play by the quarterback Patterson to extend it but they're going to call hold against\nAnd you see you see a lot of holding calls and places like that Todd ... scrambling and trying to extend plays with their feet dolphins Islam and are battling and trying to hold defensive lineman from getting to 'em for what what works out to seven eight nine seconds that they have to do that job so holding\nThe whole the whole the holding

roaming in the middle of a field [noise] quarterbacks just going to take it and punish straight up in the air\nAnd it's going to hit it to thirty it'll take a as can be a county balance and it'll come down to twenty two twenty three yard lines so that was not a play I was not expecting rose air button that either a quick tip by the quarterback and you're a mess right does a great job of holding thank you thanks to to scan be accounting penalties and the bulldogs will have a person to enter thrown twenty two yard line\nWell and exactly what we talked about in the game tired you know we don't give up the big play candy county hurts themselves with two holding calls on line and this all out there Dr and put them behind the chains but we get off the field and get the officer first series\nSkipper section of shock information for the bulldogs he'll give it to keep ... on the end around twenty cuts it up to twenty five you got to folks down across the thirty he'll run it out of bounds with the thirty seven maybe the thirty a yard line so the handoff sweep to keep showing where you're from right to layoffs and that'll be enough for a first down for the bulldogs on their first play the game\nGreat call great execution Richard Branson runs his man forty yard field on the go route clears him out we block out the inside of the defense and he shot has really goes on touch until he's run out of bounds\nThey still never touch the\nPerson now for the bulldogs with their own thirty seven yard line two receivers to the right Simon Smith\nIn the back feel will play action skipper all wrote it was right he's got he's shown wide open up to forty three he'll make the catch and cut it up for a little ... what's the forty five and take it out to the forty seven that will be closed for another first down let's see where they mark football but nobody on the show when you're out there and the ...\nOr ... those are those guys out there and went went on the deeper out in\nThe Sean stop this route on just a little to your turn around and his left by himself no one within ten yards as he catches the ball and\nFix the first down with his legs after the cat\nSend your gain on the plate is enough for her first day on the market just inside the mess right forty eight our first driver the ball game no score here with four fifty five to go in the first quarter from more Alabama to receivers why the left skipper snakes up under center\nTight end and the game to the right will give it to Simon off the left side he's going to try to top it outside he's going to get shoestring tackled and fall down right at the midfield stripes will giving to on the play it'll bring up second in a\nSpeed on speed right the average number Nineteen coming out of the game the accounting secondary just gets enough assignment type of issue you have to make them stumble at two steps later and fall\nTo Kobe James on the taco for us Gambia county came from his safety position just she just got a piece of Simon Smith on that one too she was still the right now second in April the bulldog snakes up under center\nCounterpoint action pastor wrote his right these are all kinds of room to run and he'll take it across the fifty ended the forty five we'll just go ahead and get out of bounds their skipper and he will\nAt about the forty four yard line so [noise] all kinds of room to

Marius Lewis who's six three to twenty two he's a big kid toss sweet to Simon around the left\nSide he's got a good lock on the air by Richard Branson\nIt across the forty inside the thirty five and that'll be a purse down all the way down to twenty nine yards a good job by Richard Branson and know that are you going to\nGet the blocks for the top sweets Simon Smith will pick up the first down at this can be county twenty nine with three fifty three to go in the first quarter\nNo Bernard as a great job of sealing in that line backer and given the started the whole and then Richard Branson pulses blocks at this receiver runs inside to try to make the tackled last time and to make a big play\nSo three fifty three to go in the first quarter you a mess right has at first in ten from the scan be accounting twenty nine yard line and then they take their second out of the game\nOn route that's right well and they're on their heels right now defensively Todd we were doing pretty much whatever we want in the past and game and the running game and picking up about ten yards at a time\nAs we talked about in the ... game printed this game will decide the region championship\nHumans

was a nice player game key Sean came in motion first from left or right he ends up being the lead boxer\nBlocker for Simon Smith around the right side and that'll be\nA first down they gave him all the way to defend your line it'll be first and goal for the bulldog\nSimon gets too about the Fifteen or sixteen yard on looks like he's going to go out of bounds and he sticks his right foot in the ground and cuts back inside and squirrels up another five or six yards\nTo three thirty five to go here in the first quarter you a mess right looking to put the first points on the board here on their first job at the ball game [noise] we'll send two receivers left that Britain sending would your one receiver why do the right [noise]\nToss the disarming around the left side but we've got a flag on the play I think it's can be counting was opposite no they're going to ... percent right side of our lives\nSay how [noise]\nFriendly and he's able to get into the ground\nAnd last time we were in a

here put them back then we've only had the ball twice during the ... um\nPossessions are going to be a prize tears we go into the later part this ball games can be counting was tied into the right quarterback Patterson up under center he'll give it to his running back off the right side he makes a nice\nTouch to tend to actually cross the how to cross the twenty into twenty five ... we had him

he takes it all the way out to the twenty six yard line\nThey market right to thirty three person ten to fourteen to go here in the first half [noise] Hi formation\nThey'll give it to the running back

[noise]\n\nHand off to the running back it's a thirty move out here to the thirty\nFive you'll make it make somebody miss it for thirty five to forty running back still going to sit there and we'll tracking down and you must write territory to forty two yard\nLine but a hand just to draw play again straight out the middle and the bulldogs can't get the running back down who was that run into football was that a brown again or was that\nI Believe it was brown ... number three is do a Dmitri Dmitri unborn so takes it all the way in the u._s. right territory they're gonna marking down to forty one your on your broke\nA couple of tackles ear to forty to fifty one or two to go here came clock running scared me county out of time out trips to the left\nWondering if he were to the right person ten straight dropped back\nFive Tatar says he's going to look and throws a plant route to the middle of the\nField as could be behind his receiver incomplete\nBecause there's all the cola and out of hand on that or not he's he's in great position to make the play and he might have deflected that was a quick slant to that the toll receiver out their number eleven\nSo thinking of going to go in complete bring up sucking down at ten was forty six seconds left to go here and a quarter of ... county has no time outs left\nAnd they don't take extra points so I'm assuming they won't be trying to get into field goal rain no it'll be all or nothing [noise]\nConrad is just stand in all the way back about the only yard line\nDidn't trips will go left into the boundary [noise] one receiver to the right on back in the backfield quarterbacks could a drawback is going to throw swing pass out into the flash\nGordon exactly the open field Ricky branch when we'll get brown\nMolly Brown down there back to forty for your line go to conceal jacko by Richard Branson [noise]\nAnd they can't stop the clock here looking at maybe ... maybe to maybe even just one plane left is at Thirteen\nThirteen now they marketed to forty four yard line no hurry up no huddle same formations trips to their lap quarterbacks going to drop back he's got time he's going to correct intercepted\nWas forty six yard line interceptions so there's the\nWe're hoping to get from the boat on the pets\nTo go to the right side pulled off to a great job cover that one of\nThe jets first interceptions scene\nWas going to look that was just going to look that up but I think he's had a we have on the earlier [noise]\nBy job that was overthrown and he's been out the last two possessions against these trips yep receivers he's been out a split wide almost like a man for man secondary member in\nUh your right that is his first interceptions he got a phone will recover earlier so jumps first the interception of the season you a mess right as a person ten thrown forty five yard line only twelve seconds left to go here before halftime skipper section and a shotgun formation\nWill play action Sherman to Simon Smith skipper all dropped the ball he's got time to throw it he's going to look\nDeep down the field and throw it out of bounds yet he ... he had a [noise]\nA lot of guys running around and we're going to have a a lake flag hearsay rough the past year forgot it really\nSlow to get up\nReally unfortunate see that [noise]\nProbably does have grounds to be from the get a check from the game that can be county player [noise]\nSo that's going to be a Fifteen your personal ... county [noise]\nThree seconds left to go here and a half year old that's Ruy leads fourteen to nothing [noise]\nRoughing the passer is to call the penalties now going to take the ball the way down to the U.S can be accounting forty one yard line so another chance for you almost right to try to throw in in the end zone here we'll see what we can do\nThat that play the skipper got hit on a little bit like Australian rules football at the bottom dropped it looked like he he bounce it on the ground like they have to do and [noise] down under and their rules for football and [noise]\nLuckily events right back up to him and he's able to hold onto it and throw the ball down field not a bounce\nSo you must go for a walk down the street or the rights skipper the then the backfield with Simon Smith Simon helping one protection skipper will step up so deep down the right side of the ... T shirt\nBack at the end zone and he missed it will go incomplete wow he got behind them as being white\nDoing street fighter basketball's create like a foreign Keystone out his hands when it went

[noise]\nExcuse me thanks to for for sixty five yards and then to touch down so\nWell I guess what I get credit just can't be accounting because part of their game plan was certainly the limit yeah
