issue\nWhat is she really going to do folks what what message is he going to send the Saudis on this one that would show that would so dramatically changed their minds that would\nAll of a sudden mean they would never do this again or they would think twice about doing this going what are we really going to do\nThis is not a U.S citizen this was knocked down on us soil the Saudis let's write this down to what it is the Saudis kill the guy on the soil of another country in a conflict is it disgusting and barbaric yes do the Saudis do disgusting ... all the time absolutely\nThat is nothing new\nWhy use this our problem I keep hearing about how what what what is Trump going to do what is going to do\nWhat could he do and why is it on him\nShouldn't as we don't we have a United Nations for exactly that purpose don't we have this international community that I hear so much about all the time so there can be multilateral and concerted action\nYou saw a book but they won't do anything yeah exactly they won't do anything we're all day but when they when they don't like what the US is doing it's oh why don't you wait for the international community it's it's better if it comes from from all nations United together\nOh what about this issue well no that's not wait for the United community of nations that come together let let's have the u._s.\nDo what I have\nTo say ... the the

at ... at which we are still in the war um we don't hear about it do we we don't hear about the fact that we're in the process of slowly losing that or they don't want it they they don't talk about that anymore\nOr they want to focus on this issue and I would say it's not just because\nThey do feel journalist do feel a special affinity for other journalists right that this hits home for them not so much during the Obama years when Obama was pulling the phone records of journalists and listing on the OJ charging cheats on indicted co conspirators as you know journalists\nBut you and that was Obama oh that's right you know tough guy Capra which you know a\nDamn ideas saying that that you are really the best this administration is the best messenger on that issue yeah that's a\nNew top talk

much of that you hear that about Trump all the time because he tweets\nBecause he tweets this\nUh this journalist to show the what happened to them we still don't really know\nAnd we should not lose sight of that we don't know what happened to the show we have not been told what the facts are of this case they're still trying to figure it out but everyone wants Trump to take action they they want to push the president I'd states the leader of the free world\nTo do something that could upset the balance of power in the middle East that could have long term ramifications\nAnd they don't care about any of that\nWhat they really just want is the opportunity to criticize the president for inaction and then dump all over him for whatever action he takes\nThese people are disgusting or disgrace none other than chief\nNational security propaganda is for the Obama administration Ben Rhodes takes this to the next level and you know it's once again it's always about Trump it's all

we just need the facts and will hold them accountable they're not they're not slowing down all they want to jump all over\nThat their plan they want to jump all over the president and the vice president on this issue as much as they can and they're not waiting for anything they don't wanna wait for the fact that in a way to see what action he takes they just prefer this notion that yeah\nTrump is a bad guy that helps them sleep at night one of them I I Would disagree with vice president Pence on on one matter or the notion that this is an attack on an independent press okay well he would write for the Washington Post but Saudi Arabia doesn't have an independent press at all not not even a little bit\nOkay there there is not an independent press and sort of your people say oh buckets been getting a little better than reads yeah whatever\nTurkey doesn't have an independent press in fact the country workers show was from what we see from what we believe murdered is one of the worst in the world when it comes to press freedom not Saudi Arabia turkey bad when it comes to press freedom\nSo when we say it's an attack on a free press yeah we live in a world where the free press is the exception not the rule lotta countries\nHave all kinds of constraints on what can be printed what can be said what can be shared\nLots of countries\nAnd even countries that you think of as having a free press maybe ... some of the western European states for example they have restrictions based on you know hate crime legislation and all all kinds of stuff\nIn Britain there's no oh you can ... you could print national security secrets because you're the press they had the official secrets act lock your butt up they don't care if it's a matter of public importance they'll just lock you up\nSo I just think everyone needs to take a deep breath understand that yes this is bad\nYes the u._s. should send a strong message but it's not the worst thing that's ever happened to the history of mankind we need just take a step back here and understand that people die all over the world under terrible circumstances everyday doesn't mean you ignore at all but it just means that unique perspective here\nAnd what we're going to do even if we find out that the Saudis are as culpable as is as has been alleged from the very beginning meeting all the way up at the top maybe will not sell them some munitions we ever going to sell them maybe we'll send them a a strong reprimand under\nWe have no legal authority to do anything about this we are not signatories the United states is not a signatory to the international criminal court so we can go there and\nWe're not a signatory for good reason which is that the notion of an international criminal law doesn't really exist I mean yeah there's war\nCrimes I guess but try and forcing knows unless you've already beaten the country\nAnd brought them just admission that you want to punish people and because of their war crimes that it's just it's really easy to to bang the tough guy drum on this issue it's it's a lot harder to sit back and actually come up with constructive ways to deal with all this\nYou know it's really easy to say oh you know I'm I'm all about a free press and Trump isn't doing enough or what should we do I'm not just saying oh we can't bring to show the back because we can't\nBut he's not he's not an American why does it fall\nOn us why does it fall on us just wonder you know wondering why that is\nAnd I think it's because they see they view this ultimately this is just another opportunity to

questions about just bringing a ... whoever wants to come in this country can say she ultimately here's the problem\nThat the leftist project the really the socialist or the Democrats socialist project in Western Europe and in America because there are Democrat socialist here as we know who the service and others Elizabeth Warren but she's got other problems right now\nThe problem that the Democrats socialist project has to face is that they believe in open borders but they also believe in a welfare state a massive welfare state that doesn't work\nThe Math Doesn't add up and also

them if they're down on their luck we're gonna have welfare state that should be but if if we have a policy of essentially anybody who shows up and has a ... a sob story about how their country has not I'm not talking to people that just generally that are facing any imminent violence they just say oh\nThe jobs here are better\nWell guess what if I show up in Switzerland and say hey that I I like this place better it's cleaner it's more civilized I demand citizenship they're going to put my button on a plane and kick me out of the country never let me back and it was going to feel sorry for me\nThere is an order that country's try to maintain\nOther countries are allowed to have borders not only that other countries are not expected to take in millions and millions and tens of millions\nOf people from a different culture who speak a different language and who once they come to this country increasingly claimed that this country is not fair to them because we don't do enough for them\n\nWas under the impression that if you came to America you're supposed to feel grateful and legal immigrants by the way all of you listening Hi five thank you welcome to be part of the American family legal immigrants overwhelmingly do but I Do see a trend among illegal immigrants where do they think that\nWe owe them something\nWe owe them not just citizenship not just permanent residency but also\nAll the goodies that the state can offer free health care free school free housing free everything\nEven America with are incredible economy and our economic dynamism and thank you

her Trump second year in office\nGDP over four percent\nSingle best measure we have of economic activity in what's going on in this country songs that go beyond the corn and we're slowly please yes there was a natural economic reset that occurred Obama made a slower and more painful and less powerful than it would have been had he not gotten in the way but he was\nIgnorance of economics I mean Obama is just not somebody who understands business not somebody who ever had to look at a balance sheet print in like the time not somebody who had to run a business of any time you know he was in the business of Obama different [noise] but\nThe facts facts cannot be allowed to get in a way of the left is there with all this stuff\nThis group is going to come to the border and they are going to be in a position\nWhere we can either let them in or not and you know what the liberals are going to say let them\nIn\nAnd we're going to turn around and say hold on a second but if if their claims of asylum allow them entry in this country what we're really saying is that anyone can come and stay as long as they want anyone is allowed to show up in this country and we are effectively have an open border\nBecause all that all of us required for someone who's to say the right things now the word is out now we know what the loopholes All right now the people in these communities that are coming into this country no that all they say is I fear violence in my home country\nI fear violence I mean violence can happen at any one country is number one I saw it was supposed to be for people that are fleeing either a horrific natural disaster and by the way they're supposed to go back usually we give them temporary status for natural disasters\nOr because we're ... we're carrying country but we're not supposed to be Trump's not supposed to just be you know the the the fat cow to be milked by the rest of the world and that's what's happening the Democrats have no way of turning his back by the way\nThey understand or they understand that quite honestly\nThere is\nNo way that they can explain to the American people what it is that they really want if they told the truth to Americans would ever\nWould have a lot of folks would say oh what a second I don't think that's going to work I don't think you can just bring in endless amounts are foreigners\nNot through the legal process not go through the normal channels of assimilation that had been in this country for centuries now a joined this community that now liberals speak to specifically be illegal immigrants in this country the quote on documented joined the ranks of the aggrieved undocumented\nAnd try to get them access to the public treasury as fast as possible\nWe are Twenty one trillion dollars in debt I'll talk to you more about that later on the show bringing people without a high school level education and without English language skills by the millions is not actually making our economy stronger that is why\nIt's an obvious lie if if Americans are not\nBalancing the budget at the end of the year for the American people are actually paying as they go when it comes to government spending we really think that bringing a lot of foreigners who don't have skills who aren't going to remember I'm Talking about illegal foreigners\nThey're going to be the ones that set the economy right I don't think so I Know you know there's two but man is frustrating\nIt is frustrating that you're going to hear so much is going to turn into one big media sob story to oh who would turn these people who would

the way the media describes him trust me that judges are leftist\nSo you might get somebody like America Garland to come through it uh but overall though well bring it to a screeching halt so so at

you realize that\nWe will be subjected to ... a stoppage of Trump's\nMost important policy agenda items if the Democrats take the house it will be over you know maybe they'll play a little political

leadership bad later\nSo I I like everything when Lindsey Graham who say they're still the very end I don't uh I like he he was he didn't read it the way that it's out it I could say that I I he just misspoke a you know he didn't mean that you\nJust men or Iran is a bad country Iran is not bad people in fact the Iranians up and many Iranian friends throughout my life and ah it would be a great day to have the Iranian people in Iran able to have the same some of the same freedoms of the a wonderful Iranians that live in this country uh we've had a whole ... running chair anyway\nI Love the other stuff you were saying about I was going to take a DNA test\nEvery Lindsey Graham is ... he's very much a very much a man\nStruck by a kind of knew swagger 'cause I I think that he really understands uh he he really understands that\nYou got to be willing to fight the other side you got to be willing to go to the mad I mean Lindsey in a sense kind of mirrors my own feelings last few weeks where I've just said last few months\nYou know what as much as\nAs much as I always want to leave the door open for the other side and I want I Want people on the left to listen to this show I Want\nYou know honest good Democrats to listen to the show as much as they're willing to uh in terms of the of the ideas we can't just oppose them we we've got to crush the ideas I don't crush people but I Want to crush ideas\nAnd that means sometimes yes as the kids say we might have to own the lives a little bit\nOf solidity grandma I liked that he's been oh is that a little more swagger is I've been saying and I also\nThink that you know on on immigration he has some interesting things to say I I I got to get him\nI got to get them a little more hard line on this stuff folksy here's what he said liquidate\nTheir eleven million illegal immigrants here that came from burning for countries [laughter]\nWhat do we do with them I Want to ... based immigration system you got to get Democrats and Republicans working together ... control who gets the job for\nLegal immigration moved to ... base immigration you can ignore the eleven man they'll never be a deal right with the Democratic party that does make a deal with the eleven may in her non felons who've been here for twenty and Thirty years once you get them in a good spot even have a new immigration system\nYou know I I don't think you get it on this one yet folks I think that Lindsey\nHe's a little ... on the issue as I've been saying thank you Yale University math nerds for back me up on this it's not eleven million age twenty million it's twenty two zero at least\nI I don't know what we have to do to get people to understand this is nine eleven it is twenty million at a minimum\nWhich is a vast number of people from a a generally speaking from one country\nFrom Mexico I mean the vast majority of them are from Mexico\nWhich also happens to be a neighbor of ours geographically where there was an enormous border and you know it it poses its own issues for political unity in this country and really does I Know people are not allowed to national security analyst will tell you\nThat when you have a population that has\nA that has moved across the border that has fought wars over that Porter we don't often think about that but we fought a war with Mexico over the border\nAnd then you have a population that maintains a tremendous and ... and tremendously powerful and continuing tied to the the what's considered the homeland of the mother country a ... you have a recipe for stabilization you really do I mean politically at a minimum destabilization\nAnd that's you know that's something that I think is a you know meet needs to be remembered here I I think Lindsey Graham is might look I give you a lot of credit for the whole capital thing but as much as I'd like to just look at that and say it's all fine now they're gonna get fooled and immigration again they're talking about doing this\nDeal and the deal is going to be amnesty and then we'll see what happens for your security well see what happens with this request for a wall and that's not good enough that's not acceptable to eat and Lindsey talked a little bit more about this deal that he thinks is going to happen play seven\nHouses have been and a half for the wall I mean give me five and the Senate has been a path\nWill close the gap a duck I remember that six hundred and Ninety thousand kids brought here on the average age of six no place else to go Trump's going to win in court he can repeal dock of the day he wins in court what do we do with these young people so I'd like to do a deal for wall funding for ...\nFor wall funding for DACA that ...\nThat I I think I think you could sell that to the republic GOP ... if it was full well fun you get that five billion and it's just deferred action still aren't it's not a a but it you know it can't be it can be citizenship and it can't be\nIt's just okay well we're going to have a we're going to see how this goes it because you can't discuss what you're going to do with the nine eleven but twenty million illegals in this country and Jill you have a reasonable assurance that you're not going to be dealing with another twenty million in ten years\nAnd if you by the way I understand that the political sway that\nThe Latino Democrat community in this country will have for even more a unrestricted immigration particularly from your from South of the border that will\nDo the entire debate and discussion going forward and all Democrats will see is that they will be importing masses of new voters\nWho will essentially make the Republican Party a you know a an afterthought they will they will be able to turn America into a one party\nState that's the game the Democrats are flying the Republicans keep thinking about this like well you know maybe we can deal with the Democrats are looking at the immigration issue is how do we make the Republican Party

Bahgat check it out\nOf a better way to watch the sports book ESPN wants to live for and all of that show from\nLaughable argument I mean the notion that Elizabeth Warren is a Cherokee or could consider herself a Native American is is laughable to any serious human bit laughable I mean you should laugh about it\nAt the wall Street Journal said if she is a person of color than words have no meaning she is as far from a person of color as anyone could possibly be\nAnd yet she still kind of ... she is she still clings to it but then there was just wondering well did she receive any benefit my friends there is so much circumstantial evidence that she received a benefit that it is also laughable\nTo suggest that that she did not um that she did not have the ... and I'm not\nSomebody who's a school snob but she did not have the academic pedigree for law school do then going to be a professor at the University of Pennsylvania an Ivy League school and Harvard considered to be the number one school and and really the number one law school in the United states no way that happens\nIn last the hiring committees think that they can while they can but it's very important them when they put out these reports very important that they have a Native American on the faculty that's a big big deal for them they have their pick they can have anyone they want\nAnd that's why I also\nWhy would Elizabeth Warren list herself as such\nIt must have gave her some benefit it's a bizarre thing to do unless you are gaming the system the only reason you would do that if you were Elizabeth Warren and clearly not a person of color would be to game the system so it just defies belief completely ridiculous I can\nTell you that I spoke to 'cause I have access to a lot of Democrats up the hill or and I spoke to Democrats today who our colleagues and I got to say there were all there were all say it to\nThis is just there's no excuse there's nothing you can say about it that she thought that this proved her case was completely insane a Donald Trump also\nWe had one more weight on the sea rewrote thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred

[laughter] [laughter] sometimes referred to as ... as\nHe has defeated really the progressive front runner for twenty twenty before she was even able to get into the race officially\nAnd he defeated by getting inside her head and forcing her to make one of the great unforeseen political errors of all time I have never seen anything quite like this uh this ... this is truly truly astonishing\nUh but then the president had this thing today later on that I got to say I don't know what's going on here I I Want the president focused on what matters and I want the president on policy among fighting back absolutely\nBut what does this thing about what is this thing about a ... horse Oh yes here's what he wrote federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled to a legal fees\nGreat now I can go after a horse race and her third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed a letter she signed\nShe knows nothing about me a total calm you know it's interesting Trump really hold out here that that this is a lie start to finish\nAnd I have thought that ah that that there's no way that she's lying about Trump just because of the detail and ... they look they do know each other they have had contact it's not like the\nKavanaugh allegation and want it's nothing there's nothing criminal about anything that's even alleged about Trump with Stormy Daniels or why should say but his contact with her people are saying it was all the campaign finance that's pathetic than no no shot no chance\nUm but I got to say now I'm thinking you know\nIs it ... why why do people jump to the conclusion that Trump actually had they had this affair with her\nUm what what I said I shouldn't say jumping to conclusions I think that's obvious but ... why are we so sure a lot of people into seem very brochure about it I I'm I'm just ... I'm keeping an open mind there's ... there's never been any proof offered that I'm aware of\nMeaning she's never been able to show text messages or emails running at you know that that that relates to the affair she just gave this description of him and you know there's another part of this and I'm just thinking through this\nHer whole description of Trump in her book it's like she wrote description based on what she knew the media would want her to say which was just be really a ... and degrading and nasty toward toward the president [noise] so\nI'm you know I I had thought that the president this was before he was the president I have thought that maybe he\nHad strayed from his ... year and I was willing to say look\nI care about what he's doing as president and the political movement he represents I'm not I'm not sitting around trying to judge all politicians by every every action in their lives um bad especially because it's you know the only do that the only enforce that against Republicans they want enforce it against Democrat but there's also part of me the things well you know\nMaybe there's something else here it it just I I'm thinking about right I'm thinking about it I'm not totally sold one way or the other but now they they they're all focused on the present referring to a woman as a horse race\nYou know I this is why I say Trump was winning and winning and winning this week and this feels a little bit like a field a little bit like an unnecessary distraction and and not something that I Would really want the president to say but that said\nMaybe when you're when you're this when you're this ... when you're in his position and you're fighting against everybody and and it's all an uphill battle or maybe they're just going to be these you know is it's not they're not all going to be a hits right they're not all going to be great\nSo that that's part of a Jew and maybe he's human which we all know he is maybe he's imperfect which we all know he is a and I think that we should be able to have that chalk are among those of us who really support the president and his agenda which I clearly do\nStill be want to say okay I kinda wish you hadn't called some woman horse race on Twitter I just I think that that's yeah that's a little\nThat's a little bit beneath where where our presence droopy that said he's been crushing everything else all week and been amazing so you know so he's not perfect he's pretty darned good though so you know I'll give it to him on that and that's I I think that's an okay standard to have for politicians you know it's not perfect we've pretty darn good\nIt really is um and I I've seen recently some some conservatives that things started to come around to this notion of why do we have to why don't we have to pretend like any politicians perfect\nAnd we haven't taken action and I worry that we're not going to take action I worry that this is soon going to become one of these issues where are we\nAll talk of big game we all talked talked tough on this but at the end of the day nobody wants to be the one that says that we got to spend less Republicans will talk about\nOkay we can't tax more fine but the truth is we've got to spend less and that means we got to spend less on Social Security and Medicaid or Medicare Medicaid\nThat's what it means that is what it means or else it it has no meaning and Republicans don't want to hear that and I know a lot of the folks listening to this than I have a tough time with that they feel they paid in and so it's not an entitlement at\nThe government you know making amends for taking money from them for all those years Social Security that's pretty much true we just use a change the structure of a long term Medicare it's not true with Medicare your kids if you're listening to this really actually your grandkids if your Medicare age\nThey're the ones in your great grandkids are going to be paying the financial price\nFor the care that people are taken out of the system today\nIt's not right it's intergenerational theft and I know people don't want to hear it but that's just the truth\nMeanwhile the feds collected record income taxes in twenty Eighteen so yeah we're always told oh there's not enough there's not enough ah\nIt'll revenues there's not a rubber notes there's too much ... more than a rabbit or there's too much spending\nGovernment has got to rein it in and in less where you know we're\nEither going to have a serious national conversation about this and take action we're going to suffer some really horrific economic consequences and by the time the consequences are obvious it's going to be tough to turn it around and that's just the truth [noise] so I uh I'm a look we'll continue to talk about this issue because it matters but\nI I won't harp on it too much fucked or Ron Paul did it for a little bit that was interesting he served as a big believer miss [noise]\nAnd
