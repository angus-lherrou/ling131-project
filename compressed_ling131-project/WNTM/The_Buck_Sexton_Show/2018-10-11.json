behavior no it's not my right people who are on it and they're angry about the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy of the\nWay they feel that way before you jump in okay\nHe's just supposed to sit there you see and get pummeled he's a he's a never Trump conservative or never Trump Republican or whatever and his\nJob he the guy I Know because they they wanted me to play the role and I wouldn't blame his job is just sit there and just get smacked around by I think there were four lives on that CNN panel\nIncluding the host for lives\nWon't do it as a ... lab ballads they bad well he's totally correct I mean I I give him credit for at least we want to say it on CNN but they act like it's ... now it's a question of the number one it may not be ... ... what do you mean it's a mob\nWhen you've got a big best when you've got more than three people who are together screaming in your face and acting like maniacs because you're trying to have dinner with your wife 'cause they don't like her politics don't like your political party that's getting into my behavior when you get twenty or thirty or forty people that are doing it which is what we've seen in these restaurants at a minimum\nThat it's definitely my behavior but that that is the word used to describe it but you see there are very sensitive\nAbout using that were there very sensitive about saying it because they know that their audience is all a bunch of lives and they don't want the lives that feel like anyone standing and mean about the really devoted lips\nYou know there there's a sympathy just because people don't go out and you know where all the black stuff and act like anti ... doesn't mean that they despise anti fun fact I think there are way more Democrats and you're seeing this now\nWho\nDon't necessarily agree with that he was methods but they agree with\nThe message and they know that the audience the CNN audience does not want to be told hey ah there are there's a problem on the left here and people are acting like maniacs mob maniacs no less\nThat's not what the audience wants to hear so they stay away from it it reminds me so very much of what was being or what was happening back in the days of black lives matter you guys don't I'm Talking about um black lives matter days there were all these incidents\nThe most probably well actually the one in Baltimore was really well known and then there was one in in St Louis Missouri they're these incidents where you\nHad a mob that followed onto a protest of some kind and they were burning down buildings they were looting stores they were throwing rocks at cops and CNN would go from there showing burning building one moment to political analyst later on\nDay one well is mostly peaceful protest it was a mostly peaceful protest while I'm mostly peaceful protest or what is it even made\nIt can you imagine if if you just did a very simple thought experiment if you looked at a Tea Party rally circuit twenty ten\nAnd there was anybody throwing rocks at cops there was anybody who was letting buildings on fire they were like oh my gosh look the country has been in turmoil look at the rioters\nAnd yet when you flip it around and you have people that are saying they're part of this black lives matter movement then all of a sudden\nYou know they're they're not ... you can't afford them as writers you certainly wouldn't refer to what was going on even though it was about race and racial animation claims of racism and never allowed to call it a race riot on TV\nBut that is what it would have been called decades before and if you were to look at what was happening yes a lot of times riots or follow on to demonstrations usually people have to get together first before they can be a big mob that's destroying things you could always have this\nA I got to say I I don't know\nHow it is that that segment on CNN is considered up to ... in any way up to that network standards that that's acceptable I how how that how that is allowed to happen\nOn a cable news show when when keep in mind there's a guy who I interviewed a what was it maybe a few weeks ago who is a sports\nCaster and he said something about about boobs on he said that he you know I forget what it was exactly but he made some reference to the female organ that is called by some uh boobs and it was a\nBig like oh my gosh you can't say that I don't see a few minutes or this winter's\nOver and it was a big problem but then you add what just happened there where there's obviously very racially\nInflammatory language being used in and people laughing and and mocking\nTanya west to look I Know that he's a provocateur tour and people have all these very strong opinions on it but I I think that there was a line crossed there and I'm I don't understand how anyone doesn't feel like there was a La Crosse there\nBut you also get a bit of a window into how the left at this moment in time but there are grasping for reasons are grasping for for ways to justify\nA their intolerance of other ideas the the rabid way which they approach trying to destroy their enemies you know we we have so few celebrities\nOn the right that ... or ... or write period and we have so few people that come out and and espouse conservative principles that with someone of ... a level in celebrity land says anything about being pro Trump H there's this mob yes there's that word again this mob mentality to tear him down immediately\nIt's one thing if they want to say who cares\nBut think about what a disparity there is in this realm you up every idiot celebrity I Know we talk about you know I'm not saying she's an idiot but we're talking I don't know we're talking about Taylor Swift and uh you know her effort to help the Democrats in Tennessee in all these different celebrities out there you know George Clooney I mean name what\nTim Robbins and Susan surrender these these people were all just\nAbsolute hardcore left these Alec Baldwin and it was a really good actor I Wish he wasn't such a common in all of them are on this one side and then you add it all the music artist you know this is always the big joke with whenever there's inauguration parties like the Obama inauguration parties where the the top recording artist in the world\nAnd the Trump recording artists were I don't know who's that guy told me he wasn't he one of them will put a boot in your is that a ... that's a different song actually the different artist I don't\nAh I also I like I think it's Clint Black Iraq them up and I roll I don't know there's some great some great country at them so that I still remember up there I should listen to more country music that's that's one thing that's\nThat is that's come out of this conversation that I Can't think of any like if someone is your favorite country artist John I'd I'd have to go with I don't know Garth Brooks just because he's the only one I can think of off the top of my head no no she economy is Garth Brooks with no come on anyway\nUh well we don't have any of these artists and Tanya is out there and he said people are what are you talking about like yeah look I Am Baldwin Nick Searcy a James Woods his Twitter account is awesome I mean there's there's some conservatives out there for sure but we have one high level music act like this\nAnd really more of a cult look he's more of a cultural icon not that I'm some big ... fan or is it ... or ...\nJohn that we call in with the shorthand it must be a when it's just why eat right yeah that's right I work I mean technically I work for her media so I feel like I Need to know more about\nMusic industry lingo\nShow but but they're they're piling on him and why was because they resent\nAny loss of their ability to have a total echo chamber on the left when it comes to or echo chamber fucking love when it comes to any cultural or music\nHollywood figure ... they they cannot abided they cannot deal with it and I can't deal with 'em like they cannot psychologically prompts us it it concerns them it worries them they don't they don't know what they would do\nThey don't know how they would handle it if they didn't have all the celebrities that they know what I'm saying oh you're so great and climate change is terrible and\nOh all this stuff really really do need to get it need to get a grip and uh that's\nThat's my that's one of my main takeaways from all this but let's\nJust note that the\nIRS or for a moment we have a some others and so the hurricane Mike is made landfall right do we hold on to the IRS where we've got on this so far\nThe biggest concern is if everybody that are the people they just chose not to evacuate I I spent time the last few days going up and down the coast getting people to evacuate but this is a horrible\nHorrible storm a hundred and fifty plus miles an hour\nA disease twelve inches of rain but the thing that people I think don't realize is the storm surge whether it's six feet or fourteen feet it's all deadly and I'm very concerned that people are not taking that into consideration so\nWe are ready to respond to we had help anybody now that chose not to evacuate ah they have to hunker down and take care of themselves a we have nice ten thousand people that are\nAlready free physicians that gets a power back on but I Am scared of that the people that chose not to go back in fact the way this is they just say her when a storm and\nThat's the Governor Scott in Florida numbers or Mike first of all obviously thoughts and prayers everybody is affected I Know we've got a lot of great listener as a lot of folks down in Florida and we just hope everybody\nEveryone down in in the state is is going to be All right through this whole thing it feels like this storm was kind of a kind of snuck up on people right because the the hurricane before this there was a lot of oh this is going to be\nA huge and we we I remember seeing it way out in the Atlantic I'm like that you know that the Canary Islands like what's going on over there and and then this one though got really big really fast one was already close to ... am I Am I mistaken him that notion\nYeah no this one came out of nowhere and usually don't get many hurricanes up the Gulf Coast right I mean it's coming up to a point where it's they're not used to seeing it like Clearwater Beach Naples like that area I haven't seen\nIt usually it's usually from the Olympics yeah right in the ... the east coast of the four oh well\nI Hope everyone is All right I I'm ... I'm hearing that there's been a lot of lot of people decided not to evacuate and\nYou know we we just like I said doesn't preserve it what what are more coming up here in ... seconds on the continued fought from Kavanaugh\nLeft is still just [noise]\nLiving in this fantasy land of of they're going to raise this whole Kavanaugh situation they're going to find a way to to make it like it never happened and I just got to tell you I find that a distressing [noise]\nUm but I have a solution for everybody I have a way I think the shutdown that tall [noise]\nNot just going to city or complain about them complaining about cabinet I'm gonna tell you how we can get them to shut up about Cavanaugh\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home titled fraud where the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere is called home title fraud\nAnd it's simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy in home title lock found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had it been real\nThis thief would have taken out loans using books home is equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments were ... showed up in that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraught look if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home title lock for pennies a day\nHome title luck puts a virtual barrier around your host title the instant they detect sinister activity their own and helping to shut it down they don't titled me already be compromise you don't know sign up and get a free titles scan and report\nAs a hundred dollar value free at whole title luck dot com home title locked dot com\nThree mobile\nStation and the Florida Panhandle ... Fox News fast moving hurricane Michael now over in Georgia or several tornadoes were reported but not before uprooting trees down and power lines and causing flooding in the Florida Panhandle at least one person was killed\nA different attorney general a different department of justice looking at what let's see how that goes there is nothing that stopped the D. O. J. from doing that there's nothing to stop them from doing it\nBut now you started to get into the weak points in our whole system the weak point being that if you have people who are operating entirely in bad faith there really aren't any limits on it really ... there aren't any limits\nOn an investigation you do have a right to a speedy trial and hopefully a judge would enforce that although these days who knows but you do not have the rights we should be the investigation in fact in an investigation can\nOn at ... at for for years on end bankrupt you some people I Know there's some people have actually taking deals meaning they've they pleaded guilty to something just to make the investigative just to make the investigation and the process and the the trial making all stop because they they're already\nThe process is the punishment so the same way that also an Obama did this rather speaking about treading constitutional norms Obama decided that using prosecutorial discretion he would effectively abrogate immigration law\nAnd say that if you're here legally you're not going to that you will not be deported we will create an extra legal process for you wonder you know the following conditions and he did that all under what is effectively prosecutorial discretion\nThere are lots of ways that the system can be abused if they are going to abuse of I used to be of the mind more of a I guess it's a traditionalist William F Buckley style can serve I used to be the mind up you know we have to we have to maintain the principles that he that they show quickly abandon\nBut from what I see happening in our politics today I take a position of you know we we've got actually beat them we've got to win otherwise we just suffer and and hope that there'll be better times when there's plenty of reasonably but actually things will just keep getting worse\nAnd that's why yes there is there is a part of me that especially in the aftermath of the capital and on any issue related to Kavanaugh says you've got to fight fire with fire and in this case that means if they want to do this thing with Hillary we're going to have the da da da da de la ... combing\nWho was fired let's remember that was fired from the FBI and is also I Believe under investigation for possible leaking classified material\nLet's let's take a look at ah at what the FBI determination would be or rather the deal Jay ... actually makes a decision not the FBI but whether to bring charges\nLet's see what the deal Jay determination is but it was you know this time around\nAll ... no we we shouldn't drag the country back into the they wanted the Democrats are openly advocating for dragging the country back into that mash\nOh that must be the FBI by the way\nYou know Rand Paul is that a tough year year and a half\nRand Paul was holding the FBI feet to the fire a little bit on something that used to get a lot of attention including in conservative circles and that is all this warrantless spying\nYou think that given all the Russia collusion insanity this will be a bigger topic here's what here's what Rand Paul to say\nWhile the FBI by and large is full of good people yourself included you have had some bad apples you had Peter Struck and his girlfriend talking about trying to bring the president town you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is that as Madison said men are not angels that's what we have the constitution that's where we ask you to get a warrant\nThe information you gather in the foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no\nConstitutional manner to that matter to that data and yet you once and then use it on domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years and years you should not be allowed to access that data without a warrant\nI agree and I have to say it's a little concerning that given that now on the right we are very aware of the fact that the FBI deal Jay and the intelligence community or in part weaponized against Trump\nThat there has not been any real change in how these prophecies work or certainly there's been no legislation to prevent this from happening again\nYou don't remember this all happened after we already had the IRS targeting of Tea Party it is this all happened after we should have been aware\nThat or political opponents in in our own country we're willing to abuse the apparatus of government reporters and purposes and there's been no real change there's been you know instead of Democrats pretending like none of us really happened\nThey thought they were going to prove Trump Russia collusion all they're

on an op ed\nFrom ... op ed confirms that this is the Washington Post the central issue of twenty Eighteen is health care I've seen polling suggests this is the case that people are likely to cast votes based upon their perception of health care what is really going on here what is the state of health care right now as it\nTo the midterms interest in general what's going on because somebody who can answer this question forest overthrow is with us now is the president for the foundation for research on equal opportunities also a Forbes editor over great to have you\nSay buck\nSo a ... well first of all is this is this concept what'd you say it's accurate I mean are are we are we seeing data to suggest that people as much as we all get told by the media it's all about Trump's tweets and Russia collusion and Kavanaugh that it actually might be health care the tips the balance of the of the house in the Senate to one or the other side of the ...\nWell I I haven't seen any polling data fucking I've looked at it pretty closely at this particular question I haven't seen any polling data\nTo suggest that health care right now his motives motivating people to turn out ah for November of having a obviously is a much bigger driver but I Will say that if Democrats are successful in retaking the house or whether or not to take the Senate they just take the house\nUm and even if they don't somehow what ever happened the midterms are gonna be over you know this book to your listeners know this was seen as the midterms over literally within hours limit turns being over what are we going to start talking about\nThe twenty twenty presidential election in particular in this case the Democratic primary for who's going to challenge Trump and what that primary is going to be all about but it's all going to be about\nWho is going to outbid who who's going to be the true blue purists on single payer Democrats in the primary for president are going to fight over this issue and what Trump is doing in this op ed is he's firing his initial salvo for his reelection campaign\nSo ... where is the healthcare debate right now for between Republicans and Democrats as it stands today I mean you're you're mentioning where you're talking about where the left will go after this election where is the last positioning itself but where Democrats position themselves right now and and what is the Republican pitch on healthcare\nHere one of the things buck that's been fairly interesting and you may have talked about this on your program in the past is that democratic ads about health care and the midterms are actually they're spending more money on health care as the Republicans are\nThey're talking a lot about this Texas lawsuit\nWhich aims to overturn Obamacare the out by attacking with a preexisting conditions provision vomit care and so what you have a lot of democratic congressmen and candidates saying is that Republican I'm running against he's against protecting you from a high insurance payments because a pre existing conditions\nOn for protecting you from that well for me so there is a lot of these races a lot of talk about preexisting conditions and when I'm On Capitol Hill I hear that all the time members asking me like you know what should we do about pre existing conditions\nSo that that is that's the thing you're hearing a lot of it you're not hearing so much about single payer the single payer thing is really about twenty twenty\nSingle payer you think is now going to or I should say is going to be the Democratic party official ... an official position on healthcare once we're heading into twenty twenty you're you're confident of that\nI'm certain of it's just like repeal and replace for the Republicans right like what Republicans wanted to be against repealing Obamacare running in elections in the last ten years right similarly progressive to dominate the left wing primaries on Democratic Party if you don't say you're for single payer\nYou're not going to win at all you're going to have a primary challenge to every Democrat fields that pressure from the left and frankly most of them genuinely philosophically want single payer even though they believe most most intelligent Democrats believe it's unrealistic and could never happen\nThey do philosophically would they would prefer to government takeover of health care system so yeah they're not gonna they're not going to deny that therefore\nSingle air they're going to say yeah I'm for single or they're all going to climb over each other to talk about how pro single payer there\nHow how accurate worthy early GOP projections that oh you you know over you've been involved in this discussion stretching back for a long time\nBut how accurate were the projections of how damaging and bad Obamacare would be you know I remember this was like the fiercest political discussion of the country back in the early days the Obama administration\nDog whistles folks dog whistles another way of saying I'm going to call Republicans racist or something that's not racist but I can pretend it is if I say it's a dog whistle that's the Reverend Al Sharpton who some will remember from when he was pedaling the yes the rape hoax\nPerpetrated by Warner Brawley who went on to lose\nIn court a defamation case settled this she than a centrally refused to pay and it has since\nMoved into obscurity Africa they did some update on to want to Brawley a few years ago and found that\nShe was living somewhere and just trying to avoid having to pay anything on the defamation settlement that she uh she lost so you can imagine when you hear today from people\nSaying oh are you blaming the victim well the court blamed the so called victim they're these so called survivor 'cause she wasn't a victim are survivors we found out\nBut let's say focus for a moment on they stop and frisk point as Trump brought this up he gave a speech what was the road and we mentioned stop and frisk for Chicago and here's what they say about this\nThey claim that New York the most visible single place to have instituted a stop and frisk policy and it was done under Mayor Bloomberg was we know from today Democrat Bloomberg\nWas Democrat he was an independent member member when he says yeah those those are those speeches about the snow\nAnd then and then they would they had the interpreter and and and but Bloomberg would go into a little like he'd be like ... Mayor Bloomberg God Bless bad and you all you do as little Bloomberg\nEspanol ... I I that was great that was great those are simpler ties producer Mike Mayor Bloomberg would slip into his hundred words of Spanish that he spoke in order to just let it let New Yorkers know that uh you know the snow is\nCold and they will move it we we wrap you know that was only seen the Blasio common\nI Know we we didn't know what we had\nYou see the Blasio are read by the way he says the mayor of New York city in case anybody a needs to be told that\nA major city hit somebody corrupt bill was talking about housing for homeless he's like I'm Sorry I'm In the middle of my work out it's like oh you mean that work out that you do at the gym that requires a fleet of SUVs and take you an hour from the mayor's mansion\nIt cause you liked that Jim in Brooklyn but this guy doesn't do anything all day it's an hour to get there an hour to get back he works out I guess per hour we know that he spends all of his time on the elliptical let's be real\nLot of stretching it a lot of electrical and you know ... when somebody comes up to them in the gym is a public official he gets all Snoopy about it he's a he's a snip east is that the man anyway um I just I'm just saying Bloomberg maybe running as a as a Democrat or he was the one or he's gonna run as a\nDemocrat at least that's what people are saying as of today run for the twenty twenty race\nHe had stop and frisk what a stop and frisk alright it allows people to allow law enforcement to on a reasonable suspicion stop and talk to you and then if they think it is necessary for safety they can pat you down now they say that this is inherently\nRacist and the reason for that is that you have a large number of these stop and frisk hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands of these stops that occurred over a period of many years in New York they say oh well you had a disproportionate number of\nA black and Hispanic males who were stopped and either talk to or poor padded down looking for weapons and some people say it's racist\nInteresting when you actually crunch the numbers on that you find out that as a as it relates to the proportion in New York City of crimes committed by people who fall into the demographic of black or Hispanic males they were actually stopped flash\nWhen you control for the number of crimes committed by people in different categories less than their share overall but still people say it's bad optics and they say that you know it looks bad and the and then they they point to the fact that New York is in a crowd it continued downward trajectory on crime part is that\nReality for America's biggest city has been ongoing for a long time you know this is like showing up in in the in\nThe final stages of something and saying well this is this happened because I showed up but it's like it was already happening the crime was already happening\nThe only point I think that's very fair to make on this is that conservative along did say if you get to stop and frisk there'll be a big spike in crime and we haven't seen that in New York City okay so that's a little bit of the background on stopping for Trump is saying let's just stop and frisk in Chicago\nAnd the ACLU types and all and they freak out of a stop and frisk but here's the thing about doing stop and frisk in Chicago\nNobody has any ideas for how to make Chicago a less crime ridden place I mean the the number of shootings people think of ...\nAnd I look that obviously is going to get the most headlines because when you have a weekend in Chicago with twelve people killed\nOr you know more than that it's when we get whatever it is I mean they've had these these weekends with forty fifty people shot you look at the numbers shot it in the low it's an elope thousands in Chicago all and people getting shot or stabbing a given year that's a lot of people\nThat are getting shot no one has any solutions or any ideas for this all I hear\nFrom lips and I get to talk to them when they come on on the hill\nTV show oh you're from lives is we need to invest more in schools I'm like yeah 'cause that's why the gang bangers selling drugs it it's it's because there's not enough investment a local public school would come on this isn't serious but they they have no idea is no solutions for whatsoever and what you find is that\nYou know they don't want to talk about real structural change like why do we\nAll the studies show that the the biggest single terminal whether a neighborhood if you know how many single parents are are in a neighborhood statistically speaking you have a very good sense of what the crime rate will be and that when you control for intact household meaning you know a a mother and father both in the household\nThe crime rate is essentially the same across\nAll ah all all cultures and all ethnic backgrounds\nSo you can't have the structural conversation about why this balance the place or Chicago or you can't talk about more aggressive policing issue that's racist and at the end of the day this is where you see one of these liberal policies that they think they're being do gooder is near protecting the civil rights of minorities but you're just going to have having more people\nGetting shot and they have no answers to it and that that Sharpton he's running around and demagogue ing well as\nSharp as what it does struggling runs around and and demagogues on things but that that he's willing to do it on this issue with so little pushback from anyone in the media just goes to show you that some of these old paradigms just ... just don't go away\nYou know liberals would prefer to call Republicans\nRacist and as sharp and to just say their dog whistling then to seriously consider proposals that would save lives and this was that there was a breaking point in New York you know Giuliani came in you know a numbers ...\nNumbers based policing a ... that\nAll that was done and the liberals were howling and shrieking over that too but then they realized oh you mean the city is going to be a lot safer I Hope the same thing can happen for Chicago\nI Hope they managed to get this violence situation on the control of a\nMutt all my

is back\nA little while ago I wrote a story\nAbout how woman tried to bring an emotional support peacock on\nAn airplane with her and I thought you know as crazy as that is at least give her points for creativity because you yeah you can obviously bring your emotional support elephant on the plane too big not off like a lot of leg room but could you bring a peacock theoretically on a plane with you yes you could\nNow people are starting to crack down on this and and I got to say that there is a I've got mixed emotions about it there was a woman who tried to get on a flight from frontier airlines in Orlando, Florida a just a few days ago\nAnd she held this flight up for two hours you know why John she wanted to bring on her emotional support squirrel\nAnd sure enough they had a problem with that because there is a policy that frontier airlines does not allow rodents\nAboard flight so they they are and she wrote inch at frontier airlines little harsh harsh\nA but I've got to say if you're trying to expand your horizons for what could be a ... a good pet turns out that I Know that rats believe it or not and this is really this is weird for some folks rats are pretty smart and can make good pets\nWhich when you see them in the subway to do here in New York City you think yourself why would anybody ever want to have one of those they look terrifying to carry all kinds of diseases but if you keep rats clean they are pretty smart and can make affectionate pets so I Would think a score it would be in the same category so that she there's a part of me John it's like hey\nMaybe she's got a really close bond\nWith this world maybe the squirrel is very meaningful to her and you can't separate a person from their emotional support squirrel but then there's the other side of me that had to wait for hours and hours just last week for Southwest Airlines flight that was delayed John it was supposed to take off as a one hour flight\nFrom Las Vegas to San Diego and it was going to take off at eight thirty in the morning to you know when that flight actually took off seven pm at night\nAlmost a twelve hour delay for not for weather weather as weather right that's\nThat's a that's got deciding that you're going to have a bad day or no for mechanical issues\nAnd I can tell you that I lose patients very quickly when I'm In that airport lab and not lounge airport area you know the little chairs they set up at all face each other it's kind of creepy sit there you have to look at somebody else he cannot be staring at them but you're staring at them\nAnd they don't want you to obviously you don't want to lose your temper uh but what can you do there's not much of a new show on the one hand I feel like emotional support squirrel I'm sympathetic on the other hand I feel like\nIf I were there and I was told that somebody was holding up my flight for\nA couple of hours so that they could have their emotional support squirrel handy or I might make some squirrel Bob I might just lose it\nAnd I bet squirrels probably not a particularly tasty meat but I Would see I find out one way or the other that squirrel that that emotional support squirrel would
