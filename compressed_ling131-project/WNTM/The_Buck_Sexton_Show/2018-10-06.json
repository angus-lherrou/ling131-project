and then our first hand me it was last week we had a little bit of a delay but the girls are the David said Murphy in Baker\nBoys came out there but that ...\nIs the goal of the regular season I I I Know we're trying to win the meat but are we trying to set times for state and that kind of the overall objective\nRight gold regular season is to get swimmers to qualify for section although spray news this is the third year that they've done that say you can qualify for ... regular season meat\nA little bit um I'd say easier it's not easy but it's easier to qualify for section ... than it is for state okay can't qualify for state in Tel the section on me\nRight no matter who you\nHave your worst day ever and you don't qualify for state that you had at a previous me it has to be done at instruction on me which is\n... and I assume that that is has to do probably with the accuracy of timing and all of that the assumption that\nEverybody's everybody's on the same clock in the same pool right\nRight and you know we have\nRegulation me me\nIt's not necessarily I don't have officials at our meats and we leave it up to the coaches are recognized whether the kids should be disqualified or not and so yes everybody's on the same playing field and bishop state there's the the timing pads and yeah official timing system and and all three sections do the same way so it's not like we're at a disadvantage you\nPress the same way I was in track with my daughters can be matter what you did really you could set all the more you want it but if you didn't do it in the ... you weren't going to be right and so for me to kind of I guess that makes them so [noise] especially just more like swimming were like so your parents helping out of all those ... ...\nTalk a little bit about your team

what the the divers do will do is have\nTold me a little bit before we move on because I'm kind of with the diving thing I'm scared to death of it so I don't know I don't understand how they do it are there certain dodge they have to do\nYes so there's six require dives worker and I couldn't real I'm all for you but and then they have six dives that they choose and of course [noise] more experienced you are you going to choose one's with higher difficulty because then you're score\nIncreases because there's a\nThere's a multiplier for difficulty if he kind of it's anybody's ever watch the Olympics uh yeah so um yeah but there are six and I think almost all of them have their six require die like that I have three seventh grade boys\nAll play football it cracks me up that I teach them to [noise] um ... [noise] and ah McNeil my stellar and ruin ... job summer league and they're like yeah we want to do it\nBut we can't practice in the evenings and so they go down to bishop said after football practice

past ... you know when we we have any of those coming to which are which are looking forward to watch them\nWe have um it's like we're upper class and heavy and lower class and heavy um [noise] probably are um [noise]\nMost successful swimmer from state last year coming back as Molly make narrow still swims first MSA [noise] and um she's already qualified for state and in most in every event that she swam she hasn't had many swims she's qualified for state and um Campbell\nLab is coming back she's a junior um she's qualified or very close to qualify for state she's on homecoming court

sexual right at well sex you know I yes\nI say states already slammed times ... yeah I have um ten girls have already qualified for section awesome so I could put them in all of our ... qualified for section of so we're\nReally good chance for section ... as far as because it's one eight to five a so we're going to be by next course yes I wanted to father ain't Paul's\nBecause of their success has moved up to six eight seven eight and they're\nThe only ones that ever beat us section so keep our fingers crossed everybody stays healthy they well defined there we've got seven boys that have already qualified for ... two of our realize you have a lot less boys so it's harder to get all three ... qualified rice with the boys but I'm\nFor the receiving group spreading it out to forty of receivers rushing it's all Simon Smith right now so I'm going with a sixty yards on eleven carries but he's got three touchdowns for the bulldogs when we've had draws a forty nine yours fifty five yards forty eight yards and so on and so forth and it's just been a good night we also had the blocked\nA pause for a touchdown for a human is right in the special teams group and Michael could ask her anything more gets in this a battle three into teams and and if this was it I think I think we were looking for a pretty good end of the season\nAnd it looks like it and you're right just domination and all three phases of the game and often Stevens a special teams and\nVery few mistakes and ah we were able to capitalize on what was a great game plan to start the game and how to attack with the past and a couple of route so we were able to see it early and I'm just jump on them so quickly and and take any kind of wind out of their sales or any kind of thought that they could come into corporate stadium and get the when I\nFirst Dr two plays\nSixty six yards and it was like\nStabbed him in the heart and then next job we block upon take it in its fourteen to nothing and they haven't even gotten they've had one first though right or\nYou know and and and they were going to count on big plate\n\nIs in ... say oh that's good reception is about ... first I should have been three yeah so it's not very I've ever been through\nThe two or three sex on top of that and ah it's just a it doesn't look like it doesn't look like they're going to vote on any kind of resistance suicide and you know you wonder what that\nWhat that does for a playoff rematch later on in the season you gotta think bodes well for us\nSo if we happen to see them again two or three rounds deep [noise]\nJust a psychological edge of\nOf of of a beat out like this yep 'cause we were\nKind of looking at the playoff situation you figure they're going to be in Williamson is probably going to be in and then a fourth place team down today in to lose this kind of going backwards a little bit I'm not really sure who could be right now it's just Gambia county and we haven't played them yet so

Cooper Stadium will ... got to come down at the twelve yard line to return rate is going to try to take it across the middle of the field nowhere to go uh for Kobe Bryant and he's going to be taken down there I Believe ... ...\n... right there on the Nineteen yard line in the winter the Cornel tournaments for the umpteenth here in a row number eight ... barber\nSomebody's going to get a chance to win that thing next next year named bar side somebody named Barbara or maybe look stringer will be up for it though just to the family tradition going\nTo go by thirty five to nothing here are scores the bulldogs a show some substitutions now on the defensive side of the ball with Chris evergreen having a first intense [noise]\nPay and the fake by the quarterback Mitchell he's going to try to roll out he's going to throw up late and he's going to get a completion has\nHe was getting track down from behind by coal oil and coal came from the left side of the defense hallway to the right side and took towel down at the Fifteen yard line but he was able to toss it too is a slot receiver at the twenty and he takes that to the twenty two yard line give him a couple of yards on the floor\nAnd he wanted her to them immediately but tolerance and I know and Tyler is thirty eight standing right next to them um\nAnd he's not able to throw it sets Davis was on there and oh here's a a hand off the pope the running back straight up the mental he's got a whole lot across the thirty to thirty five will stand him up there at the thirty eight\nAs we try to strip the ball out and uh [noise] Conrad engineer to stand up pope the running back but that's enough for a first down for Hillcrest evergreen out to their own thirty a yard line [noise]\nYou're right that was set Davis that outside linebacker position that was covering the receiver on the first employee number four and a nice person right there up through the metal\n... of the game it knows guard for the bulldogs\nI'm trying to get to change that\nSo pao the I'm\nJay Lynn pow the six one hundred and fifty pounds Junior's a quarterback he'll throw a quick slant ride over here to the left side and it's complete\nTo number sixteen Jacoby Brian out to the forty seven your mind and that was Conrad edge on the tackle for the bulldogs and that'll be a non your gain and bring up sucking down in one for Hillcrest\nBulldog sent for that time and nothing jet Barbara got might have gotten the hand on that path a little bit of a tip changed trajectory a touch [noise]\nThere's some confusion and they're ... they're running players off and on the quarterbacks ten yards behind the ball looking at the sidelines\nKnow huddle for Hillcrest evergreen there'd been that way all night two receivers go why did the right one receiver left into the boundary to backs in the backfield\nQuarterback wrote to his right you've got to look look nowhere to go he's going to cut it up to forty five fix it across the midfield line and spends the new fall down at the almost right forty nine yard line that will be enough for a first down his quarterback jail and tell her Powell runs it for the first down view of us right forty nine with nine forty seven to go here in the third quarter so\nCoverage sack I guess not because he didn't they got a couple of yards but coverage down the hill\nFantastic he has no one to throw the ball to and we also hinder ... pretty well didn't let them make a big play with the seat\nBeen price comes into the game and the left defensive tackle position for John rice and uh [noise] we're trying to develop some depth now that we've got a couple of guys out in the [noise]\nRotate in a few defensive lineman so pao the quarterback he'll go up under center I formation in behind\nHe'll give it to the running back pope deep into the backfield and there's a couple of defenders James ... couldn't link I got to say that right Clint link correct and I'm also spend price back there to help make the tack on hold him to uh to your gain and bring second down an eight now so the jaguars Hillcrest ever\nWhen Lee a freshmen and believed in prices and sophomores that room [noise]\nYep that is correct tied into the left for Hillcrest evergreen they're going to bring the quarter back up under center they're going to try to shorten his game I think you're a little bit second half\nHome [noise] play action passes we met the running back in the backfield and then the quarterback Paulos who's left the bass intended for pope out into the flag is going to go hide Sally completed it'll bring up third day you hear it everybody who\nWas released they didn't blow the whistle that time we are on the play action play\n[noise] who's in there on the blitz so I didn't see who who lives Colo and hit him [noise]\nQuarterback was lucky to get that ball out of there that could have been a disaster in the backfield for Hillcrest they'll go tied into left again to vaccinate backfield third Nate now they'll give it to the running back pope he'll break attack with the forty eight and then spit it to forty five cut it up inside and\nAll for it actually they're gonna marking down back at the forty three where's the it's a good spin move right there was that time by a\nGuess Joe get that tackles ... got in stumbling yeah Phil forward another two or three hours after jets wiped his leg\nSo forth and for let's call it and it'll bring up of punting situation now just saw the score Spanish shortly St Paul's fourteen and nothing over there that was going to be a kind of
