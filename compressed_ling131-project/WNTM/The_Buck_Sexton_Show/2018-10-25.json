that they happened and they say oh well we can't control every one they're favorable to\nThis stuff and now they're saying we all have to be civil and take the temperature down after Eighteen months of propagandize into their base the president's a traitor a sexist a rapist or a you know a racist or everything crazy going to start a war\nIs a fascist state there's stuff they've set up a President Trump and it's like nothing I've ever seen in my life it is like nothing I've ever it it truly is that there's nothing that even comes close now they're going to be the civility please come on\nWho takes this seriously is people are these people are really in need of reality check 'em really\nGot Joe Scarborough Scarborough if I if I just can't for a minute here I don't know Joe Scarborough never met them don't really care to a but\nThis is a guy who was his chummy chummy buddy buddy with the president as you could possibly be during the ... when it really mattered as a journal to be an objective for and I know scarred wasn't opinion guy but you know he's a member of the media and he had an opportunity to speak truth to power and all that but no he wanted to because you with power he wanted to be close to power\nAnd now because Trump has not him in Mika a now because Trump is something that's not the two of them he he goes on these anti Trump rage rants and first doing today is on Christ like I mean this is oh here's what's covers that play six\nHistory will look back and Americans will look back with shame that we ever had a president like this one a vet turned his back on the most basic [noise]\nNot only the most basic American concepts are what we defend our borders and and we should defend our borders people should only getting a here legally what Donald Trump's doing is\nNot only anti American\nI Will just say this is a guy that was raised in Southern Baptist church [noise]\nAt least based on\nThe Bible I read the gospels that I read the good Samaritan story that I read\nAnd some Christ like\nYeah that's right Joe Scarborough is going back to is oh so Christian roots and the\nSide in the Bible to criticize Trump I mean this guy has no shame no shame whatsoever\nI mean he goes over at MSNBC and uh ... that show up\nFor sale in the morning I hear so much blather and so much nonsense and as long as it's anti Trump you know the audiences you it's good to like the the works really it really is an embarrassment but you know people people believe what they want to believe unfortunately this world my friends\nAnd you know I'm hearing the swap what'd you find out more and more is that so many of these folks that that thinks that they're standing proud for the truth in the media they're really just it's all about their own their own brand their own paycheck on their own access all the time\nThey don't know what they do if they weren't doing his job and they just want to get his cause you to power responsible and if they're not in the Trump orbit they want to be as far away from it as they can so they can be in the anti Trump orbit\nAnd there's very few people that you can try to strike any kind of neutral balance anymore I mean this is just that this was a media war we're in the midst of a media war the notion that those who started this war in the mainstream media are the ones who are not calling for civility is just preposterous\nReally is um\nI went to argue about the mobs and all that coming up in a moment but ah we have we have we have much more just 'cause I don't want to be labor at this point to that because we don't know enough about the bombs I Do have Joey Jones coming on a little bit to talk about what we know about the devices themselves will get us on the technical aspects of this we're all really up to speed on that and and also just what\nIt takes to um you know get some of these\n... some of these devices what kind of skill set or we really talking about so we'll we'll get into of that I'll have an update for you on the on the caravan\nComing up a which\nIs all of a sudden out it's really going to drop out of the news cycle very quickly and I think it's because Democrats realized this is not the the Democrats pushing all of a side in their quest to do everything they can for illegals\nI'm not a winning issue for them and they they don't doesn't work out the way they

Jones now he is a a former marine and he was an EEO detect so he was all about explosive ordnance disposal Johnny Was was wounded in combat in his role as an EEO detect\nAnd that he knows everything about these devices how they're built\nHow you tracked them and what they can do a job and great to have you on that thank you so much\nYeah thanks for having me on today\nAre and so from what we know right now let's just go to the what what can we what can we say about these devices bunch of pipe bombs any signatures any sophistication or lack there are but what's notable to you about these bombs\n[noise] well you know I can only go off really the the information we be giving and and the one picture of the doubt there so I Want to put that out front say it's purely speculative are just going up what we see what we hear 'em in so what we saw it looks like a pipe bomb\nAnd it had some sort of timing device on the outside of it and why are they doing it for both defense\nAnd the idea there is this is a functional bomb what you would have the bonded either\nOnce that time or hit a certain time in a pre determined time in its past life it would\nTurn on a lie or sell the noise and so what you do you take that same signal that same electrical signal to re route that into a circuit that detonate the bombs so that one normally the light would come on the bond that NATO but normally the bell would ring when an alarm clock\nThe bond that nature of the other way it could have been used would be to arm it so it was switches or breaking a circuit than arming at arming mechanism is another breaking the circuits so the circus still open but wants the army and gets closed in the next thing they closed the switch will set it off so\nWe know in in the use of devices\nUsed for one of two things either to determine when the bomb goes off or to keep yourself with the bomb maker time to get away from it\nBefore it's armed and so if this bond with the functional device which I have my own doubts that are suspicious about what I could see in that picture but if it's a if it's a functional device and we certainly have to treat it that way then we would call this a time device or other time to arm or trying to debt date\nAnd being that it was in a seal package and there seems to be no other true mechanism of of the nation then we kind of have to believe from what we can see that picture that at the time to detonate device meaning they said\nYou know a certain amount of hours on that timer and when it runs up it would theoretically detonate\nNow that's going to be a very I mean I I Would assume Joey you mean this this is going to be a very\nUh ... the sloppy way to try to target an individual right I'd be assuming this was actually sent\nThrough the mail to just have a timing device on it you have to be guessing when it would be you know it just sounds like it's more likely could blow up still a risk that people could really could kill somebody but could blow up in the mail processing center in the mail man's hand perhaps or eight on any number of phase is not including the targeted individual\nWell you know it it becomes one of those talking points where I really need to think through how much is going to\nDabble in detail to any audience because you just never know who's listening and there are certain things that you know our best are best kept secrets keep us alive or not go into too much detail about how boundary made about\nNinety percent of what you put into a bomb as readily available at Walmart any information on the Internet there's one or two components really one specific part of the bomb that is really hard to make yourself and it's even harder to get a hold of manufactured\nAnd and so what we have right now this is a fleet of I speak meaning that it could function as as as it appears to\nThen uh then that components within the pie and if they can exploit or a take apart what is there to recover some of those pieces then perhaps there's some signatures so specific parts of the pieces that can\nMore easily points in the right direction when I Would say where do you really I'm just like an off in a shipping of the package if\nYou know the one that we're looking at now seems to be the hand delivered by courier but there's questions about the postage and was it actually put through a a delivery service or that someone just hand this package to someone else thought hey I'll give you twenty dollars a ticket that you're already we don't know and those those leads those human lead\nThe tracking the shipment that's the first place will go in the meantime someone probably over ... go with the FBI utilize some tools and techniques we add the safely disassembled Islam\nGet full details

yelled at until they had to leave restaurants all conservatives is that okay with you know I Am okay with Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen and Mitch McConnell yes\nMuch O'Connell is more dangerous salmonella in that restaurant any why Hillary Clinton tried and I walk up when they do but I\nIt it's not clear that there was Hillary she leans Seventy something being unpleasant\nAnd something being okay I'll take your protesting something you're just in Green Bay decorated children from their parents and I went to dinner and a Mexican restaurant I wouldn't ... high endorsed third term\nSo there you have the big separation okay I especially in a day like today where we're going to be a lecture by the left about about\nCivilian all of a sudden he didn't mind that in that exchange that was an Tucker Carlson show not tonight but last night uh that exchange was between a very senior and trusted Clinton Hillary Clinton aide Felipe rains\nAnd of course Tucker who people will say looks like book so it's bucking took a where people say that I look like Tucker but they don't know if they don't know anything because clearly Tucker looks like me but\nThey're having this exchange and you notice that that he makes it clear range makes it clear that to him and this is true of many other Democrats are I Know the harassment and stocking and mob tactics of the left against politicians are people they don't like\nThat's acceptable they don't\nSay oh sorry this is just some other thing you know this is just some other group that we don't we don't indoors we're not associated with this isn't representative of us they actually try to justify this behavior and I keep having to point out to people that the the line between\nI mean if I were in a restaurant and forty people were up in my face and I was with my girlfriend or my spouse or whatever a worry miserable family members or friends and people were cursing at me and yelling at me and threatening me the line between that activity and someone getting their nose broken\nOn either by me or buy them right I mean on one side of the other is that line is\nVery thin very small objects is one person who thinks they're going to give you a little show of one person who just crossed easily they're already screaming airspace they're already yelling at a restaurant there already embarrassing you humiliating you\nAnd trying to intimidate you you really think it's that hard for one of them all of a sudden you know give a little short give a little push and things get out of control\nYou know the answer to that\nBut what showing poured ears that the left I you know as soon as those idiots when after Nancy Pelosi I said an every other conservative but I Know and and respect came out and said those people are are more on\nWhat they're doing is a disgrace and not only is their behavior wrong but by acting in that way and they they really did the progressive left or to the ... the Democratic party a big favor\nA but\nOh by the way they talk specifically about that it rains 'cause they they have to pretend there's some consistency Rangel's say as he did a Carlson oh no that's okay what did it blows he's okay Twenty one\nSo is it okay to scream at Nancy Pelosi until she waves restaurant and the answer is no it's not okay I'd never okay I think what happened that she thought she was fine\nThe other day she was ... and ... she was with her to do any you don't see any of us up and said they ethical ... I'm going to yell at you until you leave the palm because you have a ... policy I disagree with [noise]\nI think an older person would say you got to go out and that's not what happened was I just don't do it because they're not lost in the last ...\nLook I think it needs to be said and I appreciate the Tucker set it and you know thank God that people like talk or have the kind of plot for may do or they can push back on this nonsense no conservatives we had a political culture and our political culture in this country is unacceptable to\nA you know surround people when they are engaged in private activity now who say they're in public but I mean they're not\nThey're not out of you know they're not on stage they're not and look I think the behavior when they're on stage is bad but it's just it's just different degrees right it's one thing if you want to make a lot of noise and heckle people on Capitol Hill I think that's childish and stupid you should get arrested but I don't think that it's\nYou know I I don't think this is certainly dangerous to the people writing to Capitol police there and there's you know those cameras there but when you're in a restaurant and you think that\nKnow ... where does that stop what about waiting for somebody outside their home\nYou know I Wonder where Democrats think about that can forty people wait wait outside your apartment in in uh on Capitol Hill are and what you know downtown Washington DC if you're a member of the house the Senate\nAnd and they can they follow you can they fall ever you go you know this whole notion of ... in public so they can be a target of or disdain now oh they're in a restaurant I mean I really get angry when I hear them a Democrat said things like\nOh sorry that could just you know enjoy the frog legs is is that there are the table well people are losing their health care of it just is childish talking points stupidity you know you're a lot of the older the ... the roast chicken while the poor people\nOf America are suffering right I mean they they try to create this whole narrative justify the crafts their whiny screening children and they act out and they throw tantrums and then they want the media to tell them that those tantrums are okay and the media darts\nAnd important political figures I mean as much as you think he's got Felipe rains are Ryan represents names important\nSo this is this is the distinction they're not hiding that they're okay with this behavior not only do they do this stuff and we really don't or at least we rarely our side rarely does they celebrate they endorse when their side is engaged in mob tactics and they really hope that the American people forget that\nBefore election day [noise] really interesting study I saw this week about how people uh don't really trust Facebook that much any more we'll that's really not surprising is it when you see all of the stories out there\nAbout shadow banning about gaming the algorithm so bad it pushes progressive causes and shuts off discussion about things like the second amendment about free speech about any number of issues that are really important too\nConservative that's why we need a space where there's none of that agenda or censorship [noise] nippy dot com maybe dot com is a new social media platform that you can join and share your thoughts and know that there's nothing getting in the way\nOf your conversations with whomever you want you can follow people check out the news feed look what's your favorite writers up to and put your thoughts their S.

you know they're they're the ones you always have to play this game on things like immigration which is why that Obama soundbite where he said you know you can't you can't sneak into this country it's

call out the fair Margaret Traub is normal one other thing I Would add to the Democrats should it ought to say is that people playing some of these countries are playing some of these countries because of condition is created by Republican foreign policy\nParticularly in the Reagan Administration when you have a problem with those images wind go back over time and see why these countries on the condition that they are right\nThat's right folks it's American foreign policies fault that Honduras is a a hell hole of crime and corruption and violence it's America's fault you see every country anywhere in the world that's in bad shape is somehow are full that's the view of the left\nAnd it also informs their immigration policy don't think that that's just a throw away\nBecause the progressive in this country believe that America has only become so rich and powerful on the backs of the third world and essentially the non white regions of the globe\nThat is a widespread left wing belief you see it in in uh in academia you see it and\nMedia uh this is not unusual at all and in fact some of the Obama administration\nApproach to foreign policy was also informed by this idea that America is why there was all the bowing and the apology toward America has has a lot to apologize for\nAnd the dysfunctions in Central America or somehow according to left is\nThe fault of America and therefore we shouldn't be saying hold on a second ... you know we we can't force the American taxpayers to subsidize all the dysfunction all the problems in Central America that's not fair they say oh no no no\nYou owe that to them and see this is a fascinating and very destructive world view of the left has but it informs the Democratic party's foreign policy and the basics of it are that anything that we\nHave to do when it comes to immigration one of the weather is taking in refugees are taking in illegals that is going to be exact cost upon the American taxpayer\nIs completely justified\nBecause we owe them you see it's our fault that these countries\nAren't more prosperous are so corrupt um it it's always our fault and left view and really what it is a globalized victim allergy\nRight that that other countries there people are victims of the United states and therefore the Democrats need to be in charge in this country to make amends for all that victimization I Know
