I work with law enforcement when they're in the system they're convicted that maybe they surf ten years\nWhen it comes time to come out there's a painter requests from ice you either turn him over to ice or release them into the community that's the only two options Andrew will not answer the question me let me would be willing to release center out there and said\nHe won't answer the question that was give them an dissent is a dissent is was the one who's pushing them on that issue\nBoth candidates for ah ah for the governor of Florida\nAnd and trying to\nYou know trying to get that last push here as we get very close and people are going to look at Florida they're going to say\nThere is a bellwether state this tells you a lot about the direction of the country for the midterm election they're going to say that this is you know really uh depends if the Democrats win it if you and wins who is the mayor of Tallahassee\nAnother person who I don't think they're going to run him and twenty twenty but they see him in a young a charismatic\nObama ask mole so a lot of Democrats very excited about\nAbout Gillum and you know it was a ... a socialist I mean he's pretty he's pretty open about he wants single payer and he wants\nTo raise taxes all but he won't say that ... was a bunch of things and you know we'll find some way\nBut just asked us was pushing them here on the issue of ice detained request\nAnd notice a bill and would not answer because what this really is the question about sanctuary city policies sanctuary cities do notch now there's some variations year depending on which jurisdiction of the ... century city as a as a general rule do not\nAdhered to or do not on her\nI ... what that means is when someone is already in custody of law enforcement and immigrations and Customs Enforcement is informed that that person is in custody they send to detain request if they want that person to be turned over to them for the purposes of deportation\nThey\nRefuse sanctuary city jurisdictions refused to do that and what this and just knows and he'd been a prosecutor is it that means that there are people who are a danger to the community who are convicted criminals people who have served sentences including sometimes for violent crimes\nAnd local jurisdictions because of the politics around illegals and because of the pandering to generally the Latino community by Democrats\nJurisdictions will not honor these chain of requests which means that people who are criminals and illegal aliens get released back out into the general population and can become repeat offenders\nAnd this is really a question of do you believe\nThat law enforcement should work together you know I cannot think of another issue where if the FBI requested uh for example the FBI requested help from a sheriff or local law enforcement they wouldn't just knock it help they will be stonewall we refused to help you as a matter of policy\nRight and people realize that there's a lot of crossover there's a lot of ways unfortunately but it is true\nThat even local crimes can get tangled up in the federal Web\nSo there are ... and just the FBI's viewed as a legitimate law enforcement body by most folks and so there's a lot of cooperation between those reading I here here's a verb example I work in the MIT intelligence division I was sitting in a city with seeded with pardon me a\nSuited with an FBI agents DEA ... ah people from all these different federal immigrations and Customs Enforcement all these different agencies were all singing to gather because stuffed them come on my radar would also be on their radar and we worked together as a fusion center that's what I was doing that's my ... and of course also it\nOn the federal counterterrorism side in particular\nBut we understand that there's a lot of crossover law enforcement will somebody who is a drug dealer who's also illegal alien is causing problems for the law and multiple ways and one law enforcement agencies should support the other law enforcement agencies legitimate law enforcement functions\nWould give him is telling you without telling you is that he prefers lawlessness because it is politically advantageous\nHe won't say it but dissent is was right to push him on this one and this then goes to a a refrain that you heard a lot from a lap and I really hope becomes a huge problem for them in the in the midterms which is remember when\nRace that I don't think you get nearly enough a judge and you got the NATO obsessed media\nTalking all about how he's going to be Ted Cruz when now that just laughable but there's another race that maybe deserves a second look here at least for what it tells us about the Democratic party if not what it tells us about the\nPossibility of this race going for the Republicans Kim Strasser will join just not talking about what's going on in New Jersey she's a peace up on the wall Street Journal where she is on the editorial board smiling at corruption\nDemocrats tried to save Bob Mendez months after his bipartisan as admonished bitch a Kim great to have you back and it's great to be here\nAll right what's going on in in the Garden State which I always feel a certain love hate relationship for the New Yorker what's going on up there\n[noise] yeah well you said you know what's notable here that while the entire media felt obsessing over Texas where those numbers look Ted Cruz is is that not like pulling away from paid off work there's a ... it's even within a smaller margin of error and in New Jersey where a Democrat Bob Menendez\nWhen you mentioned um he was censored by my colleague rather monitor ... by his colleague back earlier this year on after he had been found to have accepted also get from a man who is now convicted felon who ran one of the biggest Medicare fraud on government an all time\nI'm not only was expecting a lot of gifts from that guy and not acknowledging that under Senate Ethics rules but he was working on behalf of the guy to help them with his business interests in Washington including done so far it's a lot of health and Human Services secretary on his bat\nSo um he he was actually indicted for this or that that the ultimate Lee I'm Sorry ... department of justice ultimately dropped the charges after the Supreme Court\nThat changed the standard on on what it would take to convict him but he wasn't honest and he's now facing a very ... race against Bob Uganda Republican businessman who's been highlighting this and it it's really dry I favor\nHow'd you say there's a a deafening silence Kim\nFrom so many of the au Jared Kushner must have some shady relationship with Saudi Arabia I I hear this people are media all the time and I said okay well what is it and then there's there's nothing there's all these whispers of corruption around Trump meanwhile Menendez who\nWhether people want to just parse out the legality of what he did or not what he did was gross and the guy he was associated with even grosser and they're just hoping that Bush has got a line for the Democrats\nYeah many Democrats are actually out there running a campaign focused on so called Republican corruption ... are actually handed out to her members aid to catch\nA talking point about how they oppose it go after Republican corruption Trump and and all sorts and butter issues none of which as you said there was any real evidence for but in the meantime they just closer I did that in some cases\nActually are outright helping I mean well the Democrat that's why I called they called smiling at corruption\nAt the biggest superPAC out their majority superPAC helping Senate Democrat is decided to re route ... dollars to help Bob Menendez in his race I might or taking away from an even more important races for them or where they're trying to unseat\nOn and places where Trump won um because of you so much trouble the ... and ... isn't the Democratic party say hey you know what we're OK with corruption I get there is all trail of evidence that very clear in fact the senators on record saying that he engaged in corruption but we're still going to do everything we can return to office\nYeah and I have to say that there are two areas where I see a tremendous or boxing loving to one of them is on this\nUh as as on the notion of corruption which as you pointed out is is a talking point against the Republicans but you have so many Democrats you start to think of it all the Democrats that have gone to prison and just in the last oh four or five years for incredibly obvious and very shady corruption\nAnd that never gets brought up in any of this discussion as I said there's always this vague oh Trump most you know someone started telling me about the Mali ... that tends to be what I hear about\nA but also on on the notion of moms I I just say I am I have been surprised and I take a very dim view of much of the\nOf the journalists class which I Know technically you definitely are journalists on something else but I'm pretty close to journal land but most journalists I think act in a way that is really surprising to me but on the mobs Kim\nI'm seeing a lot of people would say you know they have no other they have no other way to make their case and these are people that write for the Washington Post\nIt's it's crazy looking absolutely unacceptable okay the whole reason we have civil society we have it\nSee if we don't have mob rule just because you're citing when an election just because your person didn't get in office or just because you lost your Supreme Court nomination\n... definitely nothing written in any of that they're more informed holes in our society they give you the right to shape Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz added ... hound them at a restaurant\nUm ... ... ... per se I see why we have a ballot box elections and anybody who's out there whether it's on CNN I end up on their way and well I Am not a ma and be they're just saying what they think we all know that's not\nTrue I'm saying what you think is when you write an op ed or a letter to a newspaper or you go to vote\nBut you know harassing people on the street is not and that's the best it got and conservatives should actually feel pretty good that they're winning on the policy merits\nNow I Know that it's it's really tight and so to to ask you to make her production and who really knows but just in a minute or so we have less you're Kim how to eat where what's the main dynamic UC right now in the house race that's going to determine whether it ends up being the Republican the Democrats win the day\nBut I think the most important thing which they weren't hearing like mainstream media is how different it is today than it was just three weeks ago okay we can stay with complete definite proof\nThat the Democrats the blown it to a certain extent [noise] ah they were talking about a wave three weeks ago they messed up with Kavanaugh it's not going to be a way I think it's going to come down by the one way or the other right on whoever does when you're not going to have a huge majority but I think Republicans are still in\nHer eye gives dress let me put it on the wall Street Journal check out her columns also her book the intimidation game Jim always appreciate you make the time for us come back soon\nAnd\nYeah I I think you have a swat on there with the it's gonna be five seats is going to be such a narrow margin I don't think that we're going to know we're certainly not going to know who controls the house by the time I'm although you should listen for all of the show electrified obviously but we're not going to know who control the house I think I'm by\nThe time this show is is over um I think it's going to stretch well I guess the polls closed around age there's no way we would know OK yeah it does not even close but we might not even know till\nI don't maybe the next morning it's going to just going to be drawn out\nAnd it's going to be very very tight which goes to tell you you know they've been telling us the Trump is a fascist and destroying America\nAnd now they're praying and hoping that they can not have a blue wave but a little blue ripple a little bit [noise]\nIt's crazy right now you got the left freaking out chasing people at a restaurant screaming at little old ladies

C. they really think that there's a national they don't want anyone to tell them otherwise\nAnd this is always I always get the sense from all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know that that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just oh it's horrifying to them\nWork with the pleads again oh no many of them have never done that by the way\nThey go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the pathway anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads and then you have this whole conspiracy theory about pushing her and Mohammed bin ... where the ... cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get to ignore them that's a fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis any meaningful way for running one of the crappy as countries on her despite all of its oil wealth\nNo administration no president including Obama who was bowing literally bowing to the Saudis okay so everyone needs to just blow their role and chill out on this\nStop making this about cheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do it they don't care about this guy to show the they have a little more solidarity with them they would otherwise because he was not even sure he's a columnist\nThe guy was and it is an opinion writer for the now I'm not saying that means that you know anything as it happened to him but the way they're talking about him it's like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile has anybody ever writes an opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment\nIn terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked I mean ... an American conservative Web and attack somewhere else in the world you hear a lot less outrage about this just the fact\nIt is just the if if it was someone who are critical of fundamentalist Islam and that was the primary attack that Islam in Saudi Arabia is a destructive oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis took that guy out there and say well\nYou know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered and but they're you know there's a lot of Islamophobia meanwhile if you've been bring up the cause she'll be was and this is a fact and Islamist meaning he believed in political Islam\nAnd was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood is like your trampling on the man's great that's that's just telling the truth\nHe wasn't Islamist nobody he wouldn't do not as if he were alive nobody denies it doesn't mean you should have been brutally murdered oh I I almost left out that he\nAlso a ... they dressed somewhat up as a body double and his clothing after they killed him to try to create footage of leaving so that was the plan they they were going to try to or they must not have known that the fiance was outside because they were going to try and say that he left and that they had no knowledge and ... they were going to disappear and\nThat was the plan to disappear him and they are just really\nReally dumb about it let me give you a little bit of in jail agency inside here in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign intelligence often operates there this is a little bit of an inside baseball for you like that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very effective their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain\nRegimes security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are their primary concern is right regime and keeping the people in power in power and stopping any threats against them most countries aren't really worried about foreign invasion most countries are worried about toppling from from the inside um and\nThey get very adept to dealing with that threat but\nThey also often operate in places where they can be really ham fisted I guess that's kind of the wrong term for Saudi Arabia but you know what I mean they can be clumsy and sloppy and get away with it\nAnd that's what I think happened here the Saudis the Saudi intelligence services the Saudi police state can be selfish in Saudi Arabia and can be thug dish in other Middle Eastern countries where they have a lot of sway\nCan't really be self sufficient turkey\nAnd that may have been the miscalculation here they thought that they could get away with this and they're not used to operating on foreign soil where there is also a very by the way sluggish intelligence apparatus apparatus that is at work\nSo a lot of intrigue here we'll be right back\nThere's been a change in the last few months people have started to realize that social media platforms are not a public utility they're not they're just for the free exchange of ideas they are Internet companies but they're also media outlet they are platforms and they make editorial decisions all the time and guess what\nThe big ones out there are making editorial decisions that favor Democrats progressive and the left and they're doing it on a regular basis you know this you heard about the shadow banning you've heard about the

[noise]\nAgo the presidential race I have never seen there and like I see right now I think the Republicans are going to do very well\nTired of high taxes which we gave the tax cuts we've got so much\nThat they want a strong military they want protected they want safety they want security weekend that the Democrats do not have that the Democrats don't know what they're doing they don't know what they're given I think we're going to do very very well in the rise yeah you're\nNot in terms right I think that we're going to pick up a Senate seat something's going to be fifty five you heard it or for fifty five Republican Senate seats by by the end of this thing not quite the super majority of sixty although it would not be sweet\nMidterms going to be tight I mean a house rather intimate church going to be tight very very tight I I think it could go either way right now and it's going to be just a few seats that separate the Democrats and Republicans at the end the day but Trump is incredibly\nPowerful voice in this whole debate and discussion I think that he's really making a very he's making the case very well which are the Democrats don't actually have an agenda or a platform other than trying to restore the legal and cultural and as fish of Obama Islam\nWhile Trump is president and they're ... they won't be able to do that so this is really just going to be much more a rhetorical battling much more fighting it out in the media and nastiness and it it really is it is moms or jobs\nAnd Republicans need to hammer that home the point that I think they're on that and they're doing\nThey're okay and they could be stronger on this\nBut on health care I'm furious with the Republicans because they don't have a unified message and because of a couple of very\nUnreliable GOP senators we don't actually have\nA real achievement to speak of in a in the healthcare realm and Obamacare is garbage in Trump is allowing people to get out of the individual mandate but that and also giving states more flexibility in this but they need to be telling people what that means and what it does for them\nYou know they are not effective messengers on health care and that could be I really do think if if the Democrats when that when the house it's going to be because of that issue on the Senate side however\nTed Cruz versus a bet to Rourke are no surprise here Trump is going out there to Stanford Stanford head and I just thought the thought this was a nice moment in your play play quip twenty as Trump's on his way to Texas\nThat live in\n\nHad I had a very

Wesley Lowery at the Washington Post he ... he wrote over the weekend after this Mitch McConnell saying\nQuote yelling and elected officials in public is protected First Amendment speech and it's pretty disgusting to seat journalists lecturing our fellow citizens for directly petitioning government officials\nLike the ... brains clip everything he said here as it is wrong\nIn in ... an hour ... yes it is is protected speech but that's irrelevant because they're protected speech we're talking about here in a restaurant no one's saying the government has a right to come in and arrest these people but the establishment can say get out your trespassing this is private property\nThey have that right to you know the the left thinks that the first amendment means they get to say\nWhatever they want an act however they want and nobody else gets to say anything about it because we're infringing on their right by exercising our right they don't understand this they have no concept of\nA of rights existing in parallel to each other you know somebody can say something really stupid about Trump and I can say that was really stupid that doesn't mean that I'm getting their First Amendment right\nIf I you know put tape over their mouth and locked him in a closet that's probably kidnapping but also it's that's negating their First Amendment right\nIf I refuse to give them a permit to speak and a public park when I get that permit to other people to speak in a public park because of viewpoints discrimination that's not respecting their first met right but in a restaurant no you don't have the right to go into a restaurant and act like a moron or any more than he has a right to go to a restaurant and play your\nYou know boom box which we used to have some you remember we used to have those the eighties and nineties poop [noise] the boom box you remember he's carried around with you I remember how cool you were high school was almost directly correlated with how big your speakers were you know you want a big speakers then you were really cool\nI was little speakers were much more that if we pleasing and people like why do you like little speakers book\nAnd and what are they going to speakers there there was a guy there was a public pool that I Would go to 'em over the we are we're not really public but a community pool whatever that I used to go to over the summer and then the guys to show up there\nWith and he would bring every time he was there he would bring a little outdoor speaker with him and play his weird Buddha Bar lounge music and and I just think that that's such an a to Z weird thing to do like everybody else the pool wants to hear your music\nIn the ... that's a bold thing to do to inflict on ever bring a Bluetooth speaker with you you can blast your music at a pool with a hundred people\nI think that's very very strange\nUm and I think that you know it's it's something that people should not do anyway back to Mitch McConnell what's going on here and this guy was Lee at the Washington Post\nIs essentially a doesn't understand where the first amendment stops and starts and you see this from a lot of journalists which you think that people who make a living from the first amendment would have a better understanding of it but their understanding of the first amendment is they have special rights in privileges and everybody else needs to just deal with it\nUm but that's not the way that's not the way this is supposed to function that's not how this is supposed to go\nAnd for the Philly branch thing I wanted to say that we're giving comfort to white nationalism and we're uh I I hate this talking point it's so vile it's so despicable and unfair and they keep saying all the time and it's just a way of shutting down any on his political dialogue\nWhich is why people like me and increasingly set of last six months you know what the Russia collusion thing now they know they can't win that you're just you're just going to see that same\nThat same mentality that same insane tenacity around an issue where they think they can destroy the president that's going to be\nA expanded to cover any number of things so that the the craziness that led them to believe that Russia collusion was going to bring down the president that same level of just was char\nOr will now be on everything the twenty Fifth Amendment stuff the can front of people in restaurants because that was just the that was the place where you had the first real symptoms of Tron trumped arrangements syndrome\nThe first major symptom was Russia is going to bring down the presidency it's really going to happen Trump is a Russian du jour Russian pawn where it's just a matter of time before we prove it and now you see that because that's just not going to work\nThere now pushing out into everything else and you're seeing the same and Saturday when the leap brains they're saying that you know it's it's not a big deal that people were yelling at Mitch McConnell and remember you know what I'm saying these people should be arrested were just saying they're idiots\nAnd people shouldn't do this and we should be able to share that opinion without people so you get your your opinion that's destroying the first amendment no it is not\nIt is not and uh I I just think that this is one of these places where you know you either have principals don't abide by the way I'm not skipping over we just don't have unless you're there were there were a bunch of people that were harassing Nancy Pelosi over the weekend too\nThey are total ... okay they absolutely should not should not\nBe given any respect or any you know an approval from any one I heard somebody say they were the Proud Boys I don't know I just know that there was a video of people\nSorry I'm getting over coal to my voice has been really shaky last week video of people who ... yeah that's right I called I did the show every day I don't miss the show him sick 'cause I Love all of you so much and I can't I Can't skip a day and the freedom huh\nUnless I have a work thing I have to do but that's where\nA but the people yelling at below sea they've done nothing to help their cause a lot to harm it or if their cause is and I and I don't know what their causes I'm assuming it's just anti left wing something\nBut the left you are doing their huge favor no matter who you are if you say you're on the right and I know some people are talking false flag I haven't seen any evidence of that\nIf you say you're on the right and you are screaming and yelling people on the left now you give them the ability to say oh see both sides are doing it when both sides are doing it but that one case will be magnified so those in Brussels who were banging on doors and yelling at below sea have done the far left\nA huge favor\nI just saw the c._e._o. of global verification network last week here in DC we caught up for a while I said hey mark how's business he's had business is great we've
