Neal Blue eagles they run a little inside hand off on a counter tray action to the wing back and he'll take it from left to\nRight and cut it up to twenty five and falling forward to the thirty yard line that'll be enough for a first down for ws Neal on their second drive of the game they're first first down to the evening I\nHad to get to the thirty and it looks like the nose at all it's just over the paint but will play out of their time out the execution to pick up first down for the blue eagles [noise]\nThey'll sprout us out one receiver left one right the quarterback all fake it and then take it off the right side on the keeper take it out to the thirty two yard line not much to go not much room to run over there for the quarterback Thomas and he'll get to bring up sucking down and they\nBring number twenty two in motion towards us Todd on like a jet sweet type action and then the quarterback keeps it off the right side and a power play [noise]\nBand is rocking and rolling tonight they're ready to go [noise]\nComing off there still are a performance and the musical Addams family the band was a strong performer that show quarterbacks gonna drop back and throw it hits route out here in the left flat it's complete areas Harrison the wide receiver to twenty five he'll take it out to the twenty six and it'll bring up third data for now for\nThe blue eagles ws Neal what a good throw in a good catch for the for ws Neal and secondarily\nThere was an Harris fusing tight man coverage and bomb them immediately as he catches it\nSolo and comes in to provide the system the tackled\nBelieves in third and for for the eagles [noise]\nOne receiver left one receiver right they were wing back in the game to the left side to backs in the backfield the quarterback will be in shock and formation\nThey'll throw another here threw out here in the left that has to earn less sideline to Jennings Hobbs and it's completely stuck that went in there to thirty nine yard lines it's going to be short of a first down you know the one of those places I don't quite understand when you run around when you need five and you only run for your ground\nA little get thrown a good catch on third down but it'll bring up a funding situation now for the blue eagle\nOr watch tears view on that play and they had to get to the forty and he dug his heels in to forty in almost forced him to shorten that hitch and and be short of it and then he was on him immediately [noise]\nSo the eagles will punted away to the [noise]\nGoing to go to the right side had been whites gonna try to make the catch at his own thirty three yard lied he will call affair gets a fair catch at that point and make the catcher's ws Neal did a good job covering that one that was kind of a knuckleball was installed\nIt was it was spending like a a helicopter rare it's just rotating in a very awkward way and\nLooked like a difficult catching you had to die forward in the last moment to make the play and [noise] personally did without incident Washington\nYeah they market brought out to thirty two yard line so you must write will have their first officer series of the night here with five fifty to go in the first quarter we lead seven about that after an ed when white [noise]\nTouched down on the return on the first series of the game Simon Smith alone back in the ... century receive or so left in the boundary [noise] ... skipper snipes up under the center he'll run counter to the left\nHe'll get hit it to thirty to maybe get to thirty three still trying to\nPull forward but maybe a yard on the game a lot of a lot of white jerseys on each arm is with us he worked his way through the whole\nWell they're very crowded towards our line loaded up on the run\nAnd skipper comes up and takes the cost of the white side of the field\nAnd Simon comes back inside on the counter and met\nSeveral white jerseys right at the line [noise]\nNo gain on the play bring up second down in ten [noise]\nLeft hatched tied into that gets people to the right will send two receivers left into the boundary again [noise]\nSaid no but the pullback in motion from left or right we're going to run the counter boots skippers got all kinds of pressure in his face he's going to stand up and throw it out into the right flat and it'll be incomplete when he was trying to get a tanker scoop referred to earlier because we know that are today it will be athlete but yet\nOr close the T shirt cannon just shy of shooting a shot the T shirt clear over the press box while that scares me I didn't I wasn't paying the least bit of attention\nThen he turned the juice down on that all of that going to bring somebody somebody's head off with a T shirt and the next one goes to rise to\nHide St play this time to the right side Simon waitress block from the urban art and cuts it up inside of him at the eight takes it inside to five worry high steps over a defender\nTakes it down to the to yard line on the top sweep all around the right side so the bulldogs trying to stick to the running game on the outside with Simon just wrote a toss we laughed and then saw sweet bright and we have a second goal to two\nGreat patients from Simon right there waiting on no way to get outside and block that edge and then he cuts right inside of them and it was like we are about three yards from Peter [noise]\nWs Neal brings in a goal on fraud [noise]\nAn extra defensive lineman\nHumorous right brings X and X often some blonde and working on the hand off the stocks sweep around the left side of the gym barber\nAnd he takes it in for the touchdown says the senior outside linebacker gets into the ball game at the back position and gets to the touchdown prevail mess right with nine fifty five to go here in the second quarter comes around\nThe left the edge and all the way outside the hash marks for turning up field and takes a little lake right at the goal line than getting the better of it for sure the score six\nSo to yard gain for ... for\n... barber and the touchdown for the senior linebacker [noise]\nHim a Terry Curtis known to do that but some are senior defenders in there to let them try to score again and again we're too [noise]\nProceed kick is up and it is good for nine fifty five to go here and the second quarter you a mess right go six plays fifty yards and his capped off by two yard touchdown run by the full back yet barber to take the fourteen to nothing lead here at home against ws Neal\nAnd that's the only our second drive of the game and already two touchdowns yeah hands\nPoems and special team such down I guess we didn't\nScore on the other one [laughter]\nBut yeah seems like a the the plan of ws Neal's holding to form they are trying to shorten the game run the clock and we've only had to drive but still at fourteen to nothing\nWould love to see I run a game you go and I'm looking forward to seeing what the coaches due to\nNine in the box strategy of the blue eagle\nWe're talking about a little bit for the game started Terry Curtis real mess right the head coach in his twentieth season here you know mess right last week's whatever's Gambia county was tears two hundred and twenty a victory since coming to you mess right forty nine losses overall two hundred Ninety seven victories so\nIf we can keep it going coach ... should have is a three hundred victory in the second round of the playoffs or what a milestone for any coach really to yeah to make three hundred to two Twenty years or less right having two hundred and twenty victories average and eleven victories of season that's pretty impressive [noise]\nHigh so will push these kick comes down to Fifteen your mind the return mail to try to shake it straight up the middle and he'll read the bulldogs right after twenty two maybe the twenty three yards on trying to do the first one down there was I was ... and Graham Jackson Graham hits the return man that was number twenty areas Harrison and a\nPretty good lick right there he put on the ... got\nStrong sophomore cars and makes that play and had\nA Conrad inch coming right in behind and help clean it up\nOnce again they're pins deep like they keep getting about five yards better every time there at the twenty three years so that sounds\nGood to see cameras snipes back in the game coach at the left defensive tackle position he's been out a couple of weeks by noon listen to [noise] I've got to see him back and give James cone way as a blow and we try to develop some depth getting ready to head into the playoffs [noise]\nBy formations ws Neal they'll give it to the second back through off the left side the running backs got a little Greece's he takes it out to the twenty five and then the bulldogs will clamp down on him and right after twenty six yard line so to maybe a three hour game for the running back on my own correct for the movie for\n[noise] Harris few coming in off the edge to make that tackle what a\nGreat forum tackled from Harris to wrap\nNo yards after contact for the [noise]\nSidelined warning for us [noise]\nGot two in the play actually the running back there to bring second down and ate formation again tied into the left actually two titans into the game one receiver to the right they're gonna want to play\nQuarterbacks going to roll out to his left he's going to hell or high into the dragging mix of one hand it's unbelievable sketched\nOut about the thirty seven yard line he'll go down at the forty ... they're going to call him down on contact to completion to number eight Taylor fountain six to two hundred and Seventy pounds I'd in reached up with his left hand made a one eight and grab and that's what first down ... legal\nAnd he's well covered on that underneath crossing route and thrown behind them and he has to reach back almost behind his head with his left hand and pause it holds onto it and advances a few hours after that and then he he did follow the ball referees determined that the ground calls that and it was\nFrom the tackles the remains ws Neal football\nSo first and to enter the ws Neal forty one yard line Let's call it the right has two receivers lied to left wondering receiver to the left or the right side they'll try to run the isolation play off the right side job Bob are steps up stuff sits\nAlong with that John rice and the rest of the bulldog defense and there'll be no gain all the way though actually lose the yard back to the forty bring up second down an eleven with eight twenty to go in the second quarter\nBig time penetration up front that time for the defense of line and a linebacker that were coming in on the snap\nJohn rice got a great Bush and jet barber on the left side of our defense and\nSort of yours Neal will send the one receiver y the last one to the right to back to the backfield now with the quarterback Tom as soon as shotgun formation [noise]\nTo keep it after the little a sweepstake and cut it up with the forty check it out to the forty three are lined he'll take a camera shot there I Believe had been white I let him up at the forty three yards law did bring up or down on seven now for ws Neal was a\nBelly the belly soup like settling down on them right there and put 'em on his back a great play\nComing from is free free safety position they shake the hand off sweetened the quarterback kept it off the left side and\nJust got a couple on the plane could tackle seven twenty five to go here humans right leading fourteen to nothing [noise]\nField looks in great shape tonight is a beautiful night sixty degree weather\nFinally some fall whether it's like you're in West Virginia and you know it was too cold up there last night\n... are out there some to the receiver on the left side it's complete to number eleven Jennings Hobbs but you only make it to the forty nine yard line that will be two yards shorter first down so uncertain seven again they throw for maybe five yard route Harris feeling to tackle for the bulldogs and will hold him to a short of the ... first down\nAnd that's the third or fourth time they Fronteras inside with some success but man he is he doing a great job in coverage there are no yards after the catch and again they're short first down so mission accomplished\nPlus they will go for it yeah I don't blame them down fourteen to nothing so forced into now left that tight in and went back to the left they'll give it to the running back around the left side he's got plenty of room across the fifty down inside the forty five\nAnd he'll run out he'll be running out of bounds that was number six among Craig on the hand off around the left side they kinda overloaded that to the left side with the wind got to spend in there and he takes it down to the forty one view of a mess right so the deepest penetration of the night for ws Neal first intended to do at the U. S. right forty one\nYou know the numbers on that left side and did a great job of blocking it up and ran with some heart turned it up and got some speed going and picked up first down first time there and build on territory [noise]\nSix five to go here and the second quarter ws Neal since two receivers why did the right\nThey'll give it to the full back off the left side that is joke Carol takes it inside the forty goals is way down to the thirty six or we again of five on the plane and bring up sucking down and five for the blue eagles with five fifty to go here in the second quarter [noise] just odd\nTo see that many a red shirts on the ground as he runs fine yeah I usually were able to\nMaintain those blocks up front and not able to do so in the last two plays [noise]\nGetting the tight end annoying to the left side for ws Neal one receiver to the right to back to the backfield the quarterback will play action wrote to his right he's going to stop and look down the middle of the field he's going to try to hit a post routes\nDeep in the end zone and it'll be in ... awesome festival and they're going to throw a flag on it but why does he turned around and try to catch up with a receiver who was behind Harris few down in the middle of the field they're going to call in for interference in\nThem I mean he he did run into him and he did knocking down before the ball went over his head but to have all ended three yards out the\nBack of the end zone has completely uncomfortable\nNonetheless they're going to give it to him [noise]\nSo to Fifteen yard penalty will be a first down for WSBIU and take the ball down to the Twenty one yard line of you almost right so\nSome penetration now by the by the blue eagles and I'm with five Fifteen to go in the second quarter they're threatening to put a score on the board here against the bulldog defense who've been pitch and shut out for quite a number of course [noise]\nTwo receivers come why do the right side and went to the left\nInside hand off again on the counter play they're going to cut it up inside the twenty take it down inside the fifteenth so that's a wing back counter to number twenty would areas Harrison he'll take it down to the fourteen yard line so seven your gain on first down on the little inside talent\nBorn and raised locally the principles of a ... year old graduate from you I'm not sure I\nFound

with those bags and and we get off that van that the teams look at us and they know that they've got competition yeah absolutely\nAnd talk a little bit about your schedule now or you had to change the few things up but I think you you play a really good schedule the kids get to travel a lot of different play play like great golf course we do we do we\nYou know we play the Bradley Johnson which is kind of the the pinnacle of the high school in Alabama a great country called in Birmingham just phenomenal that was the senior tour vent their replace Joe King in Auburn University club one of the best golf courses I think in my opinion I think\nIt's one of the hidden ... I think it's a secret I think it is an awesome awesome golf course I couldn't agree more that the only problem with it is we always play in early March and the conditions are never very good I'd love to go play only last July sometime dry and the ball rolling like crazy but it's probably made surely hard but I didn't or up to the now do you\nFind um we used to play you know call me Tuscaloosa which is a favorite of the kids but they've gone through her coaching change so they've kind of taking that went out for a year of their own hide west Alabama terminal damned classic why all golf tournament\nUm we are returning to the blue grain Montgomery this year because we are going to go play practice Ronald ... there were state will be so not getting ahead of ourselves but it's always good to\nBe covered um\nAnd then we hosted couple are we have our event here right the David Milam memorial we've we've actually moved it from the traditional spot and end of April we moved it up to

[laughter]\nAnd you must write will get the ball to start the second half we want to toss and deferred so hopefully we can get bogged down put some points on the board so a couple of other stats from the first half really I'm\nJust trying to see a key shot to catch his for thirty three yards he's been skippers go to guy here\nAre throwing the ball on his show to completion since uh I think that

actually true I didn't grow up in ... ban and\nI'm as a matter of fact typically before the Auburn game a um\nThis happened last year [noise]\nWay here till after the play\nBulldogs are going to try to run a tall sweet brown the left side that place had known that play I Know where to go there was penetration up in the backfield in a\nSprint skip returned to toss it there was actually a defender standing there Simon caught a tried to cut it up and Saudi loses a couple it'll take it back to the Nineteen yard line would bring up forced out of ten now for your mess right from the ws Neal Eighteen yard my so you're getting ready to yeah Scott\nCochran started running around the locker room and said where's doc wears dark I raised my hand he'd say who did you used to pull for us that I grew up in Auburn fan he said what color you are now and I said I'm wearing ... everybody started giving me a hard time they all know that I grew up in all their head when you build a relationship that I have that\nIt is not is not a hard transition in a grown to grown to love and\nAnd be a big part of the\nAs a field goal pushing the person who's going to attack we bring the ... the field goal in unity of willpower she's going to attempt that was actually a thirty five yard field goal attempts any books at just a little left plenty of leg\nYeah there's plenty of leg hooks let there is a little wind blowing out there that I don't know if that affected are not as well like the ... the fly down here and so the bulldogs will take it all the way down to the Nineteen twenty you are a lot of ws Neal come away with no points here to start the third quarter really kind of what we're talking about it have to Michael we would come up with some points on the board and kind of put this went away\nBut it's in our states fourteen to nothing ws Neal takes over first in ten from their own twenty\nThey come out again and the tea form racial tied in in a way to the right quarterback up under center to backs in the backfield they'll give it to the second back that's among Craig around the right side cuts it up to twenty and he'll get four out to the twenty four yard line that'll bring up second down and six talk a little bit about the festivities today and and and uh what\nIt was like to be inducted into the human is right up like all say\nWell it's a real honor on honestly it's is very humbling to be a to be selected to be a member of the hall of fame misses the school's been around for a hundred and twenty five years and to to get inducted with the\nFive other people today was was really special and and\nIt's nice to nice to\nBe honored is an individual but [noise]\nFor me it's really more about\nThe team that I played on like Moore says the miserable I was lucky enough to play and the only state basketball championship one here you have and that that's really what it's more about movies and the [noise]\nSecondary run play for ws Neal off the right side and that's maybe two it'll bring up third down here to see if the bulldog defense can get a stop certain three now for the Neal\nWho he goes from their own twenty seven yard line also two receivers why the left tied in with him to the right to give it to the running back off the right side and each little crazed\nTakes it right to to thirty yard line he gets stood up I think they're going to give it to him driven by those who are going to give him the first astronaut sons who was it made the first contact there that was Richard Branson in there along with a\nBelieve Tyler urban but they give him right out the thirty yard line that will be enough for a first down for ws Neal here on their first Rob of the second half seven thirty eight to go in the third quarter you a mess right leaning fourteen it up and over the ws Neal Blue eagles and I I kinda have to chuckle when I say that that was my high school on them for my high schools\nMascot we were the ...

[noise]\nI guess Neal has great deals assertion [noise]\nPassion we quarterback he's going to try to voters right he's got some rooms\nAccidents to twenty and John rice will take him down along with it and why is it the Nineteen yard line but [noise] uh no I don't want to thank you for joining us here at the end the booze appreciate you coming up and congratulations on being inducted into

from the uh [noise] two thousand and Eighteen at the end of the end of the most right that's what I call the same percentage of spending the third quarter with this and talking a little bit about so\nI bet easier some things on the sidelines of Alabama so here's the handoff sweep around the left side this time it's going to go to um on credit for do yes Neal good job there by the bulldogs to trace that one down hold him to maybe a yard or to game\nUpsurge down into now for ws Neal from you'll mess right Eighteen yard line ws Neal's having success run into football and all that in this game is getting short and down very quickly possessions or well are becoming rare and\nMaybe more surprisingly I mean you Todd is we're not having excess run on the phone from a couple of burst pastime and how we we've actually disasters and like\nSo here we go down now for ws Neal they're gonna run to fall back on the left side he'll cut it out for\nThe Seventy and they don't get to the sixteen and let's see where they're going to marketing that we had some penetration over there I Believe Tyler everyone's going to stand up with a sixteen your lawn and that will be shorter the first sale bring up forced them on now for the illegal and they said\nConverted several forced downside against our deep and [noise] they're just\nGoing after the fall back into care or we'd go on one seventies afraid [noise] um [noise]\nStay in their basic needs to [noise] in way into the lab for obvious Neal force in on the receivers ride to the right [noise]\nMe [noise] gotta quarterback or Mathew\nThomas takes straight up the mentally ill get inside the twenty down to the Nineteen and that'll be up to your game but enough for a first down for W s Neal was nine forty five to go here and the ball game [noise]\nThey are very inspired you know and [noise]\nBelieving they can get back in this ball game right now whereas [noise]\nLotta Friday nights we you've taken the will out of a team [noise] not the case with the blue eagle [noise]\nSoviet Neal came to vote tonight one in six on the season there [noise] controlling the control in the earlier in the second half so first in ten years to fall back on the trap like your job somebody got her cycle Sarah I Believe that one step Davis\nWho was able to grab a man and bring it down at the ten yards law but not before games three yards though you know bring up second down in seven from that you'll notice right ten [noise]\nAnd they are\nAble to get a first down inside the five and about this for your line and they're certainly afford Alan territory is our defense has\nQuite the job cut out for them right now\nAnd we felt so far uh fourteen enough in our school and was nine minutes to go on the ball game and wings of the left to blacks in the backfield\nHere says the quarterback and you're trying to\nWhat's like your coverage for you a mess right at their own age you are blind so great job by the bulldog defense to hit that bad [noise] out of the quarterback stands a knock at four\nAnd it is a problem when they were talking about whether they thought it was a pass I think having a little jab actually locked out of his hands yeah west for annual match right recovered it for a that's our second\nAs a big time play 'cause you just you just start like if they stuck down there and we we have a real big fight on their hands and now that we can really short and this game or two scores even though we are in the Neal's going to take a timeout now talk\nTo they're going to take their second time out of the half already with eight forty eight to go here and the ball game you don't mess right leaning fourteen denouncing in it is a that's our second turnover of the night for the defense we've got an interception earlier and and that's a form of recovery and [noise]\nThe takeover first intense from their own yard line it's good to have Norman here in the group was this I didn't go to a break

Halloween Halloween is a holiday that some of us think of as um you know for kids where do you come down on this issue\nOr it's not only for kids\nIs it a holiday for kids or should adults dress up I'm going to be getting into a whole sexy costume conversation coming up here a few minutes and I don't even know where you come down on this issue should adults we dressing up for Halloween\n[laughter] ah well I mean Jeff I there's been a major issues in the new fight problematic ... I think back and Kelly had a call on this week about a essentially defending\nIt must be defending black me I don't want to do but she just doesn't have a job anymore she has ... million dollars or bank so that you're heard me my guess would be fired by NBC and to get Seventy million dollars or so um but yeah\nI I don't I don't remember the problem here are dressed up as Brett Kavanaugh her ... and I'm going to wear a ... I got just outfit and I'm Out of gas or an imam signer on ...
