I can tell you having watched the interview shoes and she's a liar because she changed her statement from what the official statement was you don't get to go from oh I I was born declaration saying that Brett Kavanaugh spiked punch at a party and then say well he was standing next to the punch it might have spiked\nI don't know if any do saw or how many of you saw the Jewish wedding interviews aired on NBC NBC which also we may get to later has\nVarious versions of an untrue story trying to say that Kavanaugh was causing problems about the Ramirez testimony just the second woman didn't testify just give us warns name but the ... allegation\nBut hold that thought for a moment sweat Nick\nIs the one who says the Kavanaugh was president for gang rapes and that there were gang rape parties in the DC area sweat it also well I'll break down all of the reasons why she's\nI don't think she's mistaken Dr Ford may be a mistake and I think she's a very troubled woman\nI think that she has a lot of issues and I think that she may which she makes clear by telling us and she's got as she she just happens to blame her she was on Brett Kavanaugh but I think Jews issues completely apart from Kevin ... but she may very well believe what she said and as I've told you hear\nI Witness testimony leads to a lot of innocent people go into prison with his testimony can be very problematic on its own\nUm but sweat Nick is not confused sweat Nick is not somebody who just is\nTo be ... and and might be making a mistake that's destroying someone's life\nHere's just a part of the kind of things that she was saying this interview and then and then I'll tell you why I Know that she's lying and then we have to evaluate well if the third person that the media treated as serious and said oh gosh this needs to be investigated if she's a liar\nDo we get to look at the second person who also has a shady story and say you know maybe there's a pattern here maybe all of these leftist females who are coming forward\nAt a moment of peril for roe v Wade maybe they're doing it for political reasons ... where we're not supposed to have that conversation bowl I Want to have that conversation\nDemands life his reputation his honor his dignity hand in the balance hang in the balance and day a Supreme Court seat hangs in the balance as well\n\nHere's some of the sweat Nick interview that aired yesterday play to\nWhat he said well I'll tell what happened when it happened to me I didn't put ten and I gather that\nI have boys outside and we're congregated together so like I dont lead [noise] and I didn't know what was that correct a valid point ... a lot of laughing I'm\nFalling in line outside or wind that definitely huddled by door I oh I didn't understand what it could possibly day\nAnd the ... anyone to get their way they're watching out numbered\nIn our whole and farm outside the door\nOne thing that I Would say ... to have [noise]\nI I have called cattle\nOr are they read something pop and really audio that we we got we have crossed wires there for a second but ... heard sweat next talking let's not look at what she says I don't know trying to play the ... minute interview it's not worth it because he's just a liar I I can tell you what you lying about\nShe's saying that she thinks that there were gang rapes are she's making the allegation that there were a gang rapes going all these parties because there were boys huddled outside of rooms\nAs she ever been to a party with teenagers were drinking beer they all huddled together has she ever been to a party were teenagers are you do have a drink seven fondue whatever they're doing they clump in little groups all over the place I remember this I used to be cool I used to go to parties\nThere's nothing about what she says it makes it as a game if she claims that she was raped and I'll I'll put that whole that whole conversation aside I Would note she hasn't named anybody that she thinks rape her\nOther than Kavanaugh who she says she thinks raped her how could you how could you sleep at night saying that somebody might have rape you when you don't know\nHow could you do that\nShe doesn't know I assume that means that she either blacked out or she's claimed that she was drugged but then why is he bringing his name what makes her think that he was involved if she doesn't know he was involved you see what I'm saying it doesn't make any sense\nWhy is his name even coming up then because he happened to be at this party by the way I don't believe she never even saw him at these parties I think this whole thing is a complete and utter I Know\nThis is a fabrication now does she pepper and some details here or there about it she she from the area did she go to a party at some point I mean she can claim that some of this stuff might be but it's\nTrue in Vegas and certainly not true in a criminal sense she went from saying in this interview that Kavanaugh spike the punch which how would that work\nHe spikes the punch everyone's drinking from that okay so he wants to get the girls drunk she sang right so you can take advantage of that means but that means everybody's getting really drunk or high school kids it's not like the guys can be drinking this up you know is adding a little adding a little boost to it to make it a little stiffer\nOkay they're drinking punch so they can do that he can't roof the the big bowl of punch cars that means you'd be roofing himself and all these other guys and girls that everybody right it'd be like poisoning the only water source you have well if you drink from that too it's a bad idea ... story is idiotic\nDoesn't make any sense\nFabrication that that's why that's why when you get into the details at least doctor former smart to say I don't remember I don't remember all I Know is that he did this she doesn't really remember anything other than Brett Kavanaugh did this that's all she remembers\nThis woman tried to do all this other stuff but the story was too complicated and she can't keep it straight\nShe claims that they would show up wearing their high school uniform they're Catholic school uniform to these parties now now they do\nI went to a a Catholic school or private school in Manhattan we used to parties and parents were gone and we drink beer and not really kegs but you know we'd get into all kinds of booze people weren't showing up wearing their uniforms that's just weird and she added that detail to make it seem authentic but that's that's wrong that doesn't ring true\nAnother detail that came up in the course of this never mind the fact that as I as I've already said she's changed things from her sworn statement\nShe is telling details are telling us details that don't make sense she's saying that Brett Kavanaugh maybe kinda she's not sure raped her which is not something that a person who really believe they were raped by this person would ever say\nShe also graduated a few years ahead of cabinet she's parties at Fifteen and sixteen year old high school parties no no I'm not saying it never happens but people in college don't go to the the high school parties with sophomores in high school that doesn't happen\nI was in college not long ago that would be considered strange\nAnd she's the adult these are high school can I can tell you this when I was in college I Know that every female that I was friends with that my college if they were at a party of high school kids and they thought the girls are being roof eat and raped gang raped\nThey call the police right away right away you got to remember there's a power dynamic here right a a twenty two year old has a lot more maturity and\nWe'd be in a much stronger position to take action or would feel much stronger position socially when the party of no Fifteen and sixteen year olds\nI coached high school soccer I was twenty two and my kids were Fifteen or sixteen and they thought I was the adult and they were a bunch of kids I wasn't going out doing keg stands with them is just on the point is it doesn't make sense she's lying\nIn an interview she gave was obvious it was a disaster anyone is still believes this really turned into an intelligence test\nBecause you can't J. O. know emotionally I'm really connected to her no she's a liar so if you're not smart enough to figure that out I don't know what to say\nTwo thoughts on this and then when we got we got so much more to the Senate Democrats are they're scrambling to keep this whole thing a lot because they know they know now they've mortgage all their credibility all their decency they've acted like total scum to try to stop gap and all they know this\nMany Amazon employees can look forward to a bigger paychecks a month from now the online retailer will raise the minimum wage for all of its American workers to Fifteen dollars an hour as the November first that will apply to all current employees and to the more than one hundred thousand seasonal workers who will come aboard for the holidays\nHome prices increased in August core logic reports prices were up five and a half percent from August of last year they're projected to be up another four point seven percent by next August\nIt's possible Toys R us could be back in some foreign lenders to control the chains assets indication of bankruptcy court filing they no longer plan to auction off the intellectual property they plan to reorganize into a new company Jeff ...

conservative everybody\nLoves to bash on conservatives oh gosh makes you the hero of a lot of cocktail parties really does\nBut I think that you might see flake vote no regardless of how that shakes out and so then it comes down to Collins and Murkowski\nCollins and Murkowski Murkowski no votes I think ... realizes that she's done in the Senate if she votes now she's done that's my impression and that's my analysis I could be wrong Murkowski\nThough strikes me is more transactional rent or Murkowski is a little more whatever's good for her forget about the Republican Party forget about whatever principle she's a spouse in the past\nSo\nThat's that's part of my concern ... and then you also have this is continuing narrative in this ties into\nWhat I think is they're trying to build an escape hatch for flake you see they can't get Kevin on the rate they can't convince any normal reasonable person the capital was of all the gang rapes or that or that there's any evidence for any of this because there is no evidence\nBut you've got to remember then there's the Mazie Hirono senator Geraldo from Hawaii there's the approach that she has which is just whatever we can do to\nCriticize this guy to take him down a peg to make him look small after we should do whatever we can investigate about him we should investigate IRS Mazie Hirono on the ice throwing allegations play twenty\nI Can't I Want to ask you about these developments we found out overnight and leave the Donald ... cabin on through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just qualifying for someone who's in a Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is why we need in the eye of the nation because there are a lot of allegations reports really are about how he behaves claiming Trump\nSo that is very relevant and trail of himself as actively choir boy\nOr is there much contradicted by them may find sampling college is on the river and and I go why we need an FBI and the reason why I'm calling from one for like ... ...\nMonths what\nI Do think that there's a strong case to be made that center heroes the dumbest woman or man in the Senate I think she's the dumbest human being in the Senate that's a very that seems to me to be a strong case right now the evidence for that is clear\nWe need an FBI investigation that cab and all because you might have thrown ice into someone's face during a bar fight Thirty years ago\nThirty five years ago who can say that and not feel like a moron really\nDon't don't allow yourself to assume even for a second well she's on TV she's a senator she can't be that she can't be that silly right maybe maybe I'm being harsher no you're not being harsh on our\nTotal embezzle total and complete a missile but\nThis story about temperament on the line about the reason that that\nTalking point is something that I Am analyze it for you there on the show\nIs because that's not going to convince anybody you you got people that hate Kavanaugh or because you know he's a white male white male privilege and it was a front row and he's and he's conservative and overturn roe all that stuff and you can people that say no I'm actually a constitutional is and also I Believe the rule of law\nYeah that's our team\nNo one's going to change their mind about this guy based upon the alleged ice throwing into incident of Nineteen eighty four or whatever it was no that's not serious New York times during a peace right now\nOn how he was part of a\nLike party planning or something back in the day and in New York Times doing that pays whoa oh gosh and he was a college kid I mean they're they're adjudicating his beer drinking\nAnd his social life and social habits from college when he's uh fifty something year old man this is what the New York times has been reduced to joke a disgrace times also had Emily Babylon reporting on Kavanaugh as a quote reporter when in July before any this happened she came out and said she opposes him because of the threat that he poses\nTo civil rights and women's rights I'm short too of course that's that's that's a given you can assume that\nLook by creating the storyline of temperament and oh he's a he's a belligerent drunk he was mean he's a bad guy that's not for any normal person to change their mind one way or the other than that it's\nAll about getting an escape hatch for flight and maybe Murkowski\nOh we don't want to look let's put forward we agree both lakes word is good for nothing I mean he could come out today and say I guarantee you I Would vote for capping off this has done and we don't have any more derogatory information I still wouldn't believe\nUntil the votes happened we do know guys a coward an absolute wet noodle spine coward\nBut if they can open this story line you see how it goes oh we need somebody who's a more bipartisan pick this whole process has been tainted the country's two divided right now\nSo in response to the left waging an unprecedented part as an assault on cabin on all of his supporters and and all those around them and the entire system and all the women dressed in The Handmaid's tale costumes and putting anatomically correct female body parts on their heads as hats and all the stuff that they're doing all that\nFlake takes the position of\nOh well we should have now and give them what they want in the spirit of bipartisanship that's what I think's gone up happening I think flakes gonna be a no vote at the end of this whole thing knowing that yes you'll receive a lot of\nViciousness from Washington viciousness a lot of anger it's not vicious it's completely warranted legitimate justice really from\nPeople but he's playing the long game of I Want to get a book a book deal from Simon and Schuster or whomever you know a big big big\nHouse that's that's what flakes game is year\nOr so that's why I'm I'm concerned I I don't know how the votes will go I'm not I have zero confidence and the ability of Republicans in this case to do what's right one thing that just that just got released and I I wasn't sure I I'm not going to redo from it\nBecause it is salacious\nThat you could definitely say it is it is a salacious document sort of like the salacious dusty a but it did I I have noticed All right I ... I have noticed this I I Am aware of it\nAnd\nIt's the Senate Judiciary committee they released a statement from somebody that I think kind of romantic linked to sweat Nick and man oh man or their things in there since we telling you that sweating it gives a very disturbed and sexually\nI don't even know what the word would be you'd have to read the document I Can't read it on their family show there's some really intense stuff in there though bottom line is the woman is crazy that's that's the bottom line\nOr and that her allegations should not be taken seriously and and you know they they they posted up some activists in Reagan Airport I see this and and they're trying to harass other Republican senators in there now and I heard\nThis line you know how many women have to be assaulted before you believe women\nDish is a this is a\nFundamental problem with the whole left wing approach you're eight eight collective\nVersion of justice or a collective is to approach to justice that's at the heart of all this I Want to address that when we come back and then we'll talk about the mid germs and where I think this is going in terms of red wave blue wave all that stuff third our going into the economy and\nFederal Reserve chairman Jay Powell says the American economy is experiencing a bright moment and the outlook is positive\nPeninsula remaining below four percent for an extended period with inflation studying here to ... and I made the cases forecast is not to run to be true how well\nSpoken Boston to members of the national association for business economics the Chrysler posted September sales the top ... sales at Ford fell short forecast last month General Motors reported its third quarter sales were down eleven percent from the prior third quarter\n... produced more than eighty thousand vehicles and the third quarter of that total more than fifty three thousand were model three so bans Jeff ...

wave ... isn't that in\nSitting Republican wave is it possible folks that just as we saw on twenty sixteen the geo pie in the era of Trump could greatly defied the experts in the expectations in this upcoming election\nI don't want to get your hopes up and I I kinda want everybody listening to this to be fired up\nAnd be mad mad people people who are or annoyed about what's going on they're\nLikely or to show up and vote people that are happy to get a little complacent you know with the status quo they figure out things are good things will stay good well what are you seeing in the cabinet debacle is that Democrats cannot be trusted with power you can't have these people in charge you can't do it\nHave to stop them from being able to set the government agenda will be a bad thing for all of us so I don't want anyone to lose sight of that but the truth is nobody really knows what's gonna happen right now with the election the truth is that\nIt could go either way and we're over a month out from election right our way of my as my date yeah oh no yeah month and a couple of days over a month out from election day\nSenate and this is where everyone starts saying the same thing it's an eternity in politics Bob well Jill it all comes down to turn out you know\nLobby blah all the same stuff a lot of political pundits present and telling the same thing as people keep asking me I I don't I don't know I certainly hope they're probably going to win but and you know what they're probably going to win it's not like I think the world's going to be a perfect place we don't have any problems anymore because\nPolitics is interesting it's about human interaction and a way of resolving conflict between people in a way of joining together to do\nSome things that makes sense for all of us right but at the end of the day it doesn't determine who you are what your value is that this is the problem with the Democrats left they get show personally wrapped up in\nHer party and all that stuff I mean I I'm wrapped up in principles of their ideas that really matter to me or you know justice and truth and these things that it sounds like I'm giving a speech to be high school president or something but that you know those things matter to me\nI think the geo peas doing a good job of the country they should stay in power because they have been doing a good job\n... not not beyond reproach but yeah there's some very very positive things that are happening that that's one point I wanted to make your in terms of what we've seen with Kavanaugh I Can't say what the reaction is going to be because until you see the reaction then then you\nSee the reaction you're not in a position to really assess whether it's going to have an impact I have a cat or doesn't get through Republicans better send a message for the good of the country better send a message that\nThis will not stand this aggression dude will not stand that's what has\nTo be said and that means preventing Democrats I'm taking the house Democrats take the house it's going to turn into\nOne long endless investigation and impeachment fight that's the only thing that's going to be out there that's the only thing that the Democrats are really going to focus on there's no ... no policy agenda they are going to agree on\nWe'll talk later about who they think they're going to run for the presidency but we're a month out from election day and I have to say this week which is hopefully going to come to a close with Kavanaugh's confirmation but if it doesn't have that could be the difference maker in the midterms I don't believe\nThis other side of it I think that this is wishful thinking and the Democrats than women will turn out in huge numbers of Kavanaugh gets on the Supreme Court I think the only women who really believe the capital is a bad guy and a Kevin Jose you know a predator and that and that you know women should be believed all that stuff all that clock trap rhetoric that you hear\nAre the women who really take that to heart and are mobilized to vote as a result of it have Kavanaugh anyway this is like all the senators are saying oh it does we need to have you back beyond us occasion and that'll decide well you decided before\nAny there's even if you decided before the hearings happened to you know Coons and find sign that we're never going to vote for this guy\nIs all this is all the charade it's all ...

information you want them listen to news radio seven than doubled un GM ... radio [noise]\nEspecially if you're a what the person is doing is more difficult thing to do usually whenever anybody asks me what's going to happen in Washington I'll say my general prediction about politicians is what's the easiest thing for them to do 'cause that's what they're going to do a this was not the easiest thing for\nPlace to do the easiest thing for me to do would be just a vote for a cabin on to get him out of committee and that's the end of that but he held his vote ransom as it were basically saying you can have my vote but we need a week to do this FBI investigation and that folks whether or not you agree with it that was a gutsy thing to do it because it made every Republican in the Senate mad at him\nTemper is the most overrated thinker in the news business I Would wager he's entirely wrong here with his analysis on\nThese Steven cold there show that's absolutely wrong it is the opposite what Jeff Flake did the flake out as it were is the opposite of courage because flake had already said earlier that day that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nThe reason he did not was that he could not take the heat\nThat's not courage that is actually the opposite of Kurds that is called cowardice but notice how this spring\nThey're trying to you and this is very oh chopper very stylish and news media they want all the little senators that are still in the mix they want everybody who is perhaps persuadable on this one when you get to the final vote process\nThey want everyone to know that you know the ones who are going to stop this process or the brave ones let me tell you what Jeff lakes calculation was Jeff Flake really really wants to be liked\nBy CNN by the New York times it's adoptive these are powerful cultural institutions and especially if you're no longer going to be a politician you want in your day to day life to be thought of well by people who have large megaphones who have cultural influence and also by the way\nCan pay you a whole lot of money to do a whole lot of different things that's what you want\nThat's what the self interested person is going to be concern with first and foremost\nLike didn't show courage the harder thing to do he knows this is a scam he's not a complete moron and he knows\nThat if he were to have gone along and do the right thing he would be in tremendous hot water right now with the left with the media so what did he do try to create an alibi for himself\nI'm Still not convinced that he will vote for Kavanaugh but I Would note that even if he does vote for Kavanaugh flake thinks that he's going to be the Republican in this process who when he wants to give fancy speeches in Aspen\nOr East Hampton or wherever when he wants to be among the lead again and treated like somebody that they can stand from the right you know that they can kind of accept him\nHe will say oh well I was the one that got the one week extension I was the one that made sure that there was a step beyond ... investigation which as we now she is a sham it was always going to be a sham inflate knew it was a chef\nSo what's it like do why did he do it self interest which is the opposite of courage\nCowardice because he felt like he had been cornered by those women including a store arose funded active if you can't even make this stuff up\nYelled at him and so he decided to make a different call that day than what he had already said in the morning same day like is a self interest empowered in this whole process and that won't change even if you vote for cabin on the ad because what he's doing is just created additional risk\nFor a man in this case judge Kavanaugh who has been ambushed who has been smeared who has been wind\nIf you're a person of honor and integrity you don't allow that to continue when it's in your power to stop it that's what Jake Tapper doesn't understand apparently it's what Jake Tapper does know yeah there was a hard thing for me do it was a hard thing for him to do for the few days but he'll get criticism from the right\nIt's much easier thing for him to do for the rest of his life when he's going to want to be at the country club or he's going to want to go and get a contributor ship at MSNBC or CNN or ABC and he'll say I'm the Republican who broke ranks in order to try and defend\nOr what does the process of getting an FBI investigation was total and complete garbage ... choppers got an entirely wrong that's not surprising you know top are always on the on the cold

enough oh he he didn't he didn't really manage something that's as good as\nYou're being told that is of course told that his by people like me in a a bunch of others but not the mainstream media not the overwhelming\nNumber of media outlets out there they're so invested in telling you that Trump is a bumbling the food that he can't do anything right that he's terrible in negotiation that he has no idea what he's doing this is what they'll tell you\nI'm this doesn't swear at the reality though and you know I'm I'm Out here in this this conference a which stands for research some of you know them 'cause I Do a podcast with their with their founder and chairman and stands for it's a it's a great\nGroup I learned a lot about investing in finance from them I really enjoy working with them but\nThey bring out all these experts experts on trade and crypto currency and investing and all kinds of things I Would just a whole slew of its three days of a world class experts in speakers I brought my buddy Sean Parnell out\nThis year showing that a great job if you ever get a chance to er here Shawn tell the first major enemy contact you had in Afghanistan maybe we'll have him come on and tell us that story as kind of fun I'll\nI'll sit back with all you and just relax kick off my feet on the desk oh Sean Scott story time for us\nBut I'm speaking to all these different people who are\nVery involved in the markets economy and they have to be right now that's one thing you get a lot of these people go on TV are all going to call to most of the country the Mummers oh this is what Paul Krugman says\nI'm Talking about people that have to be right because of where they're putting their money where they're investing what they're doing and even the ones that were very skeptical at Trump and there's a lot of Trump skeptics out here that I'm Talking to\nYou will just capital Trump or saying you can't disregard the results and that's what people want to do I'm not even saying you know you're not allowed to argue that the results aren't as good as people say fine you know people want to quibble over how good the results have been and that's one thing\nBut you can't just regard them you can say oh the economy is amazing but it's not Trump that did this or Trump doesn't get any credit for this that's just\nThat's being unreasonable that's not looking at the evidence and making\nDecisions based on what's\nWell making coming to conclusions based on what's really happening here or there and there's some other stuff and I know has been said about Trump in the last day or so you had to a union leader a union leader no less thanking Trump for tax breaks play Thirteen\nThanks to Mr ... tax reforms and general confidence in the economy I guess we have really been able to invest more in our employees and for our company and the last year for investing more in\nAnd play wages\nAnd ... and ... says we're spending billions on Clinton and I said and\nAnd Central Asia thing a huge increase in and work coming out because the attorneys are spending more to update\nThe aging infrastructure\nSo thank you very and I made a huge impact\nLooking to grow about ah twenty or thirty percent more and places and the next few months we had a lot of large projects that are starting and I will make I think a big difference and really it is and ... that are good for businesses are really important for our employees also the communities we work at it and leave [laughter]\nReally than thankful and had the ... President Trump for an office\nSo that's a union leader telling you what the tax break has meant for the union that she represents for the employees that people showing up trying to earn a living trying to pay their mortgage feed their families and all this positive stuff she's saying you're you get that message elsewhere\nIt's not rocket science folks if you have more money if your business has to give less of the money that it makes if you have to have less of your property taken from you by the government venue or in a better position\nTo invest to pay people more to grow to compete this is\nIt's so straightforward isn't it Democrats come up with all these convoluted theories about oh no we need a higher tax for why should we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world why does that make sense someone explain that to me because we get the best government services for our business is that's a laugh\nAnd it's not even just the tax breaks that have resulted in so many benefits and and so much good stuff going on and there's also the regulatory environment change which I I ... I'm ... I'm speaking I'm going to play some more some more uh\nAnother soundbite here for you from a small business owner of the Trump rally but I'm Talking to a small business owners just for for days I'm Out here in Vegas for three days\nViva la ... I'm Out here for three days and I'm Talking to all these different people from industry and and corporate America and even the ones you don't like Trump style or don't align with them on all of his policies they're saying what he is doing is working what Obama was doing before was bad\nIt makes it harder for businesses when you think that growing massive government program spending more money on entitlements a trillion dollar stimulus gave away a left wing interest when you think that's the most productive way to use capital you're wrong bad things happen when you let the business of the American people be business to borrow from Calvin Coolidge\nGood things can happen and that also means de regulating and here's one of the uh the gene or not he had these small business rally the Trump pattern at the rally he's a small business owner played fourteen\nFirst I'd like to uh think President Trump for helping us with his fiscal policy which have enabled my company Arcadia electric [noise]\nTibet on more work [noise]\nAnd uh take on more jobs um that were able to do now because we have more coming um that's available to us\nA more than ever before and\nUm we have been able to\nKeep our a hundred and twenty people employed but next year we anticipate higher in twenty five percent\nMore a hardworking union workers middle class um works for us I think the president of the United states for his perseverance and uh [noise] for us to get this work [noise]\nAnd um [noise] to change the regulatory policies that he's been doing that he spoke of earlier this is all health food to us so President Trump\nMight think\nWell what is the what is the counterpoint to this really we're going to hear in a few minutes we'll talk about how lives with war and like I needed that country around\nMy warning my Hillary impression are very similar because I find them very similar even though they're I guess pretty different\nWe turned the country around you said earlier that we've got that\nAnd for you Sharon how make it worse make us more poor\nTurn around there's wealth creation turned around the investment in the job creation that that's where we are in ...\nThis is what you get from left or even when things are going well even things that they hate things that work if it is ideologically not working because of what they said right ... if it goes against their ideology that it doesn't matter that it's bringing all kinds of benefits to people and doing all sorts of good stuff so\nI I got to say I'm hearing it from the horse's mouth so to speak lots of

doesn't have the skills and I think that she's also already really been marginalized by building a career based on racial fraud that's what she did\nShe became a senator because she was a Harvard law professor she became a Harvard law professor because she claimed that she was a Native American on an application there now I Would say that I'm actually\nIn favor of doing that meaning I'm In favor

I'm about\nTwo percent according to my brother's ancestry DNA I think I'm two percent so could I claim Native American status I'm I'm not exactly sure I don't I don't know but it's worth a shot\nBut I don't think Warren speaking of a shot I don't think warns got a shot\nAnd the fact that she's even talking about this for twenty twenty just goes to show you wow Democrats have a very weak bench right now also this notion that she needs to turn the country around and I I keep returning to this notion to this point because I I have to tell you I'm I'm sitting here and I keep saying to myself\nWhat exactly is the Democrats hate so much about what's happening around us well what is really their objection again we're not starting wars in countries we don't need to be at war and we don't have some you know we don't we don't have the worst thing happened in this country right now so crazy the Democrats are it's just the truth\nThere's nothing that's going on right now that you say to yourself oh my gosh this doesn't stop I don't know what's gonna happen I don't know what kind of shape are going to be a no that's that's not reality\nReality is that overall the country is doing quite well over all the country is on a very solid trajectory and you could say it's\n... it's the strongest economy certainly since the year two thousand so it almost twenty or some people just wrong as economy more like forty or fifty years really strong economy so I I have to ask what does she think needs to be turned around exactly the Trump tweets out mean things\nWhat what part of\nWhat she's saying here is based in reality versus what part of this is just demagoguery ... the usual stuff would expect from what\nI did it twice twice when\nShe has no charisma no charm nothing and man people are going to get really testy with all of\nThe mockery that's going to come her way for claiming that they ... you know she's not I live there's nothing there's no I'm not trying to say that being a school's not a good thing but she didn't have the academic pedigree to become a Harvard professor without\nIt sound like it was a close call unless you went to an Ivy League law school and then she wanted to be a professor at Harvard she went to a state school in New Jersey\nNot a particularly you know selective state school again not trying to be a jerk but she used cars and you can get a great education
