Democrats they weren't ever go out and voted through because the senators know had to go back to their states get reelected although I Will get reelected if they support fix last\nOh not a guest I'm I'm Glad they got past but they laid the foundation for legislation through ... back then and they're using it ever since I was a reasonable or they can take care of our own way because it's just a certain point you if you look cream court judges through three more\nAt the very top they're Seventy five years which can work the ocean and how much the youngest several a story that could conceivably go within the next six years that would give Trump or even more because you don't win reelection totally totally\nWell if you base it on the economy and if we think James Carville for it's the economy stupid then yeah the the president stands a real good chance against one of the seven thousand possible democratic candidates who are being talked about to face him\nAnd this would be if Donald Trump get one more this would be a landmark this would be total game changing in terms of moving the court to a more conservative or at the position than anyone could ever\nSee so uh I'm with

about the Russians right right and not doing a thing\nAnd uh we'll also talk about Mike Pence and China that's coming up the bottom and next our with our friend Gordon Chang but I Want to get back to your books it was just a body a week ago\nThe judge Kavanaugh had to face some ridiculous questions from Senator Whitehouse a Democrat who was going through judge Kavanaugh's yearbook to remember some of the ridiculous moments one of them surrounded\nA couple I'm surrounded alcohol but vomiting so first we went with bar thing you're worried about my yearbook\nOver um website look at a beach week Ralph club biggest contributor which is the word Ralph\nMean and that that probably ... to a throwing up on known to have a weak stomach and I always have in fact the last time I see are you asking me about having catch up on spaghetti I always had a weak stomach\nI don't know that I have to catch on spaghetti let you didn't someone did and and this is well known anyone who were\nAsking about catch up on spaghetti this is what's going on in the United States Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about the confirmation but it got weirder than that talking about your books and comments tail off\nAnd\nDid the word Ralph\nYou use our yard is already answered all if you're really taco [noise]\nI like that I like beer I don't know if you don't like beer center or not um what do you watch the ... one is so\nCabinet I got heat for that for that answer for confronting White House or his obsession with a teenager who may have consumed enough beer to bomb it and then the guy we went from ... to boot thing\nOr what do you have a view I don't know if it's books are being asked how do you pronounce that\nShow her first a flash when we were sixteen [laughter] okay [noise]\nThat went on for a while and and they were obsessed with the F word and I'm sure the senator has never heard the F word in his life said this this whole obsession with your books in high school yearbooks got me thinking\nSo what did I Do I die then to the high school yearbooks as some of the people on this committee the Democrats on this committee I went and looked at Richard Blumenthal the named Dick\nThe guy who has a committed stolen valor in my opinion by claiming he was fighting in Vietnam when he wasn't\nHe uh he did serve this country in the marine corps reserves achieving the rank of sergeant\nNo that's not really achieving there are a lot of sergeants I Know who did work hard but\nIf you're going to college and then you're getting in the military they tend to make you an officer right out of the blocks\nSo ... saying that he was serving in Vietnam then had to come back and make it cheerful apology or this guy was a child of privilege was in a private school and are played on the\nTennis team and was on the swim team and then I started looking at Cory Booker Spartacus Spartacus Booker\nWho was a football player in his school and if you look at the end Cory bookers\nSenior pay John on the uh high school yearbook you can see Cory bookers nickname was sugar that's what he was known to the students in his high school sugar\nThat sugar low sugar can we find out what sugar means what does that mean because some people in the eighties referred to cocaine is sugar should we assume that Cory Booker may have been doing drugs because his name was sugar and in his senior year year book quote\nCory Booker has the phrase\nLet's go all the way so what's\nGoing on with Cory Booker what does that mean Cory Booker this is the guy who remember wrote the essay about groping a woman at the age of Fifteen the essay about stealing second amusing air quotes they're\nSo why are we putting the year books of all of the Judiciary Committee people up somewhere why aren't we taking Cory bookers stealing second Cory Booker Spartacus and ask him what does he mean by let's\nGo all the way he was grabbing Fifteen year olds\nAnd emitted to it there's your guy who's admit it there's a guy who corroborate zone damning testimony\nAll right I'm shifting gears sentiment in here you know I Need to tell you about something important as important as the show important to you especially if

the heck you're saying\nZip ties thank you John whispering in my ear zip ties he must be a a veteran of these protests\nSo that that's what happened today in Washington I expect it's going to get bigger and wild there tomorrow I expect we're going to see more protests the more craziness but you know what you're not going to see I Hope you don't see any more of the silliness around judge Kavanaugh's year book and\nFocus on things like the devil's triangle\nWe played Senator Whitehouse mocking Kavanaugh talking about a bar fearing booth failing and the devil's triangle which cabinet insisted was drinking game\nWhite House\nTold them he thought he was lying to them they didn't believe it was a drinking game that he thought that was something nefarious hair\nAnd if you go to the Urban Dictionary which I advise you do not do it at work and you look up the devil's triangle you will see that it is a an some definitions a a ... with two men and one woman\nBut in the era of judge Kavanaugh\nThe devil's triangle was according to some of his classmates who wrote a letter I Am in possession of the letter right here that was sent to chairman Grassley right here right here [noise] got it right here\nDeer chairman Grassley and ranking member Feinstein so went to both of them we're classmates have Brent Kavanaugh says from Georgetown Prep a Jesuit high school in Washington DC area\nWe write to clarify any misunderstanding about the phrase devil's triangle that appeared on our Nineteen eighty three high school yearbook\nIncluding on our individual year book pages\nThat phrase was the subject of questioning a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing last week and has since been discussed in the media oh has it\nThe devil's triangle was drinking game we came up with in high school\nIt was a variation on the game quarters and if you remember judge Kavanaugh said it's a drinking game senator do you know quarters and White House like now I don't know anything about that the letter continues when we played devil's triangle for people sat at a table\nOn the table three small glasses of beer were arranged next to one another to form a triangle each of the four participants took turns being the shooter\nAttempting to bounce a quarter into one of the glasses if the quarter landed in one of the glasses the person at the table using sitting at nearest that glass had to drink the beer\nWe do not remember the exact origins of the name but none of us use the phrase devil's triangle and our yearbook to refer to any kind of sexual activity to us it was just a game\nWith glasses in the shape of a triangle if the phrase devil's triangle had any sexual meaning in the early Nineteen eighties we did not know it sincerely delaying the Davis Bernard McCarthy junior Paul Murray and Matthew Quinn\nThese are four classmates so they sent these letters now if you go into the same year book\nAnd you look up a Bernard McCarthy in McCarthy's yearbook page he also uses the same\nF F F F F F F that\nKavanaugh dead which we know refers to the F word and a friend of theirs who used to quote have a long wind up to it when he would say ...\nAnd ah he references ... another one of their friends and he also claims to be the founder of the devil's triangle\nSo uh I just wish somebody in the Senate which said to these idiots you realize how stupid you'll look when you say stuff like this\n... absolutely insane that this is getting this much attention and Senator Whitehouse is out there saying well\nWell I don't believe you\nSo that means the White House is firmly locked in and believing that there has been a ... between Brett Kavanaugh and another guy and his high school despite what everybody else\nSays demanding I Know\nAnd now the mainstream media is going to jump on a soundbite that came out of justice Paul Stevens' his mouth that ah earlier today surface the Ninety eight year old former Supreme Court justice\nWho had many liberal votes behind him claim to be a lifelong Republican is now saying that he doesn't think Kavanaugh should be on the court I don't care what you think sir you had your term you can sit down now go sell your books

SPAN as geeks like me will do you may have caught this moment\nThe Chinese Communist party is rewarding or coercing American businesses movie studios universities think tanks scholars journalists and local state and federal officials\nAnd worst of all China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion the two thousand Eighteen elections and the environment leading into the twenty twenty presidential elections\nVice president Mike Pence delivering a very serious address about China and what China is trying to do also going on in the background discussions with North Korea over what the next to meetings going to be with\nDonald Trump and Kim Jong on and this part of the world is kind of important and meanwhile were arguing over high school yearbooks and ... and ... thing and God Knows what else\nAnd I think it's time we paid a little more attention to it so I reached out to a guy who I think is just one of the best in terms of understanding the region his name is Gordon Chang he's an author a columnist you see 'em on TV all the time he gets it a Gordon Chang thank you for taking time to talk to us\nToday how are you I'm fine thank you and thank you so much for this opportunity\nWell I this is kind of an important part of the world you know more than twenty percent of the world's population a resides in a real small region and they have incredible economic impact not just in their area but on us\nAnd I'm I'm a little tense a not so much about North Korea anymore although I think where we should be keeping an eye on them\nBut I think China is starting to get to be a a little bolder why why suddenly now or are they coming within forty five yards of our naval ships and\nTrying to affect our elections\nWell that's a great question Mike and I think the Chinese have been doing this for quite some time we don't know about a lot of these incidents or we don't know the seriousness seriousness of the incidents\nBecause the navy for quite some time has actually been trying to downplay these um encounters [laughter] the the Chinese have been acting recklessly and I think that they have sense that we're a little bit afraid of them so they become bolder and bolder\nThe one good thing about the incident that occurred over the weekend is that that may be released a photographs of this immediately and that's important because it says to Beijing back off\nYou know under the current administration we're now see both sides of the aisles think that the United states needs to be more resolute needs to be tougher nice to have a different view of China\nAnd that's a good thing and so the restrictions working pretty hard to change and we heard a lot of that and vice president Pence's speech today\nWell if you have a listen to people you can find it it's on line and you can do something is geek is going to C SPAN and watch it which I recommend 'cause I think vice president Pence has the potential\nTo be a secret weapon for Donald Trump while the media is watching President Trump kind of freelance and some of these situations uh my parents appears to be very methodical and pragmatic in not only his language but his actions\nAnd uh I think he is a a real secret weapon for this administration and that speech to me was welcomed\nNow Gordon Chang if we're looking at China and like you said the bold steps that they made the bull moose they made this weekend and the things we've seen lately with them a kind of trying to sway public opinion in areas affected by the tariffs\nIs this a reaction or possibly reaction because their economies taken a hit based on the tariffs that Donald Trump has imposed\nWell certainly the Chinese economy right now as fragile um Beijing is pouring a lot of money into your\nAnd get

checking in GM welcome to the buck Sexton show tests due to my friend\nGood to talk to yeah\nWhat's your what's your thoughts on the Korea and Russia situation\nWhile I myself I think the reason why North Korea is kind of stall are now and some of the other issues that we are going on is because they're just she after these germs\nIf Trump's going to get impeached or add more problems because if that happens then they're in a clear\nThere they find find anyone else to put up there that can deal with like Donald Trump dodge and that's what they're hoping for are you are just getting her feet and waiting to see what ... and our media plays into that too because they keep promoting all\nInteresting thought gym but I Do think diplomacy on this level takes time\nI also believe as I told some of my more liberal friends who are staying at the mouth going we're going to get to ask and they were gonna we might get the sense that we're going to impeach down Trump and then we're going to get him out and I say you realize that meets president pen will be a reality and if you think President Trump\nHas been tough on liberals and on on people who\nAre sticking it to America wait till you see what President kids would do and they were going to get him to ... we got a plan for him\nTo show I'm not sure about that I just I think diplomacy on this level takes time we saw progress in the Russia situation today with seven more Russian soldiers being indicted now they're never going to extradite him here\nBut I don't trust been tougher on Russia than Brock Obama ever dreamed he could be tough on Russia\nSo uh I I think it's about time and it's about\nTrump being blustery in his speaking\nAnd then the the uh the pragmatic approach has to go through all the steps of diplomacy to keep in mind that gym but thank you for checking in let's say a stay in Pennsylvania and see what's on Felix is mind Felix welcome to the buck Sexton show sir\nI was a big fan of Howard Stern in the eye and said I Want to indicate I Want okay Seventy eight Seventy nine eighty it was very comic to say that girls and women went to college to get around the rest of the great\nWell I I understand that we're talking about uh let's go a decade forward and I don't know if\nThe Emirates degree was as much of a cultural thing in the late eighties and the early nineties as it was in the in the seventies and I think saying in twenty Eighteen\nIs a rather insensitive to the women today it's kind of insulting to women you I'll tell you what you go to a woman today a twenty five year old woman say why don't you just work out and get your eye Maurice degree toilets\nBut what did you go back to that day I mean I Wonder if you go to school or in the early eighties right\nNow the late eighties she was in high school in the ah that that was the whole argument about this\nAnd that she initially said this happened in the mid to late eighties and then she ... high school\nWas eighty three eighty or eighty four for him\nSo he was getting out of college in the late eighties and I think a little bit different back then\nYou know I already had a female vice presidential candidate and the same time but eh yeah I understand what you're saying you're saying a stern was making a reference bad but I'm Talking about his references to day you start talking about women getting I'm not exactly sure what that meant\nBut uh I think that was something we weren't supposed to hear or once opposed to say but there it is\nA Michael Palin ... my name is ... the godfather to the buck Sexton audience and uh
