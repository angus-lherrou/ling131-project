{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "This amendment which I have offered is simply declare it tore of what I regard as the law of the land already that every person ... and the limits of the United states and subject to their jurisdiction is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United states this will not\nOf course include person born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United states but will include every other class of\nPersons that's right notch\nForeigners okay this is different than do people who are permanent residents were green card holders there are no longer\nForeigners they may not old citizenship but they're not consider foreigners for the purposes of this discussion but\nIt is very clear should be very clear that it was never the intention\nOf um the ... of the\nPeople who are drafting this of the senator back in Eighteen sixty six Jacob how for example who was who was talking about this amendment and there were dropping some and it was never there intention that this would extend to people who are in the United states illegally\nAnd now this is where we get into some complexity and some difficulty because for quite a while now it has been treated as such and this is where we get the anchor baby phenomenon right if you come into America and you have a child\nThe law has banned the way that the federal government has interpreted the laws that we have on the books\nIs that you have a citizen now or you have citizenship\nSo if you come into America you have a child this has led to some open it outright scams of the system most notably with the citizenship a or a birth tourism or citizenship are\nScams that are run and there have been all stories on that so where in California particularly you have people from East Asia who\nWill fly to California and stay in a a specific hotel and and the whole purpose of this is that the they're when they're you know nine months pregnant\nSo that they give birth here that with a child that citizenship in this country and they can then go back to the mainland China or wherever and then when they want to go to college or they want to you know moved to the states when they're older they already have citizenship\nWell gee that's that's a pretty that's pretty sweet deal isn't it but citizenship is not supposed to be a commodity that people can just sort of snatched for themselves whenever they want they're supposed to be more to it\nThan that and we obviously can tell that it's a scam when people are showing up here and just having a child and then leaving\nBut oh but it's a citizen right oh but this person to citizen people say ... what about military what about um bachelor's abroad yeah they're on official government business and they're abroad on behalf of the United states so it's obvious that there should be and has been an exception for people under those circumstances\nI'm but illegal aliens\nThis by the way it goes right to the heart of of what the what the Democrats have been not just allowing but encouraging now for decades which is people violate our laws and then they benefit from that violation of law and they ... or a combination of emotional appeal and political pressure\nOverrides an actual plane interpretation of what the statutes are and it's unfair to the American people\nOur government is supposed to be putting our interests ahead of the interest of those and the rest of the world who just want to be here and that means enforcing\nWhat yes I understand on a philosophical level who's a citizen of what country who's born in ... in one country and other that's all it's unfair\nBut life is unfair and nation states are inherently somewhat arbitrary system just like the lines on a map at separate them are generally arbitrary yes some of them have geographic boundaries but a lot of the time it's just okay well that's where the line that's where the line is\nAnd if there is no government enforcement of that than the line ceases to exist if there is no government enforcement of laws around immigration\nThan those laws in effect ceased to exist and then you keep working back from this and you'll find yourself saying whoa whoa whoa hold on a second here\nWhat dark rats really what the Democrats\nReally want and what do they believe the fourteenth amendment says and and they clearly believe that and and ... it's not just believe that it's also desire\nOr that anyone who comes to this country and has an anchor baby a we'll have that person to be a citizen because then that makes it a that makes it much much more likely\nThat later on that person will be able to sponsor oh that's\nRight you get to sponsor family family reunification right\nSo if you if you come what say from Honduras because that's in the news a lot right now if you come from ... to the United states you are waiting to find out if you get asylum\nYou have a ... maybe a five year lag you have a baby in America but you're you're not in the country in any permanent status around the country even really legally you're going through a process to determine your legality if you\nHave that child\nIn America and then you go back to Honduras let's just say theoretically you could have family reunification migration ... chain migration to bring interest the family in some oil but it was at one kid in America I Know you're\nAlready at the front of the line when it comes to the immigration system we have to think about the it's not just the incentive for that one child that's the incentive for the entire family now\nYou know the uh what was it the uh I'm trying to remember the name of the group but I Do I can tell you the center for Immigration Studies there you go\nAbout a fifth\nIn five and twenty fourteenth seven hundred and Ninety One thousand\nA birth in the United states were to an immigrant's whether legal or illegal\nAnd illegal immigrants counted for seven point five percent which is almost three hundred thousand so in twenty four teams believe that three hundred thousand illegal aliens had children in the United states\nBut it's not just that three hundred thousand or so remember that's a few years ago it could be even higher now it's a three hundred thousand plus then the likely sponsoring of their entire family reunification oh but maybe it's even more complicated than that\nBecause once you've had that child in this country let's say that you are here illegally and you've had a child now you have a citizen child you know the Democrats are going to say oh we can't separate families\nThe down roads four hundred thirty two points that asked

Andrew Gillum is an example of somebody who I\nI don't know how you can think he's a good idea for the state of Florida I mean I we've played it on this show and the ... election I think is probably going to get more national attention than any other election in his mentor\nBut dealing with a guy who a lot of people focused on obviously is a young telegenic African American and you know and and the state of Florida politically\nIs a kind of Lynch Penn State for anybody in twenty twenty and that's why you know when you when you look at this and you try and assess\nThe conversation around this race you've got to remember that it's not just even about this it's about how it sets up\nThe the future uh for the Democrat Party and you\nKnow there's going to give them though we've we've talked or we've talked about it before on the show doesn't know how we pay for some of these programs doesn't know how he would uh actually improve health care but really when it comes down to is a lot of these politicians they they talk of the game about how they're going to get more health care to people really it's just they're going to raise\nTaxes and expand Medicaid that's all it's going to be raised taxes expand Medicaid and Medicaid health\nOutcomes are really poor and you're not going to get better health outcomes just by having more state dollars thrown into programs you know we we've seen this with schools you can spend a lot of money on schools and have them be bad you can spend a whole lot more a lot less money on schools and have them be good but the lid answer is always just more money for schools\nThat's more money more money and when you look and pull it apart\nYou actually get into the nuts and bolts of what's happening in our education system which you see is that\nThe money isn't going to the kids it's not even one of the teachers going to these bureaucrats administrators the\nTeaching system what do you thing happens with the state state paid for medical systems a tremendous amount of waste and abuse so I mean given image to a bad idea but you also get a sense he's kind of a it's kind of a nasty guy\nUm you know he's very very willing to a state whatever he thinks he has to say about the opposition which I guess it's true of all Democrats these days but it probably fourteen\nMost of the fact is is how the given too much harbor a\nTwo races you know anti Semite he himself when he became the Republican nominee went on Fox News to the voters voted not to monkey the fate of price race has been an issue from the very beginning and the campaign that because I introduced is having my grandmother used to have the same [noise]\nUs [laughter] because you get dirty but he actually like [noise]\nWhat to do is a threat to the gutter yeah but I\nKnow because they can survive getting dirty\nNow let me just take a moment does stand back with you and just admire what what happened there that\nIs a rhetorical technique known as ... veteran CEO is\nI could talk about how my opponent is a\nComplete moron who would be nowhere without his family money but I'm not going to do that it is doing the thing that you say you will not do as a form of attack\nAnd a a\nPrint urge CEO in this case is on full display he says well you know the scientists said monkey it up at the state and he's clearly saying just ... just as a racist that's what that is with any but then he immediately switch to\nBudge I don't want to play dirty and wrestle with pigs so I won't\nDo that or the the classic cynical technique of politicians and it's right there on display for you from uh from Guillaume or who I Would notice that my understanding is Tallahassee has got a lot of problems in the city which is not surprising at all\nOf the supporters of the left by like this was during a moment of silence for Pittsburgh victims Marsha Blackburn had a had a rally and she called for a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh and\nThen they pay in this is nonsense\nPeople will say there was like oh they ... they'll they'll there'll be paying taxes to really\n\nA vast majority of of people who are earning what illegal aliens earn are going to over the course of their lifetime take much more and government benefits and they pay in taxes\nBut even close\nSo how does this make us wealthier better off as a country by the way we're always hearing about how divided we are as a nation oh we're so divided\nOkay how is it supposed to make us less divided you bring people into this country or allow them to come into the country and stay who do not speak the language who do not share our culture and whose first by definition first act on us soil is to break the law\nThat's going to bring us together that has some\nUnifying effect that are up to this point the most of us had been on aware of that I that that strikes me as very strange that strikes me is very unlikely\nBut they've been lying to us about this for a long long time there are many many people who have a vested interest\nIn propagating this lie even further and propping it up\nOh Schmidt by the way is not is not done with the big fat joke stupid thing that he's staying very still ... keep playing it\nKellyanne Conway despicable early today goes on national television and she said well this shooter's motives\nWere because there's an anti religious out of it no man the propaganda industry that she commands with a vial president that she serves a bet it by mark ... van and Rush Limbaugh\nAnd Breitbart News pastors and judicial watch and all the rest of them have blood on their hands for the insight maps that they have made that have triggered and radicalized these crazy people it is delivered in in ...\nHe said do low rent it out OK let's just guys aggressively aggressively stupid and the fact that he was in charge of the McCain presidential campaign in at any level tells you really all you need to\nKnow but why McCain's campaign was do and he also was the one I think the thought that Sarah Palin at the VP was the great a great idea writer who is\nPart of that whole process so but he but to the to the main point here claiming that Breitbart and ... a rash and a little van and others have blood on their hands is just is just a a\nA smear each just slanderous\nIt has no basis in any reality especially because the first of all really\nHe's he's going to go out he's going to go after Mark LeVine after an anti after an anti Semitic shooting in a synagogue these complete buffoon on MSNBC speaking about propaganda that's out there he's going to go after ...\nWow I mean it showed brazen that there I just can't figure out is she too stupid to know the full scope of what he's saying or is he in fact just that cynical that he doesn't care and that MSNBC\nPut this on their air and allows us to continue by the way I'm sure there were other segments of the right before right after this about how we need to restore civility in our conversation\nAfter they got this guy yeah the guy got blood on time for the thing about the thing to do but with the now with the who\nLook mark within doesn't need me to catch his back but I I got to say you know that it's just it's just an outrage somebody would set of em are at war or about\nRussia or any of total outrage by MSNBC is maybe that's why I don't spend as much time on it because MSNBC is almost in terms of stupidity well it's more honest about being a bunch of leftist it's really beneath contempt\nUh it it really is that a level where it's not worth analyzing it because you only watch that if you really believe\nThat history does not matter that capitalism is not a good thing that a math is not an essential elements of good policy making ... ... that's the only way you can watch MSNBC\nAnd that everybody should climate there are a victim and just fight over who's a bigger victim and that that's a recipe for a healthy society that's the basis of the MSNBC watchers mind\nMan\nIt is it has been rough watching all these people just make complete in Brussels with themselves just\nOutrageous stuff and then turn around and want to be taken seriously and other things\nOh wait wait since we're talking about the dumbest people on TV it let's just throw in one one more one more out there who is a quote\n... conservative or you know who's coming\nThe laughs favorite all I Do is jump on the right person that is allegedly on the right Jennifer Rubin who ... you know I I just before we before we get to her her little part of this\nOne of my favorite things\nThat I have a red in in a long time was my friend Charles Cooke who's a brilliant writer and I I Wish we saw and heard more from Charles these days I think he's just enjoying life in Florida but I've always really liked Charles and thought he was very talented or but Charles did this piece that was comparing what Jennifer Rubin writes\nOne year and then writes the next year and it's like a person with schizophrenia fighting with herself in writing all the time\nIt's like this is a really good idea for Israel is a terrible for Israel you know this is a really good thing for conservative this is talk of her conservative\nOr there's no consistency your principal whatsoever but you're Ruben sure enough he's an opening to trash Trump ready Semitism she's taken to play Fifteen\nThat's not the rain has had the entire country that's not ... on people respond to things like that out there talking about his tax plan that out there talking about these fake prey outline tales\nTo Verizon blaming the bloody shirt and that's why we got our our\n... I I you know guys we hit the edge ... I don't want you to get frustrated we hit the she used to do it too stupid now we can't we're we're ...

I think we've got a winner\nIn Julie or your ... or ...\nWho I did not know this uh had been fired from Politico for a tweet suggesting that the president commits incest and she's very coarse language not just as the thoughts disgusting but the president commits incest with his own daughter\nThat's that's who political head on staff yeah\nShe got fired ah because I guess even for the live media there are some limits to how protest they can be and still be quote unquote journalists\nBut Jake Tapper owes so famous fake tapper\nOh show serious tapper who just can't stop chin wagging about how he's the most uh you know down the middle you know Ernest gum shoe journalist ever\nKnow and oh and oh by the way you know how much he loves charity and the troops let them tell you a hundred times a day it just you know enough Jake we we get it or\nYou know this is a guy though who is ... Ito will get very gets very aggressive with conservatives on a regular basis gets very aggressive with people around the president calls amount called them for being liars and all that he has the off on a show and does not stop her\nOr challenged her at all when she says the following yesterday play quip one\nYou know that's passed that at one of the things that ... where they launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rattle radicalization\nAnd lift president has radical I sell many more people than I suffered to add I mean the way he talks the way the way that is that says it it's hot out the way the way they say ah allows the way he was ...\nYeah that's right presidents radicalized more people than ISIS now now I I Know that there's there are some people who might say hold on a second book you know if you're taught if you think that being a conservative as radical and they tried to rationalize this in some way but none of what she just did there\nWas to compare the president and therefore his supporters who she says had been radicalized goes\nSo far there's only been one radical that we know of who's actually been violent who's a Trump supporter one out of sixty three million that voted for Trump never mind those who didn't vote for him but think he's great it was a lot of those do\nWe've got one that we know of\nWe don't have people run around in the streets like we do with anti fall in large numbers causing mayhem and the name of Trump people that's all on the left\nWe don't have anybody who's actually harmed and come very close to assassinate ending or a member of the opposing party as we do with these deep Scully shooter Don Lemon treated out today that he can't even imagine a Democrat being violent Steve ...\nRetreated that just with with these eyes looking up at the sky like are you kidding me\nDon Lemon multimillionaire newsman image also Trump's right he's just not don't let me just not very smart and he's very insecure about that because he's just not just not very smart\nBut\nKnow you look at the way that this conversation happens and and and the way that the left tries to frame it and you know you off a decides that ... whatever she decided that the way to get attention here and she succeeded in that regard it should just go even crazier than everybody else the Islamic state\nBut any totalitarian caliphate for a few years that in slate millions of people that engaged in massive kidnapping torture and rape operations as a function of of war and policy like they did that systematically\nA murder or at least\nTens of thousands probably hundreds of thousands of people if you were to really kind of a mass graves horrific televised torture executions\nAnd she thinks that she thinks that it's in any way rational and reasonable\nTo compare Trump and his radicalized supporters to the Islamic state in in any context\nNow the only defense that I can come up with for free yeah your coffee here\nAnd she's indefensible but I mean the only way that you could really try to explain this as well there are so many people in the left that casually\nCompare Trump to Hitler at this point casually compare Trump to you know the third Reich and uh and ... and say that there's all this this rise of white nationalism and Nazis and that's occurred under Trump\nNone of the you know I remember when Brock Obama was president\nAnd there were all these all these stories from\nThe uh you know the Southern Poverty Law Center on these other groups oh there's this terrible rise of white nationalist groups because of Obama\nAnd nothing happened for eight years in the white nationalist there's like fifty losers no one pays attention to really or just pathetic and want it and want attention you know the white nationalist are really the equivalent of like the Westboro Baptist church but the media makes it out\nTo be oh this scourge they're coming for us and they're going to take over everything\nThey're just delusional I mean there are ... well it's not even to the delusional they're they're really cynical because this serves their interest their interest is to make a white nationalist seeing what they are much bigger than they are much more\nMenacing than they are because that's a means of of attacking Trump but yeah you off he came back after that break and said that you know she got a little ...\nJake Tapper must have in the break realized just control them I'm sure Guns Germs and did you can't get into that but the President's Day and we're going to keep pretending remember this isn't even on a quote opinion show trapper runs [laughter] it's laughable but to ever runs a a straight news show\nWhich is a joke and it's just a total joke but you know if\nYou were honest about what you'll notice how much less go after Matt Lauer and O'Donnell and you know I even I even had a a\nWe're going to have to find work around or at least have a greater understanding of what's going on at these places and greater transparency because think about it this way if if a small I ate really infinitesimal amount of money spent on Facebook ads by ... by some Russian\nA troll farmers if that can be thought to sway an election what do you think Google and Facebook can do and by the way do entirely legally that's much better than in many ways in in ... contribution to one side of the other\nThe

J. radio birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment you\nObviously cannot do that you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order\nCritics say the right of citizenship for immigrant children born in the country is constitutionally protected and playing the president is using the issue to stir up Republican voters ahead of next week's mid term elections\nPresident Trump and first lady millennia visited Pittsburgh hospitals treating victims of last week's synagogue shooting that left eleven dead earlier they visited the synagogue and a makeshift memorial to the victims several hundred protesters also turned out demonstrating against the president's visit [noise]\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nRussia they don't have any writers here unscripted show as\nEarly improv show just shovel you win the em [noise]\n\nBack when you know because when it comes to the fight for so long memories stuff [noise]\nI'm getting twenty five and thirty thousand people to these rallies nobody's ever seen there hasn't been a decision bragging that inevitably in anything like what's happening I went to Illinois University ... seven forty said this massive hangar pack\nThat is the second day for the overflow\nNobody's saying and always look what happened to Ted Cruz is doing great how we left you send these linguist\nThat's right it's not brag and he's just telling it like it is ... all over the place how's it looking for the midterms is the Trump effect going to carry the day is the cabinet wave still a thing answering these questions and more we have with us now Betty Johnson reporter\nThe Daily Caller Mr Johnson great to have you back\nPay but thank you so much for having yeah\nSo do you think that they're going to be a lot of lives eating Ben and Jerry's resist ice cream or on election night in order to to do all the hurt and and deal with all the tears or they go in the house or how we look in right now\nYes Ben and Jerry's resist ice cream actually comes with a warning label on the back that says it does taste better if you're\nCrying liberal tears into it and you mix it up and the extra salty and the extra sweet it goes together beautifully\nThat's good my and I think there's gonna be a lot of that election night but there are trending\nPolls upward for Republicans nationwide you have a lot of races are particularly after the calving off the cabin on fact you mentioned earlier a lot of races that were toss up\nA swinging right a lot of races that were ... steady down that have swung to toss up a lot of races that Republicans seemed doom and Democrats seem to be able to cling onto his seat that has now won um massively in the direction of the pie\nAs we were a lecture babies are tightening ... races like in Tennessee races I'm like in Missouri but it really is trending upward for the ...\nYou think that a Ted Cruz is going to from an electoral perspective\nKicked the skateboard out from under ... and tell them the Sylvie heavy stuff is allowed\n[laughter] there's actually a viral clip from Ted Cruz yesterday the republic on the Daily Caller or where he where he told or where he told a a a reporter who asked him about Texas getting their first Latino senator uh what is there a shortage is there a shortage of Irish men in the U.S Senate\nBecause beta of courses are actually Robert Francis ... is very very Irish and Ted Cruz's half with\n... and married to a billionaire by the way how does that not really ever get reported until now I've been reading about this guy for months I just found out that he's married to a billionaire families and tends to what his own financial interests are at stake side with the plutocrats over the people but he was shocked about ... Cho\nBook what a shock I mean what else are you going to say billionaire who's very tall billionaire versus federal how could but the millionaires and billionaires from his campaign practice with\nBlue I didn't know if you remember the count like count Dracula thing there that was Bernie first I'm Glad we figured out it was it was Bernie but I Do feel like I Do feel like Bernie I'd rather be Joe or got got kind of a pass for being incredibly wealthy and so every time I see this guy\nHe's got the rolled up sleeves and he's been described as Kennedy asking I'm like oh so he's a silver spoon her\nWho's running around with a nickname for the culture that is not his own okay that's interesting\n[noise] yeah well correct at least as these on a skateboard there's less of a chance for him to hit someone while drunk driving in a vehicle and actually hurt them and\nThen he can still flee the scene on a skateboard my friend don't think that's not possible\n[laughter] either way whatever happens whatever the cops but in the police report it was alive remember that but it was a lie\nThere you go to ... always lie about things like that so do you have any races that you're looking at a that you think are\nWhere where you're expecting Republican to over perform expectations up to this point or you know who do you really let me at best question for your ... who do you really care about seeing get the W. on election night was only a few days away but I mean who who if you get W by their names are you going to say it's a good day for freedom a good day for America\nRight so you have a of course you have Ted Cruz versus beta now what that is is just\nPosition recorded twenty that was the candidate a liberal journalist right now are writing the beta la Brea actually one writer shout out to the journal is right now that are that are already have that piece prepared because they do is down by double digits in Texas\nOr this just isn't going to happen for him also the president of course is who is lost her campaign or an Israeli actually\nMoving the needle her a lot of close races the president's going to do a ten day I attend a campaign stop ... or the next seven days up to election day or he's throwing these throwing something on a herd of on the campaign trail with his tail ... there's so many people that showed up for the Texas\nIt has an obligation to try to read us up much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years as helpful meant that\nThe president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point she doesn't dog whistle continues as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence\nDirectly at the same so how do you marry the situation with the president last week says he's a national thought he had to do is say white nationalist to that he does have to take some responsibility for the pipe for refunds bio climate that we find ourselves and\nTheir presence opposite races there's obviously a demagogue condos that is because I'm stuck so national it said this is all the left\nReally has by the way at the national level for why you should vote for Democrats Trump is so terrible Trump is such an awful person\nAnd what they don't seem to understand is how much that factors in to the other side beating our sides unwillingness to change any of our tactics\nThey're not trying to convince us they are trying to strong arm us into abandoning trumpeter bending the movement they're not making good arguments they're engaging in moral blackmail\nWhy would anybody who's really thinking about the issues and thinking about what affects them and their day to day lives\nWhy would they listen to any of this they're not even saying hey let's have a bigger European style social welfare state with free college and free healthcare now and as you know there's no such thing as free so it's really a ... you know\nState paid for health care and state paid for college which means you pay for just a question of how much and who and then let\nThe mayhem of the bureaucracy get unleashed in terms of price and and the distribution of care and everything else but you're not even hearing them make a real picture about any of this\n... this is where we are the Democrats I think had been anticipating either a bad economy right a ... a downturn economy right before the election\nWar they were anticipating that people would become\nShow beaten down by the anti Trump rhetoric and all this stuff about racism and racist Republicans and they're so terrible on a show of all that stuff they really thought\nThat that would be enough I think to turn the tables against Trump but they don't understand is by doing that\nThey're actually making the case because there's only some people were going to be persuaded right you're you're never going to you're not going to turn the tables with some ... hat\nWearing Trump early stage true believer many of whom listen to the show and high five to all of you for seeing a political movement that Ninety five percent of the professional political class\nHad no idea what's happening until basically an editor already occurred on election day right so you guys thought Ninety five percent of the professional political elites did not but you're obviously not going to change your mind based on\nWhat they said no matter no matter what right I mean 'cause you see the result but I'm Talking about if this is really a function of the persuadable going into this midterm election a few days right we're we're a week away\nFrom finding out who controls the Senate who controls the house that has profound implications for the next two years and it's not the most important election of our lifetime that is not true okay that'd be stuck with that\nIs twenty twenty gonna be the most important election would probably be the second most important election of my lifetime because I think the most important was twenty six feet\nSo twenty twenty will probably be the second most important I don't think you're ever going to outdo twenty sixteen but you know obviously every election really matters and and the next two years or that the tone will be set\nIn terms of legislation and what the government's going to do by how this midterm shakes out and that's why I just think it's so noticeable the Democrats aren't even\nAt the at the national level and they're trying to do this thing and every different race will do they're trying to run a good candidate for the district right or a good candidate in that state if it's kind of a purple state so they have these people that are a little centrist on some issues it's like the Joe Manchin affect\nHow was Joe mansion even a Democrat because he likes unions I you know you look at it because\nHe's pro worker when Trump is pro worker so you know you get some of these people who are Democrats who might as well be Republicans there's a few of those but much more common with on the left or people that are pretending to be a more ...\nThe actress than they will vote to sexually fool the voters and then get in bed with the Democrats later I mean that that the more common tactic that's much more likely to be or what you see happening and and that's why it's either a local local media markets stuff about\nHow protecting or protecting preexisting conditions and Obamacare and that's what this is all about but at the national level all you're hearing you get base turnout molested Trump is the Trump is a racist these terrible\nAnd you know they're just they're never going to stop so that's why whenever they make it sound like oh if only Trump would only job would want what stop being Trump and you'll like him this is nonsense words are based on who I mentioned twenty twenty and how do the second most important election of of my lifetime or I liked the trumpet it say about this last night and Laura Ingraham show place\nSo far I like them all\nI don't see anybody right now and I should probably shut down and I like her to be very happy with Hillary I like 'em all [laughter] I don't see anybody that I wouldn't enjoy running against\nYou know the truth is that is the truth is nobody right\nNow that Trump looks at across the aisle things oh wow I don't know if I could ... I think that person might have the you know the magic formula to beat me oh wow you know I don't know\nThere's nobody there was nobody that's even close I the only one who you think maybe\nAs enough of a wild card that will be interesting is Bernie Sanders and I think what people figure out more about the more people know about Bernie Sanders policies at the national level the west they're going to like him but that's a pretty big vulnerability\nYou know you're burning coal to you talk to me ... ... but when you find out you're gonna have to pay Seventy percent of your income in taxes I I don't think you're going to want to feel the burn quite the way he does [noise]\nSecurity breaches happen all the time now you may be thinking well it usually is a big company and\nWho knows if the bad guys of the actors will ever get my information well let me tell you something\nIf you ever use public wife I guess what whatever you're doing anything on your computer you're being cracked\nAnd your private information therefore can be put at risk it can also be sold and use the ways we don't want it to you that's why you won a virtual private network and express VPN is simply the best one you can get expressed VPN has easy to use apps that runs themes in the background of\nMy computer phones and tablets and turning on expressed VPN protection is so simple it costs less than seven dollars a month you can do with one click\nI Know about online security I'm telling you express BPA and is what you need to protect your online activity today and find out you can get three months free and expressed V.

Fox News President Trump considering ending a policy where children born in the west to parents who are illegal immigrants are automatically US citizen Democrats slamming the plant\nSomehow gets or other pushed aside because of the politics or maybe there's just some some on his confusion on the part of those who are trying to get a handle on this epidemic but we always hear that it's the priest gets prescription drugs that are pushing this epidemic for what you're telling me\n... it's it's really that these are\nSimilar to prescription drugs but there are being obtained\nIllegally and being made illegally\nSo ... is is that an accurate reader of what's going on here because it is being made invests in Mexico it's obviously they're not being filtered through Pfizer and then sold via legitimate pharmacies to people in the streets this is just cutting out Pfizer has ... from the picture and or any drug company entirely from his\nParents who are we so we know that there was a problem and we know that there was a problem with the pharmaceutical companies and that's been very public and that you know the danger of you know over prescribing a opioids to patients even when you're going in for a debt tool\nFor dental work there was over prescription of opioids on we saw a rise in that not only with veteran but with but with people across the board in the United states when when the escalation of addiction\nRates started sky rocketing but what what happened was as soon as those issues began to be regulated and of course the federal government stepped in Dr stopped over prescribing for the most part one of the things that happened was the drug cartels said wow look at that\nWe can potentially be making billions off of this and that's exactly what they're doing and not just the drug cartels but China China is also a cooperative this with that and all and I think we've been hearing a lot about that at least a little bit more in the news media and\nWhat they've done is they have created their own till they're owned pharmacies and and they made him look like the actual pill so some of the markings I was actually in Ohio talking to some of the undercover da ... that are working there and some of the local law enforcement who work with the da\n... look he's pills are almost identical you look at it as an ex it looks like a Xanax that would be made by a a a pharmaceutical company but it's not it's not a real down next it's not a real purpose that it's not a real actually caught\nEither way taking notes for recreational use is dangerous it's addictive it and to live last\nBut when you see it come talented with enormous amount of narcotics that are being spilled into our streets this poison\nAnd I'd sure but you you hear about this all the time but that in all it's so dangerous that in its pure form\nWhich has moved across the United states many times in its pure form could literally cause someone to over just didn't die by just touching it and in the documentary it's explained very well that only for grant for little grains like foreign little grains of table salt\nOf that no could literally kill a grown man and we've seen loads of this stuff come into the United states for example\nIn April this year in Nebraska and state troopers they seized over a hundred and Eighteen pounds is that in all\nAnd authority said this is enough to kill twenty six million people when we showcased\nAre ... and premier the movie here in Washington DC and then showcased in Ohio which was which is really the epicenter we use Ohio as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country when we showcased it they're one of the head of the DEA Mario him in it\nCame and talked to the audience you know the full house because Ohio is really struggling with addiction rate and he said look if I close up this theater right now\nAnd they released a small package affecting all through the air system\nWe would all be dead\nHe said so this is no longer just about addiction this is about saving our children's lives\nRealizing that this is a potential national security threat really understanding where this is coming from and not being ashamed not being ashamed about addiction we have to come out you have to talk to our kids we have to let them know without on the street\nWe have to be open and honest with one another if we're ever going to find a solution and I'm not saying we're going to find a solution to stopping addiction we have to stop this before something potentially so dangerous happen before we lose a generation of our kids\nAnd we have to face it and we have to be honest about it [noise]\n[noise] serve this this documentary tacos what is the biggest health crisis in the United states are more people are dying from this than died from the height of the AIDS epidemic or the crack epidemic in this country when when you speak to these families obviously\nGoing to be very and people would have been affected by this and in any respect it's very it's very emotional and and it's it's haunting for people there's clearly now a greater awareness of it than ever before what what is the answer what can we do about this\nI think first of all people have to find their lane everybody in ... in\nAn all parts of the ... our communities need to find out what they can do what's their role as a parent it's educating your child as a health care provider it's understanding what's going on and be able to be aware of of the potential dangers out there and\nAssessing those right away so we can save lives and that people we have to realize you have a problem with addiction we also have to have the right resources appropriate at the right way so that when the federal government put money\nAside for this epidemic\nThat there's accountability for it that this money isn't being funneled through the federal system through state and local agencies and and just disappearing into the bath array of our of our money pet but that it's actually working\nAnd that we support our law enforcement and our federal law enforcement I Believe that as this as we start looking at this on a broader scale especially\nWith the threat of setting all especially with the threat of the drug cartels and now they're pouring this poison into our system and into our children's lives we call it not in Dane B. E. I. N. dot in Dane\nThe drug cartels are using the veins of our highways to infiltrate and move their contraband into the United states and that didn't you are people's gains and into our children's games when we have to find a way to stop this we have to work with our southern partners with Mexico\nWith Colombia with Guatemala with Nicaragua with El Salvador we have to insist that they do their part and honestly there were a few people in the documentary that brought up some great ideas you know look this is not just a criminal organization this has now become a transnational terrorist\nThe American people have had it with this\nHad with it Kavanaugh the care of that and blaming Trump for everything under the sides if you want to change the way the country is going and you want to tell these people they got it wrong\nThen vote a week from tomorrow for the Republican Party the only way they're going to change his for them to lose ... cabin are the main anything and if you don't want any more Kavanaugh character assassination uh then you need to recheck what they did and hand them ... feet\nThey deserve they want power so badly the media is and the tank for them and the only way they'll get it as for the American people to send a loud and clear signal that we're tired of you tired of their attack they blaming every Republican for everything\nI think this is an essential element of the Trump movement it really is it really is a strategy winning and winning and winning really is a political strategy and I know that that sounds ridiculous because it has not always the strategy no in fact Republicans for a long time we're happy to lose as long as they last like gentleman\nBut that obviously didn't get the left to act more gentle men lead just got the left who say oh great we're winning screw the other guys\nTrump comes in and says okay it's not going to be perfect it's not going to be pretty but if we want them to change we've gotta when Lindsey Graham is saying that you and you know what Lindsey Graham two point oh\nIs correct [noise]\n\n\nYeah she's a Bloomberg market minute Wall Street wiped out yesterday's losses with strong gained in the last hour of trading stock average just finishing a session up one and a half\nTo about one in three quarters percent\nWithout it best day in two weeks up four hundred thirty two point the NASDAQ\nAt it a hundred eleven he has to be forty one investors decided optimism was the track to take on trade and eventually to on tech shares bargain hunters helps\nInvestors sent Facebook shares higher waiting for the closing bell and to look at the social networks quarterly earnings they sent chairs edging higher post market after seeing a small gaining users in North America even the revenue and\nOverall user growth did not meet analysts targets\n... shares tumbled nearly nine percent the company announced a wider federal accounting investigation and private equity firms are shopping for pizza Reuters reports Bain Capital and CBC capital partners are among the firm's competing to buy papa Johns I jumped on a girl Bloomberg Radio\n[noise]\nWants to end underpaid um how we knew it\nWe're here to change that one thousand dollars [laughter] wouldn't one thousand dollars every hour radio seven ten WINZ ham\nThe challenge for your vaccine and when I feel I mean it may get\nRain in front of your least favorite coworkers driven by mobile bay hardly David you ownership you wedded to the Gulf Coast premier spot for all think Harley Davidson is where you can get a new army for his lowest one oh nine I'm off find their events on Facebook there's always a party at ...
