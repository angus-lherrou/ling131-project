party I could not concluded that Brett Kavanaugh was her assailant\nChina have it always and you can't say somebody as credible and then completely question that story is shocking to me and what she said and how she voted because that's political cowardice on that is somebody who is pretending to be a feminist fake feminist on\nFake feminism a former Hillary Clinton hack their Psaki said wait is that is the Hillary Clinton or no no I'm Sorry she's a former Obama administration spokesperson for the state department but she was I'm sure she's run that wasn't too\nBut notice how quickly they will just attack attack women who do not go along with the left wing feminist agenda\nRight away they'll attack viciously too because when a woman does not go along and really undermined the power structure\nIt's like within the Islamic faith with the radicals if you were an apostate if you had been within the faith and left\nThe hatred that much more because you're more of a danger because the faithful will see or departure and think why did that person go same is true with radical leftist feminists they see a woman who breaks ranks with them and their response is oh\nMaybe\nMaybe we need well they say we need to destroy his person right away because other women will say hold on a second maybe I can think for myself to maybe there's something else here\nOn and there were there were some people who came through noxious Lindsey Graham who I've given lots of props to already on the show there were others\nI gave Jeff Flake a very hard time I think that he gamble with the Kavanaugh nomination by delaying it a week some would say though had he not delayed it they would not have had the votes I don't know if that's true or not but it's certainly seemed\nLike a a cowardly move at the time to me that said\nWhen push came to shove flake did the right thing here at the moment he had to do it\nSo I'm not saying you know he he's not Spartacus either but he deserves credit\nMansion in West Virginia also deserves some credit but let's also keep it real West Virginia is a state where the sentiment was overwhelmingly in favor of Kavanaugh and against this I'll be as political hit\nCollins from Maine yes I think she did the right thing here I also think that all the radical left his feminist types calling her terrible names and sending her hateful messages for weeks and weeks trying to intimidate her\nTo threaten her into going along with the leftist feminist agenda I think that didn't help\nTheir case and then that brings me to Murkowski now\nDon't know about wait

least she just dodge the question the answer to this is like you know the answer to if somebody asks you if you're a God you say yes\nYou know maybe that's from the answer to each somebody or should somebody follow the person into a restaurant or harassment because of their politics\nAnswer that has no in his owner quickly without question no but she won't say it because she knows where she to say that it would offend\nThe left it would offend the activists the\nEmily ... cows skis and Amy Schumer is and others who love to just pray and you know a list of all I Love the parade around and\nGet arrested by the big mean police and the whole thing this is\nPart of their political culture now the shrill ... the nastiness the shrieking the anger the rage the the public demonstrations of psychological distress that's a defining characteristic\nOn the left now right to have really a a nervous breakdown in public that is what left ism has become and you notice it\nHere and this is we've had all these different examples you know your real Rand Paul have as well rather Rand Paul's wife wrote a letter about how not only was he attacked and all almost beaten to death\nBy a lunatic left wing or\nOr who just hated Rand Paul or was it was not some you know labor dispute is hater Rand Paul attacking from behind them was killed him\nHe had pneumonia he was terrible pain and that's after some lunatic left wing Bernie Sanders supporter tried to shoot Rand Paul on a baseball diamond in Alexandria a Hodgkinson James Hodgkinson the shooter the name you should know the left likes to forget it\nVery conveniently um but you know his wife wrote about how she gets threats her church child or children get a get threats\nAnd prominent Democrats make jokes now they're in the media or in the Democratic party make jokes about the attack on Rand Paul as though it somehow funny this is something cute that they should laugh about similar disgusting\nI keep saying they should be ashamed but they they have no honor and so they don't feel anything when their honor is lost\nIt can't be ... based because there's nothing there to begin with that's one of the problems when you're fighting against the left is that they don't they don't feel the loss of honor because they have nothing to begin with but you know Brian kill me\nIs a guy that I I don't I don't know Brian I work in the

have to come on air and explain to you that you know I got into a a\nA scuffle and a lot of these\nMedia types you know they\nThey think that there are you know impervious to this kind of thing I think that that's not something to worry about but I Would not deal well with some\nA left wing hack following me into the subway look is one thing to wait outside somebody's home and do the ambush interview thing I think that's pretty tasteless I don't like it when conservatives do it either\nI think it's pretty tasteless unless there's a real news reason to do it right unless somebody's refusing to answer questions about something that's really newsworthy each different in the halls of the Senate it's different in a public space a public building with somebody who's a public official\nThat does you know there's a difference in waiting for ... waiting for whether it's Mitch McConnell or you know Dianne Feinstein in the whole the Senate building to ask a question versus waiting outside their home\nThat's weird there are boundaries year but this goes even beyond that\nBecause not only was there the the ambush interview component of this then there was the following him into the subway so that's really ... now you're not just going up to somebody and they walk past you you leave them alone I think that's aggressive but that's done this is following them down in the subway getting in the same subway car\nPublicly trying to humiliate him and then trying to kind of whip up an angry mob against him in the subway car\nWhat if somebody in the subway car you know who heard that Brian kill me there's a racist what if that person got and Brian space I Want to pry and you know felt threatened what if you shut that person what if a Fighting Sioux what if somebody got really hurt\nThat's not a hard thing to create as a possibility here in your mind because they have these these these more on one of the comedians or creating a combustible situation they're creating a scenario in which would not be difficult for there'll be an escalation of physical violence\nAnd you have to think that when they do this time and again when they create these kinds of situations that so clearly could turn into a violent confrontation\nThey don't mind that they're running that rescue starting to sink the navy that's really what they're pushing for this is who the leftist become\nWon't deny it they won't shut this down they won't call it out\nThey are increasingly embracing not just the politics of public nervous breakdowns and acting like psychosis who were\nSlamming on the on the thirteenth on doors of the Supreme Court\nBut also there the left and the Democratic party are bracing the politics of shoppers [noise] ...

sorry [laughter]\nI'm\nIndian blood in me oh God [laughter] and I\nMean [laughter]\nThere's one of my mother and my ... you know we don't know I see your hygiene was why am I doing much hey maybe I'm an Indian\nIsn't are ridiculous books I mean the left wants to lecture us about Trump and his ...\nOr him and his tweets and I'm hearing more and more for my swamp sources that they're the plan really is as much as I'm hoping it's\nHillary may care\nAs much as I'm hoping it's Hillary the plan is going to be warrant for twenty twenty\nMaybe Warren and then a a a a veep ticket of either a Kamala Harris or maybe maybe Booker but they really think it's going to be Warren and you know here's somebody who is entirely unremarkable in her career weren't not for racial fraud\nRacial fraud you know if you will lie about the assets you have in the bank to get a loan to go to jail you know a lot of trouble prison federal prison and if you lie about that you get into a lot of trouble\nIf you lie about your race in order to get into a university or in this case to get a professorship at a at the most prestigious university really at\nHarvard or Democrats as long as you tow the line for them or are willing to excuse the whole thing I mean it it should it seem it's embarrassing and as an Elizabeth Warren has now here's what's important about it to me well there's a lot of things but here's what I won't let go she has never owned up to this\nShe has never said if she came out and said you know what I disagree with our racial spoil system I did this knowing that I could get away with it because I don't believe that this is ethical you know but maybe she could claim but I also think I have enough that technically I caught technically a qualified no\nInstead she pulled this whole high cheekbones thing and then we're supposed to pretend that somebody who went to law school at Rutgers I'm not putting Rutgers down but you don't go to law school at Rutgers and they become a professor at Harvard law you just don't unless you have a special angle\nAnd unless you have something to help you through and she's never been forced to own up to this and the fact that the less I mean this is just like the NFL kneeling thing you know Trump is incredible at\nPicking these areas he he it really is like a political six sense that he has he knows that he can pick things that the less just get so fired up and energized about that they lose sight of whether it's a political winner for them or not\nAnd you know the NFL nearing for example the left thought oh and and these different players who obviously or kneeling ah but the media narrative around this was oh the players they thought that the players would went out and that all these teams would eventually allow kneeling\nAnd Trump kept poking at this thing up you know you guys better stand show because Trump understands that the end of the day\nA vast majority of the American people want respect to be shown for the flag more so than that love football\nPeople want respect shown for the flag Trump knew that he understood that and when he refers to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas\nHe knows that the left is going to jump into oh my gosh she's being a racist why Pocahontas was a historical figure we all know from the Disney movie which was by the way not one of the better Disney movies out there uh I was very ... and I'm somebody who really liked the early Disney movies of that era you know Lion King I beauty in the piece of great movie\nThe original or will the I guess on radio but the old school Robin Hood where he's a Fox so great it's a great\nCartoon if your kids haven't seen that one of my favorite cartoons cartoons used to be way better than they are now now there's a the cartoons that are making for kids these days\nBut he knows when he calls Warren Pocahontas they all go oh he's raised they jump on this but what what a lot of us who are just normal people who are not emotionally destabilize left is what we hear is why are they why are they defending Elizabeth Warren being called the\n... you know she's not a Native American right we all understand this so why do they act like this is some big slight against Native Americans the point is she's ... she's a phoney\nAnd Pocahontas is a very well known female Native American in in our history you know there are others but Pocahontas was probably the most well known I mean you could say she's not the most historically significant I'm sure I'm about to get an angry email from somebody\nAbout the coordination and how it was a matriarchal society and how they were the basis for our U.S Constitution\nAnd who there's some really interesting were vision is out there about a native peoples in America and how both technologically and politically advance their societies where or\nWhen you have not mastered the wheel or writing it is tough to claim I think that the European columnist we're taking much of\nTheir political system or you know I I you know you can call me crazy but but with the war in thing are we calling her Pocahontas\nAnd you'll notice that one of the themes we're hitting on the show the left deserves to be mocked love has to be ridiculed if they are taken seriously they ... when they're being an serious if they are taken seriously there's no way we ever snap them out of it\nOr they need to be mocked and ridiculed and and brought down a peg when they're acting this way on the in these positions on these areas because satire is a very powerful tool it's very powerful\nA there's a reason why we still know the names of people like\nSamuel Clemens AKA Mark Twain why we know the names of people like volt tear because of\nTheir ... was there to cheer ethical towers right and in their writing that were show timeless and and really resonated with people\nAnd you you must be willing satirized people like was before and must be going to point out the hypocrisy that the left has here\nAnd that that she's even being considered that she's being talked about by anyone\nTwenty twenty contender is just mind blowing [noise]\nIf your windows are hard to open and close our draftee or difficult to see out of then it's time to call renewal by Anderson for your free window diagnosis I met Mr and during my time as a TV home improvement host I've seen just about every window problem

radio seven ... tell me when GM oatmeal and I are it's radio station nine point nine W. I. max the H. G. three mobile\n[noise]\nHonest saying to the team player I leave ... Fox News this ceremonial swearing in France Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh at the White House fight\nHarshly criticizing the left during his confirmation hearing justice Brett Kavanaugh pledges to play it down the middle\nBut it's not getting your way traumatized as you if not having your politics reflected back to you constantly from the ... the United states is something that you have emotional difficulty dealing with\nHe's in our fair to say that you're not very emotionally well adjusted isn't it straight forward then to just point out that you got some growing up to do and he got some ... you got some ... as the kids would say to work through\n'em so I I just wanted to know the core Ocasio Cortez who was a darling of the left now refers to\nLeftists in her district as people who are having a psychological breakdown because of Trump\nI I'm not reaching what I point that out I'm not just basing it on their behavior and try to mock them all that's fun to hash tag owned the lives it's also the case that they recognize that this is really that left ism is now a psychological disorder in the era of Trump\nOr but that wasn't even the ... the silliest or or weirdest things you said I got to tell you I've always\nThere are some viral Internet clips uh that that are out there that you just never forget right there's the O'Reilly you know we'll do it live and it will do it live I mean you know and you can say that to somebody and they know exactly you can say those words will do it live and everybody knows exactly we're\nTalking about I mean that clip is it's timeless truly great uh there's also the maps like such as the Iraq and the south Africa like such as\nThat young woman you know very beautiful young woman and sprayed oh in it and it was the Miss America pageant a thinker miss team usa pageant or whatever it was\nAnd and she uh she got a little caught up in her answer and didn't really know what the heck she was saying and I know what that's like you know sometimes I've gotten really tired and an ... using the lovely young woman's ... of course right I'm using that whatever uh but I Know I caught myself\nBut Ocasio Cortez had a moment that reminds me of that I just wanted to play this for you there's so much here this was on MSNBC over the weekend this is the favorite new Congress Congress woman of the progressive left\nAnd here's the kind of stuff that she offers up in terms of her analysis of what's going on with the Congress this is going to be delicious play a clip on\nAnd you're also coming really as an outsider and among them watching people like for watching what happened today I'm On a storm the games are going to actually do that as well that's what's what's your plan [laughter] well\nI think a lot of rich holding our strategy around with that now there's a lot of baseball and inside the beltway as you say that turn out that there are very ... organizers will Congress and I get that organizers operate differently if for some kind of strategy\nLeery about organizing full\nAnd [laughter] work Oregon I Won some strategic in our late ... bring together a coastal strategy pressure on the shoulders of only focus on the pressure is fine but that's really interesting thought [laughter]\nJohn did you that's really interesting I Love groups have you just going to be a ... type style laughing [laughter] what do you rather that was straight out of the Mario Lopez playbook that quick 'cause she was like thank you very much ms tendency like she'll leave that to do this like deep voice announcer man big after like such as Matt\nOh cause you a court case that was\nJohn can you jump to the middle of that again just where she started talking about organizing can you do that 'cause I don't even know the whole thing again I just want to hear the\nOh okay well close enough\nYeah it's like organizing is like like so what's different about organizers is with the organizing is that they organized and like outside the box and you know close the loop on the organizing of the organizational and there's like the Congress with the organizers and they're just like so much of that\nStuff [laughter] she was I mean John I'm not being unfair right and that was one of the craziest word salads I've ever heard on television\nI think she was trying to find what you wanted to say yes that's right because she couldn't get to a point as very astute analysis I mean she she comes out\nAnd you're thinking to yourself like okay I kinda know where she's going she's a community organizer she wants to borrow the Obama playbook of you know community organizing isn't just a way of doing you know agitation at public agitation in pursuit of personal political\nUh goals right it's not just whipping people up into in ... style mob there's something more to it than that but then she just gets lost and she's ... she's she's looking for the articulate soundbite that's programmed into her mind because so much a progressive ism is really\nThis learn the language of trigger warnings and like hierarchy the patriarchy and victim allergy and white privilege and checking your privilege and there's this whole other lingo\nAnd these phrases that come with it and she's looking for the ... you know she's looking to lock into that but she got a little lost and then you realize like she's not really thinking about what she's saying you know this is like when Al Al Sharpton does it resists we much like the resist you know\nYou realize he's reading off the prompt or but he's not actually thinking about the words that he sang Ocasio Cortez had is uh R. E. S. P. I. C. T. we should keep that as a we should keep it as a drop job just to have for you know important moments like this R. E. S. P. I. C. T.\nThat was one of my favorites uh anyway\nYeah ... record says this is the the great\nThe great hope of progressive in this election is that she's a part of a crop of new insurgent left wing candidates who are pushing for\nA while I openly advocating for socialism catchy defined socialism now but like she has an economics degree a country defined Marxism\nNo 'cause she tell you much\nAbout marks or angles no\nBut she sounds right to the left and if you sound right and come from the right group right the right identity group they give you a tremendous amount of difference and that's what you see happening here uh I I Would just note that my fear\nAnd I I Know I'm On this and I'm now I'm going to be banging the warning drawing this way advanced and you're like buck come on ... great unbelievable jobs numbers everything's going so well and I agree and that's because of Trump 'cause of the Republicans that are in charge now and it's I think it's going to keep going for a while here is what I'm telling you though\nRight now we can mock the socialist and he's left us in the Democratic party because they sound foolish and we know their ideas are foolish and people are in a frame of mind or they will\nReason through it and understand you know anybody who is paying attention and knows anything you know are not limousine liberals and for people or people for whom politics is really just an emotional game and it's all about virtue signaling they just want to talk about how they're\nYou know ... Marxist and redistributing the wealth and everything 'cause it makes them feel good about themselves they don't think of the economic consequences\nMy concern\nIs that we are going to have a structural economic reset because of the debt and because of the accumulation particularly of\nCorporate debt load and you see that with all these these high you'll bonds that are ... and the corporate debt structures for some of these companies are never going to be able to actually make good on their obligations rising interest rates any massive\nUh well we have a trillion dollars student loan debt which is a problem I don't think it's catastrophic problem\nBut any of our ... trillion dollars of debt and you have rising interest rates and I just see that at some point you're going to have a cyclical reset and that's when all of a sudden when people really get ahead and unemployment checks up even if it's cleaning out the system in a sense even if it's just a necessary\nPart of the economic life cycle that's\nWhen people will be open to the idea of socialism in America not you not me but there'll be a much bigger swath of America wants to hear about free health care free college free this free that the rich will pay the ritual pay a and I think that day is coming\nI think that historically\nIf you just look back I think there's a a a historical cycle that we will we will enter into here I don't know if it's gonna be the next two years but it will occur in my opinion during the Trump presidency because I knew trumps any president for eight years\nThat we have to be on guard for and that's why the educating of the public on these issues of the economy and government interference in the economy has to happen now and we have to stay vigilant we can't just mock we have to also tackled the arguments on the left about socialism because when the time is right\nThis is important my friend okay [noise] ridiculing what should be ridiculed in the\nProgressive left [noise] he's not just a little sweetener the Trump throws in their free speech is we need more of this we medium to own the lives\nIs is a Bloomberg market minute last Thursday and friday the Dow is down about two hundred point well street didn't repeat itself the gal really thirty nine points after being down early in the day the NASDAQ down fifty two in the ass in the last just a point\nThe bond market with college for Columbus taste down suffered last week if treasury bond yields search to a ten year high that makes darling more extensive for companies in based on march ...\nThat's already acts like a studio in ... name now it's buying one that's like ... and final talks or a beach kill a facility in Albuquerque with eight sound stages where the adventurous and the cardio were made Netflix's chambers and ... already shooting Mexico and damage was also found in the state now we're down the price he\nTied to adding another desert to its menu many cinnamon rolls ... there Saturday an exclusive creation for the pizza chain that nation's restaurant in a sense they look identical to the bond by Santa Santa bonds shopping ...

C. would have to ... although I Will say it's a little confusing when I say I'm I live in Washington people were always like the state or you know DC\nYou know we should just call it D.C the district of Columbia shouldn't be Washington DC 'cause it gets confusing I Know that sacrilegious because our founding father blah blah but we got a state named after him as a lot of stuff named after him he's our dollar bill\nSo yeah Columbus doesn't call indigenous peoples anymore\nAnd I like to point out mostly because it upsets the left which is fun because we're we're owning lives were only lives hard these days folks freedom we embrace this because lives need to be own for their own good at this point\nThey they need people to show them that in in politics their ideology is at new level and they need to get wrecked\nNotice on dropping all the lingo John\nI used to know this stuff when I when I used to be playing video games I could use all the cool kids laugh when I was about to say you sound like a game or no yeah exactly I used to I got so good at ... I got it like this special level tournaments and fever I was playing kids in\nAll the from Shanghai to Korea to Rio de Janeiro and uh I was I was pretty nasty it a fee for anyway I was like ten years ago so Columbus Day people get all upset about because if they Columbus owned slaves and was a pill a jerk\nAnd to that I just point out why is it that we only judge and I know others are making this point you but I really I really do look at this 'cause that period of in the history of the fifteenth sixteenth century is a particular interest to me you had a massive\nMuslim slave trade going on in the America so put that aside for a moment you had a huge slave trade in the Islamic world of white Christians I Would know they were being created a slaves all over the place a lot of them\nA labor to death [noise] work to death or the women were putting the Arabs you could figure out what that was all about\nA that was going on millions of people over the course of a few centuries and so it's not like it was just the slave trade in in Western Europe although we're always led to believe that but then you get into the Americas and you read a little bit about particularly\nThe a Caribbean tribes or in you know native tribes and the as tech and into people's as well as all the tributary\nGroups below them and the Aztec Empire for example was a massive empire built on slavery human sacrifice and yes there was a lot of cannibalism\nThey were eating people\nAnd when they weren't eating them they were ripping they're beating hearts out of their chest because they thought that that's what their God wanted\nSo I Do think that there was a little bit of a need to you know a move up the the ethical civilization scale quite a bit so why don't we look on that at the same time period with any horror no we'll look on on Columbus and\nAnd apply the moral standards of today to back then well if we're going to apply the standards of today here's a point that you won't hear the left me Columbus was morally much more advanced than these civilizations he came into contact with in the new world and a dare I say in comparison to what he came across\nNews radio seven ten normal un P.
