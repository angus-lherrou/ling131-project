said it wasn't the dumbest thing this week and I present to you to prove me correct none other than Mr Don Lemon ... pie too\nI keep trying to point out to people not to demonize any one group or

did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know\nMost of them to get into the country most of them ... do you know got stuck it out before they even made it to the border um\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men most have been radicalized ... up to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them there is no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so what do we do about that\nThat's right folks multimillionaire CNN anchor\nSays we need to stop demonizing people Hama and understand that white men on the right or the real threat they're the real evil the real monsters maybe we should ban them from traveling\nI didn't make him saying I'm not

that the political rhetoric is bad because the other side is basically Hitler\nAnd I wasn't exactly how many how many references to rights and you know the rights that fires and not season or did you hear that opening montage\n\nThis is how they think about the other side and you know what it you know what it really drives a lot of this is the success\nOf the successes that Trump has and the relative failures of the eight years of Obama's and before\nIt or that they told us they being all the opponents to the Trump movement they told us that he would fail miserably that he was completely in over his head that he had no idea what he was doing\nAnd that we would all essentially they will be able to laugh at us as we all suffered the horrible consequences of having Donald\nTrump is president but you see we have\nSuffer the consequences of Donald Trump as president and suffering with things such as the lowest unemployment rate in sixty years the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rates of all time a booming economy a ton\nOf investment no massive foreign wars getting started no crazy foreign military interventions that are going to send our bravest and best Americans into harm's way for missions that the powers that be already been clear on how they're supposed to end and what's supposed to happen\nThat's that's\nThose are the consequences of Trump ism and now that we've felt that for two years now that we've seen it for ourselves there's a desperation on the left what does it say about the judgment of some of the most celebrated names in the\nDemocrat Party whether it's politicians or pundits or anybody with real power ... what does it say that they have been wrong wrong wrong\nAll they can do is criticized Trump's words his persona his attitude is tone\nA but they're not able to say oh look at this issue of look at this major policy issue where we're from either why do is lied to his supporters\nLied to his base or failed miserably no quite the opposite they they hate Trump more because he is successful they hate Trump more because he is by his ability to\nWithstand them and succeed\nDespite all their efforts he's in a front to the left very sense of self\nHe makes them feel insecure about their beliefs and on the left belief and politics are tied together\nIn such a way that the true believers the left wing zealots don't know who they are if they do not have their progressive virtue signaling they don't know who they are\nIf they can't believe that CNN is objective and the New York times isn't liberal and you know all the smart people all the good people vote Democrat\nIt rattles them in a way that people that view politics really just as a as a system for managing conflict in a in a civil society which is what I think conservatives that have a good perspective on this understand it to be a don't feel as\nShaken up right we see this is okay what are we getting how's it going what are the results we try to take a rational approach to it and and even if someone just passionate although I Can't say that's always the case\nI Do like it when Trump owns lives I find it very amusing I think it's very

get on the subject of is a burst right deal and if people are informed of the fourteen conch constitutional amendment it has nothing to do with illegal birthright yep\nOh I'm In it that in death coming up later on the show but just I guess that's kind of a U.S kind of a preview of the courts have never held that that is that that is the case\nThat illegal aliens no court has held that illegal aliens or should be given citizenship it's never been addressed by the courts before\nAnd when you really think about it that was clearly not the intent of those who wrote the amendment at Eighteen sixty six and why would that be the decision of the government now it makes no sense\nTo consider people who are foreign citizens meaning citizen of a foreign country who are not legally in this country who are supposed to be removed from this country as soon as they come into contact with law enforcement and our government apparatus\nThat their children should be automatic or their children born here should be automatic citizens that it doesn't make sense why would we do that\nIt doesn't make any sense it was formed to give the birthright to the ... children of slaves\nOr the ... year the fourteenth amendment was well as for it was for yet that the descendants of of slaves after the civil war was one and it was very explicitly for that purpose and it also at all no this later on it when you look at the way it didn't deal with Native American populations at the time and you know there's a lot of\nLegal ease here about the different jurisdictions and overlapping jurisdictions but it should be clear it's pretty amazing really that we'd gone this far without anyone challenging it\nAnd I think Trump is absolutely right if nothing else we should have clarity on the issue I mean we should at least have the court's wing in and explaining and and I think that the problem here Charlie is with the Democrats don't really understand\nIs that no matter what once again they are showing their chipping their their hand here and we're seeing the Democrats are in favor of\nIllegal immigration illegal aliens being in this country ah yeah they always take the side of illegals in every issue on every issue and Americans take notice of this\nI think I think our president is slamming it in their face\nYeah he has every right to do that yeah\nI think he's I think he's making the I think he's making them the right move on that so thank you very much Charlie for ... calling from Maryland ... even in Springfield, Massachusetts what's up Stephen\n... hey Mr ... the wisest one I I really enjoy your show your your your discussions are extremely thoughtful and I really appreciate that you're very kind on but the thing that they don't want to mention and it's believed that the thing of ties in with Don Lemon\nDa da da da da and towards white men is really their down towards losing working class voters\nOn and especially with the Trump presidency they've lost a lot of union ... this is their animals towards like working class voters but but but that's not really my main point on the ... thing I was wondering and wondering is on the ... this whole birther thing got me thinking about anchor babies when it comes to welfare\nOn date because there's a crisis of a caravan coming and then two more caravans after that caravan\nUm what ... what do you think the idea of Trump freezing brand new welfare applications in light of this crisis until this gets sorted out because one of one of my pet peeve destroy a long long time is that people don't understand that a white in his country means your\nYour ability and freedom to do something it is to wait to pound and a government desk and expect money\nWell in terms of welfare and and immigrants I can say that\nTechnically new immigrant including legal immigrants are supposed to be on welfare in fact in immigration law there's a there's a there are clauses about how you cannot be a a ward of\nThe state uh so you cannot be a dependent on the state and that they know and that's that's supposed to be the way that we're in our immigration system is set up as we know that's not the case\nWhat ends up happening is for example with the anchor ah the anchor baby issue once you have and as a child who is a is it given citizenship here to uh to illegal parents\nBenefits accrue to that child so then you start and and it goes to the household so essentially the benefits start coming in for that child and they have to go through the adults right you don't give a a a a two year old you don't give a newborn\nA government benefits you have to give it to the parents and ... so there are ways that families because they also will\n[noise] some people still think an education from northern Virginia

Wednesday em on ... radio [noise]\nThis is a perfect example what I'm Talking\nAbout here you have a guy who writes for the Washington Post Eugene Scott he he tweeted out to politifact today are are white males responsible for more mass shootings in any other group you hear this and and white males they also associate with the right even though there have been a whole bunch of mass shooters who are white males that were\nIf anything political leftist but you know that this is\nThis is what do you often hear I mean this is the story line this is the way that\nThey will uh they'll talk about all this um and\nYet when you start to break this down and say OK okay well let's take this guy the Washington Post ... let's let's think about this let's say white males are the majority of shooters in this kind of ... in this country\nUm\nTurns out that's not true it turns out actually mass shootings are essentially line up with what you would expect in terms of demographic representation\nA for all the different\nEthnic groups in this country but ah your ears would you find out\nThey've never mass shootings but I'm an overall violence overall violence now you get into a whole other conversation about some communities have a much higher rate of violence in other communities\nBut for mass shootings it's it's pretty evenly distributed um but Ninety five percent of shooters plus I mean probably more like Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of shooters might be Ninety nine are male so as a river that we're being told white males or the bad guys that we have to be worried about their the terrorists they're the real threat\nI'm Don Lemon says that's what that other guy was a radio show I've never heard of jazz Ninety nine percent of shooters are are male in this country the country's also\nSeventy percent white so if if let's say Ninety nine percent of shooters are male and a country is Seventy percent white but\nOnly fifty four percent of mass shooters or white then that means that there's a disproportionate representation\nUm of other groups that are not and why they're both issues so so what point do people at the Washington Post and other places I think they're really making about this I mean when I remember I said it's pretty evenly distributed but there's actually some\nThe outlier here is not that there are so many a white mass shooters in the country\nSo why are they pointing to that I mean I don't think they really want to go down this road I also think that looking at ethnicity when it comes to mass shootings is is a an irrelevant and and really pointless exercise but they'll laugh like to do this because I think of us all based upon our\nOr ethnicity as as a as an essential part of identity\nOr whether we agree with that or or not um\nThen you get to the terrorism side as an observer to make this brief uh that that the GED George mafia a moron from Charlottesville\nIs talked about so much in the media it just goes to show you that they they can't find where where's this these white nationalist I'm always hearing about I'm not saying they don't exist him saying how many are there really very very few\nAnd to refer to that as a rise of of real terrorism in the country and that's the biggest terrorist threat and people like that are people like this pipe bomber guy uh we don't have the TSA because of the pipe bomb or we don't have the national counterterrorism center\nAnd the multibillion now going on trillions of dollars are spent on a security apparatus for this country of all kinds because we're worried about right wing\nNationalist terrorism we have it because of Islamic radicalism are that lets the in the post nine eleven security apparatus we have is specifically designed to deal with the threat of radical Islam\nAnd I know that right now we're in a little bit of a low the terms of radical Islamic knock on wood radical Islamic attacks in the United states\nBut that doesn't mean that that's not the primary threat and people who say this garbage about how\nThe real concern the real terrorists threat the real threat of extremist violence comes from white nationalist\nA are being disingenuous and they don't know what they're talking about I Know that there are major a major departments and agencies that yes they do have a they do have you know some entities that deal with you know

radio then somebody went damn ball field and I urge radio station and a nine point nine ... dream of\nProve it is just it is just wild just while to see this happening and you know\nThat then there's also what I see from our own side and you know I've very frustrated with us today but not not surprising at all [noise]\nYou know I Know he's not running anymore but you'd think that after all the time it's been a concern circles and here's here's Paul Ryan not a constitutional scholar not a lawyer but then again neither am I but I seem to know more about this and Paul Ryan among many other things in a more about the Paul Ryan a but here's what he says that the fourteenth amendment just one this is\nA very clear political and yes partisan issue right before the election we can count on on on Paul Ryan speaker of the house to come forward and this is what he does play\nYou cannot and birth to ship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws ... current and following the plain text of the constitution I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [laughter]\nTom and that would involve a very very lengthy constitutional process where we obviously out only agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is among check illegal immigration\n\nThe fourteenth amendment is not clear in that the language when you look at the language leaves open room\nRight subject to the jurisdiction thereof as we've been discussing if your subject to a foreign ... if a foreign country can say hand that then that guy back over to us and we go okay he's yours\nWhich which jurisdictions he really subject to ...\nI mean you know this is where he started to get it okay well hold on a second and and also you know as an American when you're traveling in a foreign country if you're an American or you're traveling in France and and you're like a I don't want to pay any more American taxes\nWould you have to do when you live abroad by the way we do that in this country they don't do it in many other countries\nAre ... and you say well I'm only subject of French jurisdiction now because I'm an French ... a French French joy on French soil ah I'm always subject to do their jurisdiction we'll say none of your subject or jurisdiction so you're an American citizen I saw a jurisdiction has not just about geography\nAnd that's where this gets more that's what this gets more complicated and there are instances already where you could be born on us soil and you could even be are legally but you would not be a citizen right in the case of the sons of a insult us diplomats who were born here and they maintain their own nationality their own citizenship\nSo that's\nA place where there's no clarity it off the courts and just for Paul Ryan to pretend that he's opposed illegal immigration when he's pro DACA pro this huge huge increases in guest worker programs\nAnd has just been so wimpy end immigration for so long and for him when he's not running again to come out now and say this and just get a kick in the ...\nTo the G O P side I got to say I was I was pleased\nThat at least at least from was was willing to call him out on this one I mean it was good to see that are here we go Paul Ryan is from Donald Trump quote Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions about birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about\nNew Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes and securing our border\nPresident Trump is completely right I'm Paul Ryan look it's one thing that ... to come out and say look there's there's a lack of clarity on this and you know we had the courts need to take this up and it it is an important issue but that's not what he said he said you know it's pretty obvious that the left is right here that yeah that's right we want people to show up\nAnd go and stay in maternity hotel or whatever it's called birth hotels whatever that is when you show up and have a baby when you're a foreigner and the whole point is to get them citizenship here\nAnd you know birth tourism\n... that's clearly not with all that but you know Ryan just can't help themselves I he's the guy who clearly has all oh gee shocks I I think he is much more about Paul Ryan than he is about the party there I say and and that brings it back to how I don't accept this separation\nOf party and country because I think that the Republican Party is better for the country therefore I support the Republican Party\nIt's eight other bringing back to that formulation for a moment and then I just one other thing here for you I Want you to hear this is Joe Donnelly who's a who's running in the Indiana representative a or in the U.S senator other Joe Donnelly here's what he just said during the during the debate yesterday this is incredible liquid one\nWe want everybody to have a chance in Indiana and in America and my officers reflect that\nBoth on the campaign side and on the Senate side or state director is Indian American but he does an amazing job or director of all constituent services she's African American\nBut she doesn't even more incredible job than you could ever imagine [laughter]\nWhat the heck is this guy said I mean could you imagine if a Republican said I Know you misspoke but wow hey a producer Mike\nYou there oh All right well gosh bruise reminds you of cigarette break up a DJ brand it I just won't let you know that uh you're you're oh you're a white guy but you're pretty good at your job as what you do\nThat doesn't sound like much of a government does that bred banks I think I mean brand and you you your your name is Brenda you're a white dude but you'd be amazed at how good you are at running the board for this show people would be like oh\nYeah exactly\nSo this is what you get this this is the Democrats the best and brightest folks the Democrat Party senator\nJoe and Joe Donnelly this is this is what the other side offers up at the Republican did it that would probably be the end\nMake uncle\nWith all the recent news about online security

country that helps protect the citizens of America because they do not want to secure our borders they do not want to have a law and order country\nThe reason that we're in this predicament it's because Democrats in Congress had failed to do their job and the president's going to look at any way possible that he can find a legally unconstitutionally that to make sure that we're doing everything we can\nListen in a long standing debate there's good faith arguments on both sides so natural reading of this amendment which seemed to support unlimited birthright citizenship but the

the law and then\nBe well but we're not going to do in jury enforce ban and let's not being mean and what's not separate families and all the rest of the right to you can't have it both ways\nAnd they went up it both ways with immigration all the time they want to say they want a strong border but they don't want to enforce the law when it comes to people illegally crossing the border they say they want an orderly immigration system but they don't want to do interior enforcement is that it should be consequences violating the law but they don't want to know when they get prosecuted ... at home\nOr anything else right so yeah there's a classic and then with the constitutional aspect to it have to say\nThe only thing that amuses me more than ... discovering the constitution is wouldn't

we just didn't pay much attention to it because we you know how the really existential fight against radical Islamic terrorism going on but I I think that the president is from a purely political perspective\nMaking the right choices you're to show the difference what is the difference when it comes to immigration between the Democrats and Republicans and the Democrats don't want to fix anything they want to legalize more and more people that don't want the laws to be enforced they don't want a system that privileges\nOf those who will bring special skills and be a more easily able
