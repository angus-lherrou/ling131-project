to time so when my mom always Nineteen and my daddy we want they want\nSo sure enough war and put out a video today about all this stuff\nAh Elizabeth Warren decided that the best thing for her to do would be to actually create some kind of a a little propaganda film for herself where she would have different members of her family and they're different people all involved in this and I\nFeel I feel like there should be some degree of\nOf embarrassment here\nOr there should be some oh my gosh what am I doing but then again when you when you look at what's really happening on ... across the board right now with with the media and with the effort to take down Trump anything is acceptable as long as it is for\nThe cause I mean anything is going to be considered okay here as long as it is a evidence or useful in the anti Trump cause\nI just I I've reached a kind of a new a new level here and a new degree of understanding of just where the media is taking all this stuff and and what they're willing to do and what they're willing to put the American people through a in terms of\nPropaganda and and the whys and there's no way that a normal person could have read that Boston Globe report today\nAnd come away from it with anything other than wow that is a massive mistake that Warren has made here and she's clearly not Native American she never should have claimed to be Native American there's nothing about her that justifies this notion of being Native American\nAnd yet you know all I see right now on the on the front page of CNN here's a perfect example\nI see nothing in their main headlines is all about the Saudi guy got which we'll talk more about your mark show you later but nothing about that you go down one two three four five six seven\nEight eight stories down the CNN front page right now and you get quote Warren's DNA never mattered Trump\nOr how how this Trump's fault in one world is that is the takeaway here that Trump isn't a you know accepting her DNA results or something\nThese people are insane they really are I I ... or there it's just impossible for them to be a ... embarrassed here's another eat another version Huffington Post Trump denies this is their top story about this\nTrump denies making charity pledged tied to Elizabeth Warren DNA test Trump shed and was it was very specific Trump said that if she made it through\nThe primaries and is the Democrat and now the knee and then and then she proves that she as Native American heritage in that case will get a million dollars to repair a charity so that's what he said okay he denies what they're saying he said which is he would just give her a million dollars if you Bruce you Native American\nAnd not even is not the point because\nIt she Native American everybody's Native American\nAnd anyone who's trying to be honest anybody who's looking at this and the perspective of I Would like to really present the facts and and get to the truth year would automatically understand I vicious just\nPathetic it is absolute nonsense that I'm seeing here from all these different all these different sources the way that they're covering this I mean they're they're trying so hard to actually cover is the right word because they're really covering for Warren\nAnd this is because what they think happy\nToday is uh that would they didn't happen today is that she's no longer really going to be a serious contender for twenty twenty\nThis is laughable she's a clown she's a joke\nShe's a joke she should be at least\nHere's ABC News which is supposed to be unbiased Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results on Native American ancestry a Trump says quote who cares\nThat's their headline that's the headline that\nShe this is a perfect case of media bias or where they think that they're progressive great hope for twenty twenty is in jeopardy right now because of her\nOwn just bone headed stupidity I mean this is just on cinco de dum on think of lead them\n\nAntifa are you guys ... right I used to be a big thing\nI used to get a lot of media attention at least conservative media would sometimes talk about the left doesn't seem to want to talk about them that was some audio that we play for you or the latest and the incident out on the uh\nI don't do it as well as Trump Trump's antifa is better than my energy for uh but I don't do it as well as he does\nOut on the west coast in Portland which strikes me as a strange place for that it'd be quite so much\nPolitical extremism but but that's I suppose it is what it is right that is going on there\nUm but and you got these people with with the cheaper group that were squaring off against some I think it's called the group for patriots in prayer or something I forget exactly even what the\nWhat the group was called um I mean do a quick refresher on that one but you know you sure enough you had you had this uh this violent\nIncident where your protesters and counter protesters your ego bears spray\nAnd bloody brawls at patriot yeah patriot prayer law and order march in Portland\nYou have to be very careful my friends when you see the way that these kinds of stories are covered you have to pay really really close attention because there's a lot of a political\nThat goes on there's a lot of usage of kind of weasel words and what they leave in what they take out these descriptions for example just\nBecause the ACLU and by the way I Know nothing about this patriot prayer I Can't keep up with all the other group it's called patriot prayer and has a lot of American flags sounds cool to me but I don't know that could be wackos I have no idea there too many of these little you know local political groups for me to know every single one of them\nBut I just would I Would caution you all at the ACLU is not a reliable source at all\nOr I'm Sorry ... Southern Poverty law that the truth of the ACLU as well so yes you keep that keep that in\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center is not a reliable source when it comes to deciding who is a a a political extremist or a right wing extremist a white nationalist any any of those things you cannot trust the Southern Poverty Law Center it has become a massive\nFundraising organization and a left wing really a left wing hate group and a lot of cases\nIn any group that has to pay a multimillion dollar settlement too much it was a for being an anti Muslim extremist when he's a Muslim is a group that you probably want to take with a grain of salt whenever it comes to these uh these different demonstrations and and how they're reporting on who's there and what's going on so that that's one part of it\nBut then there's the other which is just\nThis idea that it is a normal thing to want to show up and do these counter protests and they call them counter protests but when people show up to a demonstration right and they're all wearing black and they have gas masks and shields and and and homemade weapons\nThey're not showing up because they want to engage in a battle of ideas they want to engage in a battle\nThey want to fight people and\nThe fact that they showed up with their spray and these other things tells you all that you need to know uh but I just think it's so interesting which media outlets will and will not covers this makes for really compelling footage\nThis is a story that you'd think they'd want to tell you have a almost entirely white by the way antifa radicals who are attacking this this patriot prayer group over there they're called the law and order group rather they weren't a march for law and order\nI I've got an I've got to wonder is is that just stay is that a euphemism are they actually white nationals I I mean I have no idea and I know that I Can't trust\n'em I I Can't trust the media to produce honest assessments of this and tell us what really happened for example do just that they accept that there are counterprotesters and that you know the kind of project is just like showed up and like they didn't want any problems man but you know\nThere were problems well\nMaybe it's because they showed up and the whole purpose of their presence was to ignite some kind of a confrontation right\nYou get any game in ... you know ... you\nKnow they're showing up and they're screaming about fascism and from being a Nazi and they wanted they want to hit people and they want to attack people and they want to do these little home videos of this because these are radical their political radicals\nAnd you know you could argue that the only thing that really separates him from a domestic terrorist organization is that to date antifa has put a limit on the degree of their violence right they have not engaged in to my knowledge I might be getting something lethal action against them but they have engaged in violent action\nAnd keep in mind that that violent action if you have a very different very different political circumstances that could escalate it could escalate rather rapidly and all of a sudden a group that has issued lethality in the past\nWhen it comes with violence may maybe in a position where they feel like that is open to them and in fact that's\nThe path way that they take so I I Would just note that that's something that that I Want everyone to be aware of the ... has not been to this point\nA group as engaged in straight up terrorism it used to be that the anarchists to remind me a lot of antifa or the anarchists in this country we're the real terrorists I mean the ... the sort of what I mean real terrorists I mean they were the primary terror threat they were the ones who are assassinating presidents tried to blow up a stock exchange\nThat's right it was anarchists not Islamic radicals\nThere was another incident by the way I I Know I Would get hit if I didn't bring this one up there was another incident on a friday in New York City actually right in the neighborhood I think\nWhere I grew up in fact when I looked at the videos I could tell even the videos didn't show you much what street I think they were on when they had this fight a there was this ... this group that the Proud Boys and I've never really understood\nOh who they are or what what they are I I heard that they have they have some I should actually probably just call Gavin McGinnis and ask\nYou the metropolitan Republican club invited the Proud Boys\nAre which is called it quote right wing fraternal organization in this in this one piece from reading and there were two or three counter protesters that were beat up now\nI don't know I wasn't there and I haven't seen much I've only seen a little bit of footage but were these counter protesters who were just there to have a discussion I I think if you show up ... if you think that these are right wing radicals which obviously the counterprotesters do\nYou show up at one of their events\nAre are you planning to antagonize them and try to incite a confrontation or you really just want to share your thoughts do they think that they're going to scare the proud\nBoys I mean this is\nVisual ... that's the question what are they really doing that [noise]\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to

Fox News Saudi Arabia\nConducting its own investigation into the disappearance of journalist ... went missing three weeks ago at this sounded consulate in Turkey\nStill is true ah and maybe maybe Trump was just being offhand maybe it was just kind of messing around I have no idea I've no idea I Will say this\nIn my experience and I mean some of my personal experience the generals who are well or really well thought of by the media\nTends to be\nPeople who won cultivate a certain persona with the media and to also or as a little more\nShall we say willing to take a\nA point of view that would be well received\nBy academia and the media on a whole bunch of things I've noticed is before generals starting to get very political and journals like we love is this tremendous I have no idea I'm just saying that I'm aware of this as a phenomenon of that for example\nA lot of the stuff that came out of a general betray us I was not surprised by it all 'cause I had known for a long time that he was a a a guy who was seeking out the media and very much trying for his own\nPurposes to to create this narrative of portray us as the the greatest military mind at the generation I Would I Would just point out that before even are being brought low\nBy the extramarital affair and the woman and a classified information that he didn't do it all the stuff that you already know about and he had to plead guilty and pleaded guilty\nOr you know he he was credited with fixing Iraq which yes the surge work but it was really are\nA hundred and fifty thousand troops and people that were on the front lines that fixture rock but his strategy was successful there but there were some very important ingredients that were in place for that strategy to work I Would note that the strategy that he tried in Afghanistan did not work\nWas not working and was never going to work\nAnd he was not really willing to hear about how that was the case so while I I think on the one hand you know he gets all of this credit for Iraq well if he gets all those credit for Iraq we also have to look and see the situation Afghanistan I understand that he's not that portrays was not this\nUm men beyond reproach when it came to his ... certainly not beyond reproach period but also when it came to the strategy\nSo that's much more of saying I Need to do a little more I Need a little more analysis of what's going on here with or without ... that caught me off guard because I've heard so much positive stuff about matters for so long\nMaybe he just rub the present the wrong way recently and he just wanted to call him a Democrat I also this kind of funny that the president uses calling somebody a Democrat is kind of a a little sly a you know ...\n... s guys kind of a Democrat you know it's like when I say my uh my media life my guys okay it's kind of a communist\nSo Trump's as a kind of a Democrat he also said that you know that Trump said that he does not trust everybody in the White House and this is this falls into that category of oh my gosh the palace intrigue here\nYou know we we we need to we need to make sure that we run all these stories about Trump can't trust the people around him and there's all this stuff about how Trump is you know\nUnable to manage and he's bringing in all these people that don't have the right requirements and backgrounds and skills and everything else they love the White House dysfunction stories and anything that plays into that we tend to hear a lot about a so\nThen I take a step back and I say hold on a minute given what we know about all the different leagues and all the people that are in the White House including Republicans\nWho are holdovers from the Bush I shouldn't say from the Bush administration but from the Bush era of the Republican Party people that are not on board with Trump but all we know that there's somebody right now who roads if you if you believe in New York Times and\nI don't take that for granted but if you believe in New York Times there is a senior White house administration official right now\nWho wrote an op ed effectively saying that we're working against the commander in chief behind the scenes to for his decision making to act like he's not really the president and to go to these\nIf you go to these extreme lengths because we know what's best for the country we will undermine the express will the American people through their elections because we know better\nAnd that's really the position that's really what they're that that's really what they're they're saying about that and this guy wrote this editorial we never found by the way the uh non editorial as we never found out of this guy was the anonymous\nEditorial writer but then of course Trump of course Trump shouldn't trust everybody in his White House of course the ... to do that and that's also why I I give him more leeway than I Would in other circumstances and maybe you can say that's a little bit of you know self justifying\nHere are that's convenient not self justifying ah but I understand why he wants to have family members around because he feels like at least he can trust them and if your Trump and you've seen what's going on with a lot of not just the opposition but the people that are\nOstensibly supposed to be on your side of the fence people who are ... opposed to be Republicans helping you out you know your your battle buddies so to speak and how many of them have become turn coats on it how many Republicans have we seen including people with some pretty decent\nRecognition within party circled I mean you talk about like Bill Kristol the Weekly Standard and conservatives right wing or whatever you want to call them that have openly said yeah I'm actually just not even opposing trumpeting Moore I'm a Democrat in that kind of an environment which is the environment President Trump is in\nI think it would be insane\nTo the president's a trust everybody in the White House of course he doesn't trust ever in the White House this reminds me of some of the politicians that I've I've been able to interview the last few months and\nI Love when they do the you know OK off the record and I'm like\nYou're not telling me anything that's really some of them you know that something you know to me it's really off the record what they're doing is saying off the record to create the facade of you know I'm really giving you some access and inside here and I'm trying to build this report\nAnd then they say things that if I were to violate off the record which I never would but if I were to violate off the record it would make them look even better you know the like off the record I volunteered at a soup kitchen last weekend and save some puppies from a burning building\nLike is that really does that does that really has to be off the record senator so and so I guess\nSo ah and then\nYou know the the one that really contentious exchange the really contentious exchange that Trump had here with Leslie stall in this interview uh had to do with immigration because I think that is the one area where the left and the the media allies that they have\nHave felt like they've been in the strongest position or since the summer to just just pound Trump on this and what I think is so so fascinating here is that still the same thing they always do well it's your policy it's your policy to separate parents from children the border you did it it's on you it's your fault\nAnd Trump's has but no it's the law and I don't think\nThat they even I don't think he's media critics even really understand that to say that it's\nThe law is to say that it's actually the Congress that does bear some of if not the lion's share of the responsibility for this whole situation that that that that the Congress is either a napped or cowardly or for whatever reason just unwilling to do what they're supposed to do in these circumstances\nWhich is\nTo find a way to adjust a law that it's a bad law or\nTo repeal it entirely\nIsn't really the president's role I mean this is how much damage I think Obama did to the rule of law as a concept it became normal during the Obama administration\nFor him when he felt frustrated with Congress ... all ... all I can I Do and what about the sorry\nOr he would go around them and do this whole executive order routine which was an abuse of executive orders because what he was just doing was usurping the legislative branches authority and pretending the laws were what he wanted them to be and saying well it's just about enforcement is not just about enforcement when you don't enforce something at all\nIt's not just about enforcement when you exempt an entire class of people that are explicitly not exempted\nBy Congress and I think that's\nPart of this that just immediately that the the press puts aside pushes aside and they really assume I mean they really thought that they would\nUh they would be in a place where Trump and the Republicans would just get hammered\nImmigration they would be or they would be just crushed because of what I've been going out of the border and I think that they miscalculated\nThat for a lot of Americans enough is enough they don't really want to keep being told that you know immigrants or do jobs or whatever and illegals now folks not immigrants illegal immigrants do the jobs Americans won't do that illegal immigrants are nothing but a net positive for the economy\nAnd they would like to have some re establishment of\nThe rule of law when it comes to the border and I know that Trump has and build the wall yet and there's a lot of stuff that remains a remains to be done and I have a lot of concerns or whether it will even happen especially if the Democrats take the house\nBut all this on this issue of the border you can tell lovely so she just wants to oh the parents being separated from their children happen under Obama it's a law that still on the books that was the law when

October twelve the correction posted in October fourteen here's the NBC News correction and earlier tweet missed identified the general President Trump described as incredible at a rally in Ohio it was general Ulysses Grant not\nRobert elite and attach to video clip lacked the full context for Trump's remarks years the full clip now this is where you have to start playing the game probability\nIs it likely\nThat all of these major media corrections could be due to good faith error in covering the president or is it more likely that what we see happening here is a trumped arrangement syndrome as it plays out\nIn the media in front of all of us all the time\nWhich of those things is the more likely scenario I mean I I think you really do have to ask the question and the answer is obvious the press is dare I say on a jihad\nAgainst the president United States they will\nTake any opportunity to try to tear him down and try to add one more data point into the narrative that he is racist that he's evil that he's a bad guy\nAnd this is also compounded by the incentive structure that we have in in the media in general right now where the initial lie get twenty thousand retreats or you know a hundred thousand ... and then the correction gets two hundred\nAnd so you get the benefit of of all that traffic of all that attention because now in the digital Arab media you really are measuring it down very precisely you know how many people read this how many people are going to your site how many people saw this you get all the upside and your audience gets what they want\nAnd then if you have to correct it OK well turns out you know that was amiss fire but your audience is never mad at you for bashing from when the correct I mean this audience would be but\nIf you're NBC if you're MSNBC or CNN if you're any of those networks audience doesn't turn on you for that they understand what you're trying to do they know that you have bigger things\nIn mind they know that you have a you know\nOther things that you're trying to do trying to take down the price of the United states that's gonna be a\nDifficult thing difficult thing to do and you're going to you're going to have some Mrs if you're doing that right so that's that's\nJust it's just an more the media malpractice that we keep seeing and that's why when the president calls them fake news when he says things like you know they they are fake news and they get so upset if they want him to stop calling them fake news maybe they should stop being fake news\nYou know if they would like the president on stage to no longer\nA push back on them for the obvious partisan smears in their partners in campaigns well then my recommendation to them would be that ah you know we shouldn't is that they shouldn't act in this way\n... you know do you think any of them will will apologize when Beto O'Rourke loses by ten or eleven points which is going to or do you think any of the pollsters any of the meeting people that a month ago or something it's going to be a really close race with Pedro and Ted Cruz they're going to come out and say may call but I don't think so\nBecause their their activists\nOnce you understand that their activists then you realize that there's none of this is even a little bit surprising anymore none of this is as a shock and and then you know then you could at least anticipate their next with ...
