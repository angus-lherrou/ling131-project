studies women and gender studies we called the bags\nAt Amherst College where I went\nI took a wax class that was interesting uh it was actually Islamic constructions of gender so I took a class on a women's engender studies class on Islam who wants to guess how critical of of\nThe Islamic faith the women's in gender studies professors willing to be the answer is not really at all\nSomehow women are treated better according to the class in Pakistan and they are in America I don't know how we got there but that's that's how that's how they thought you know the burqa freeze women they would say

have the same rights and we don't change the law based on whether we like or don't like somebody and\nThat makes you in in today's day and age that makes you a radical conservatives according to the

where someone to blame for all of their frustrations and shortcomings in life that there's\nThere's some reason some reason that is not of their own making up their own doing that their life is

the information you listen to news radio seven ten WNPR ... radio [noise]\nPresident Trump last week said\nIt is a scary time for men\nAnd in response a singer songwriter named Lindsey lab Stewart out of Texas wrote a parody song that statements I suppose we could say it's a scary time for women according to a her assessments but ah here's look she's got she's she's talented here's out some of the goats plate\nMaiden name when I get in on maintaining a man named King Live and\nI Can't use them in cages and again when you might end in Ninety and anger in Maine man and then again\nAnd again and again you know you're not painting\nOkay now\nAs I said they're nice voice obviously has some talent political analysis was not one of them\nA few things she said\nAbout any people say oh buckets art and she was running okay but she's this is a parody song she's making a political point so I'm dealing with it as a function of politics and she's responding to what the president said about how scary time to be a man she says things like\nIt is or rather ... you can't have the windows open when you're a woman home alone no if you live in an unsafe neighborhood I maybe maybe you feel that way but that seems a bit extreme I'm considering also that America is at the\nNow the bottom end of a fifty year decline in violent crime I I think that that's a little that's a little bit extreme but and then you say that you can't go to the bar without a chaperone\nWell I Know a lot of women and having a lot of women in my day and let them go to the bar without a chaperone\nAnd I know plenty of women who wear miniskirts all the time and or would feel free to wear a mini script whenever they chose to not feel weird about it and plenty of women who if somebody slid into ATMs when someone DM somebody else on Twitter or you know writes them on Facebook or who would say whatever they felt like saying\nSo why are we being told that these are all things that women can't do\nWhy make these claims that are ridiculous Clinton\nNow that's not to say that bad things don't happen\nTo women every day across the country and there aren't bad men out there who perpetrate horrible crimes somewhat of of course we all know that that we're we're having we're trying to have an adult conversation here we're not having a conversation about oh you're saying that there is no this is what the left those are you saying sexual assault is it a problem of course of\nIt's a it's a heinous crime a felony for which people are severely punished as they should be\nBut there's a hysteria and this is what I'm really trying to get out with the lyrics in this song and the way that the media talks but there's there's this hysteria among\nLeftist feminist rape culture on campus rape culture as there is no Rick culture on campus rape is a is a horrible crime it's illegal in all fifty states and is prosecuted vigorously\nUh so what where is this coming from\nAnd I mean the truth is that the same identity politics to be very divisive view of day to day life the Democrat Party takes about all groups of different ethnic groups and religious groups also applies to the sexes\nIt also applies to the way that the left views the role of women or the the the ... if you will the the position of women in American society and it's just not in keeping with reality\nAnd that is very troubling because once again we have this problem of how do you engage with the other side when you can't agree on the underlying foundation of what is real and what is not how old are you in gauge the other side\nOn issues like women walk around dressing hello I'm here in DC I live in their ... this is this is not the Taliban version of America would walk around dressing however the water as they will showed\nAnd women are\nVery safe in this country by the numbers compared to what what would be the case in a ... a lot of other places all over the world\nAnd and there's something inherently that feels a little\nUh on just about cleaning publicly in this way\nAnd it's not just the singers are this this is common among the ... that that that men especially men who will say things like well rape cultures admit that we don't care about these issues that is a slur that is a slender just not true\nWhy did they go there um because quite honestly they've been fed lives and they believe these lies they really do think that one in five women are sexually assaulted\nOr because of some campus surveys that were done when that is not true unless you include unwanted looks as sexual assault which is what was included in some of those surveys\nOr so the facts don't line up with this but facts in this and with many other things make liberals uncomfortable and so they prefer to exist it as much as possible and emotion

Sarah Fox news hurricane Michael a dangerous category three storm it's now two hundred and fifty five miles south of Panama City Florida is\nReality of the U.S ambassador position is that it's a two un is is that it doesn't really make that much difference why people are so focused on it now\nIs that Nikki Haley is an interesting political figure in the Trump orbit she's obviously female she's a half South Asian and so she has a mind you know people don't think of her as a minority female she is a minority female or you know she has minority female\nUh in her background or rather she is by background or minority female\nUm she's also liked by the establishment people think that Nikki Haley is in that circle of Trump Administration officials who are not surprises Judy the beltway swamp types\nRight I mean there's there's ... there's Nikki Haley um there's trying to think of who else would be you know you think of who who would be in the rules are in now in any administration that's going to the game you can Play Doh Kelly is chief of staff I mean there there's some people but certainly\nAre well within what your expectations would be for the role that they have\n'em but the Trump Administration is non\nTraditional and that is included a lotta nontraditional appointment but so Haley fits into that circle of people that are thought to be\nEstablishment approved a and so\nWhen she left initially when she announced her resignation there was a moment of oh my gosh what does this mean\nAnd as I said I don't think it means very much at all\nI think that she served two years she's on good terms with the president and from what we know all of his chief policy folks\nOh that was gonna say pumped but I I I don't think pumped pale would have been secretary of state and another British ration but he's\nA former congressman he's a somewhat establishment figure I think compares great but you know he's somewhat of an established needs a Tea Party congressman I Know but still um\nBut I don't think ... this matters all that much people find it interesting because the dynamics between Trump and\nAnd and Haley and the others in his cabinet who were thought of as being very Trump be whereas Nikki Haley is not but I think Trump season is increasingly I've always thought it's a compliment but increasingly now it's really an honor effect right it's it's a title that guys being trumpeted\nMeans is kicking button taking names so whilst\nThey focus on Nikki Haley today oh was the big story oh my gosh Nikki Haley's up\nBecause there's thought in the GOP that Nikki Haley is the most likely post Trump GOP nominee\nNow let's just pull that down to earth for a moment here uh does anyone really know what the political climate is going to look like in six years never mind in in you know in in ... or in in in two years never my six answers now you got no idea I Am I absolutely\nCertain Trump is going to win reelection down but I'm pretty certain um but Nikki Haley as a woman\nCertainly fits into what all these political journalists like to do it would just come up with a narrative that will interest people with speculation which I've told you before is the favorite tool now of the TV pundits and the different twenty four seven cable news networks Phil lots of speculation smoke filled the airwaves with speculation and\nYou know you'll you'll ah never have to worry about\nContent you'll have plenty speculation is easy and cheap and so that's why we do it and look it happens a lot on this but it was like oh I think so and so it was going around oh I think someone's like part of is that it's fun right speculations also following it can be interesting and just not worth all that much but they're saying that Nikki Haley may run\nOn the honest with you I don't know I don't know you know\nNo one knows well that's for sure but I\nI don't see that she's necessarily\nI'm quite as a compelling a Kennedy because here's here's what the would you always gotta remember in these situations\nAre side doesn't get credit for breaking the glass ceiling our side doesn't get credit for oh this person is incredibly accomplish and a minority you know in fact what is said about those were either minority or female and the conservative side who achieve high office in government is that they're sellouts that their traders\nTraded of their race straighter to their gender or whatever it may be a lot of that was said for example about college because of her vote on Kavanaugh that she was a a a gender traitor which I suppose is is now he's saying\nUm but I think that uh you know Nikki Haley step aside today and it was a slow news day answer everybody got all frenzied about this and I'll just let the former or soon to be former U.S ambassador United Nations is speak for herself on this one of them we've got a lot of other things that will be getting into political twelve\nI'm not leaving at the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that

I think you have to be blamed for knocking down when you\nFound in someone else to do the job [laughter]\n\nYeah there you go pardon on good terms reputation intact didn't have some big or injure personal blow up with the administration that's why she's leaving folks I Wish I could tell you there was some crazy or stories and that and if there is also that you know but for now\nIt is what it is Nikki Haley's heading out\nDoesn't really matter who cares [laughter] that's\nMy analysis of it I Know a book no what are you doing uh but I Do\nWant to spend a little time of the on the midterms because there is a a scrambling for narrative on the left and it does tie in so much with Nikki Haley said there and her little statement which is it's a great Dane America the concern I have for the Republicans go into these midterms is that things are so good\nRight now kind of me so strong we aren't fighting massive wars taking daily casualties abroad and countries we have no hope of ever reconstructing and\nCreating permanent stability in and would that that's not now I Know we're still in Afghanistan but we're not losing people every day we we don't have a hundred hundred and fifty thousand troops\nServing in these countries are serving in war zones and\nOverall things are really good right now\nOr the media the major means ... but that can be a problem for us because people don't vote when they're happy they vote when they're upset\nThat is a concern for me I Want to I Want to address that and also just the overall narrative from the left to go into these midterms that's going to come up and just a moment make um\nIt is more expensive to carry credit card balances credit card dot com reports the average credit card interest rate to Seventeen point zero one percent that is up from sixteen points Fifteen Percent a year ago Jeff ...

that's them up if we can't agree and this was a CNN\nAnd I'm not we're not going to play that clip today I'm going to let it\nJust uh 'cause 'cause I I like the I like the person on a on a person to person level who who said this stuff but she's been subjected obviously to this kind of thinking too much and has unfortunately bought into it at some level if we can't agree\nThat the people that are changing Ted Cruz at a restaurant or the people that are public officials were laughing about Rand Paul almost being beaten to death on his front lawn because someone didn't like what Rand Paul stood for a ... if if they're going to laugh about that\nIf they're going to go on TV is senator Hirono did and said well you know this is just what happens sent meaning that people should yell at others and get up in their faces anything else\nIf they're going to say that that's OK and that's normal we have no choice but to own the lips are only choice becomes victory the only response we can have two this insanity\nIs to defeat them and do it and I don't know how else to say to enforce our political will through the system legally and legitimately upon them that's it that is the ... that is the only option there is no other option you know people who think that a gathering of angry loud\n... it gathering an angry loud activists in a restaurant yelling at somebody and you know in front of his or his wife or her husband or whatever\nUh but there's not a huge emphasis in some of these European countries of the left points to a there's not a huge emphasis on\nThis state enforcing the same outcomes for all people right I mean some people do better than others maybe not necessarily economically but some people just have happier life outcomes some people there's only so much the state is able to do\nIt unless you empower it to a point where it's so powerful that you no longer have any individual rights you have whatever the state Danes to leave\nYou um but I suppose I'm getting too deep into this rabbit hole a\nHere's what I Would say about oh wait we've got more so Trump will actually say what needs to be said here which is that Hillary's a loser to time loser for president never really done anything impressive and her entire career has just been writing her husband's coattails\n'em and crumble said other people right the Romney wing of the GOP the Romney wing of the GOP is much more\nWilling to sit back and take these nasty comments from people like Hillary Clinton much more willing to sort of take the the underhanded and unseemly an unfair critiques without punching back in any meaningful way\nSo a Trump is a new era for conservatives and many of you listen to the show ... many of you saw that very very early on I have not just come around to it now I I consider\nMyself to be a a warrior ideologically for the Trump way of doing politics um he said things like you get tired of winning we're certainly not tired of winning\nBut that's not just a slogan you win or bad things happen I mean if you believe for example\nThat the Democrats pursue immoral policies which certainly in the case of a roe v Wade and there are other things you could power right on top of that then there is something of a moral imperative to do at least everything you can within the political system to prevent them from having the power to enact there will\nAh but Hillary has gotten in the past as we know from the media for very long time\nThat CNN sit down they sent a crusty on on one pool that Christie on whatever\nThe name is sit down with her I just said her name's obviously I ... I just don't like to say though because\nOf course it's ... the ah not Christine it's ... and she told the front of my uh\nBut they'll call it he'll call Hillary out you don't sit there and and just allow or to get away with the lives and the nonsense but on the issue of Bill Clinton's sexual harassment 'cause we're in this me to moment and everyone's\nAll focused in on how you know Kavanaugh in the Arab meat you was going to affect women's perceptions going into the midterm elections and all that stuff\nOn a porous jewelry about her husband Bill Clinton what went on here and I I Want to play the answer for you and then I Want to bring us down to a brass tacks place\nAnd he said either talk about the difficulties that your husband went through the U.S who obviously you're going to be prepared to have questions about that moment in Nineteen Ninety eight the impeachment um the allegations of sexual harassment against your husband or your pet to answer those questions that have ... to them and how do you see that\nSimilar or different from what President Trump is being accused of and ... and others today\nWell there's a very significant difference I and\nThat is the intense\nLong lasting part of an investigation that was conducted in the nineties [noise]\nIf um you know the Republicans starting with President Trump on down a one to a comparison nation welcome such an investigation themselves\n\nIsn't that an incredible sleight of hand from a dishonest and dare I say only ...\nPolitician\nOh there's a big difference alright between what happened with Kavanaugh and what happened with Hillary Clinton's husband Bill Clinton one is that his misdeeds\nOccurred while he was president of the United states or\nIn the case of the credible accusations of rape on the record by women he did have sexual interactions with who did know him worth seeing him there was no question about where they were or did you ever actually occur in terms of the date and time and could they have been there all the things that we never get answers for Ford\nBill Clinton was accused of rape by Juanita broader Roderick by he was accused of sexual assault by Jennifer Flowers and these women came forward and said that he was a\nPredator a predator and\nSure enough Hillary not only didn't divorce him didn't you know you say that those women should be believed she went on often against those women\nThe difference is not the investigation between cabin all and Clinton the difference is that one of them actually\nIs a predator and the other or the Democrats tried to sue me or as a predator that's the difference but Hillary is show dishonest and so disgraceful that you think she can get away with well one was a long investigation and the other you know there wasn't\nOne of them was being investigated forty did while president or well governor of Arkansas the other was being being accused of stuff and when he was Seventeen year old kids thirty six years ago\nBut it still thinks she can hit hit back at Trump for quote demeaning women play\nWhat was done last night in the White House with a political rally it further undermined the image and integrity of the court [noise]\nUm and that troubles me greatly it saddens me because our Gish all ... and ... has been viewed as one of the main pillar of our constitutional government so\nI don't know how people are going to react to it I think given our divides it we're pretty much fall predictably between those who are for and those who are against\nWhat the president's been true to form he has insulted attacked demeaned women um throughout the campaign really for many years leading up to the campaign and he's continued to do that or inside the White House\nYou know who else has has demeaned and insulted women folks Hillary Clinton when it suited her and you know what else was true and also said here on this show no ... going to be in trouble as long as the\nFeminist left in this country embraces Hillary Clinton the feminist left cannot credibly there's that word claim to really be about empowering women [noise]\nEvery day I have the incredible honor and privilege upbringing you my thoughts you're on this program but I Want you to have\nA platform to call your own I Want you to be able to go to a place and share your thoughts post photos engaging topics that matter to you you share your thoughts and ideas with like minded patriots across the country that's worsening the dot com comes [noise]\nThey'd be dot com is a new social media sites it's completely free and it does not have\nAny bias washed or whether it does\nNot have any of this left wing conversational health nonsense it goes in skewed toward the progressive side of things Snoopy dot com is all about letting you be you and yes online that means being conservative if that's in fact you are\nSo go and starting to count totally free everything about her free S.
