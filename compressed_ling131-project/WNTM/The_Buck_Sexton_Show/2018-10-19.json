[noise]\nDoes the country want to put a check on Donald Trump\nDo we want to put a check on Trump ism\nSo we want to repudiate it or do we want to validate it because should the Republicans\nMaintain majority control in the house should they maintain majority control in the Senate there's president will not only be unchecked\nHe will be emboldened and at the core what he's doing is stoking a whole civil war in this country ... the American people use that ... in the history of the country who makes new preach about being the leader of the American people here's the leader\nIn right now\nAnd I suddenly see political analysis of such crash see Schmidt is among the very worst we'll talk more about he's going to get another parents later the show he does the dumbest stuff on TV so that means that you know fun to use them for commentary purposes they put them on TV a lot on MSNBC though what are you saying isn't true by the way\nWhat are you saying is is not accurate I maybe thinks he's being kind of ... or something but it's not just trumpets on the ballot and in fact what we're seeing is that it is not a the Republicans are not treating it as though there's only Trump on the ballot first of all\nEvery single congressional election has its own idiosyncrasies and realities and a media markets that you'd you'd think a guy that ran a very unsuccessful McCain presidential campaign should should know that uh but beyond that there's a there's a clear dynamic that has unfolded in the last\nCouple of weeks last few weeks\nThat could change this election much how you got it right now and in fact I spoke to\nI'll tell you I had a I had a chat with Lindsey Graham flashlight spoken for about twenty minutes we sort of sat down we're over Fox and I was I was up Lindsey we weren't off the record but I was giving him\nA little bit of what I think's going to he was give me a little bit of what do you think's going on and here's the bottom line\nThe Kavanaugh effect is very real\nLindsey certainly knows that because he had his proudest moment I think ever in the Senate defending Kavanaugh but here's what's happening and the reason that this is trending toward the Republicans at this stage of the game because you know the Democrats are are they're running a a campaign at\nAll the local level of a or a local elections\nRather a you know at the state and and congressional level of healthcare you don't hear about it much but that's what they're messaging has healthcare helped your health care at the national level they're making this whole Trump issue but really they're pushing the health care issue very hard because they know the polling showed that that actually for the people were going to vote that matters to the Republicans\nDo have had a gift recently and what you see is that the cabin all effect in any state that's read where there's a Democrat who's trying to pull the usual you know Democrat oh I'm kind of centrist on these things I'm sort of a conservative Democrat had fake is\nThat's not going to fly that's not going to work [noise] um the dynamic of this playing out right now is the uh the\nDynamics playing out is that in states where\nIt's clearly a red state and the conservatives Republicans have the advantage Trump showing up for base turnout trumpet showing up to make sure the base remembers that they need to be a part of what's going on here in this midterm election\nBut the dynamic and I think is really interesting and you're not hearing you talk about the media because they're all they're they're actively wishing in a way they hope it goes away\nAnd it is that in a elections\nThat are in states where it's kind of a you know a a Democrat in a in a red state you know it's a little bit of a of a close circle all across the board\nThey want people to come and speak about the cabinet issue they want Lindsey Graham to go and speak because that's a reminder to anyone who's toward the center of just how you cannot trust the Democrats with power\nShowing very red in very red states to get the base out you're going to have a lot of talk about you're going to have Trump visiting Trump's getting the base fired up he's going to get them to show up at the polls are great but in states where it's a closer call it a little more purple where there you're going to have\nThe Lindsey Graham's of the G O P showing up and saying remember what they did the Kavanaugh you can't put these people you can't trust these people with power you are not\nBeing a responsible citizen if you think that these Democrats should be given any any more authority and they're already have all the wives the American people\nAnd cabinet could be the game changer think about what a political miscalculation the Democrats made their think about what that what really happened they thought that they would stop\nThe Supreme Court sheet from going to a conservative constitution list and even if they couldn't stop it they would be rewarded by their base\nFor just going thermonuclear to try to stop it just ... scorched earth do everything they could but what we're seeing is dating anticipate that in a lot of close fought elections in suburban parts of America are a lot of Republican women\nAre furious about what happened to Capitol furious\nAnd they want to make a statement and they're coming out to vote you know if your a pink hat wearing you know meet your T shirt emblazoned left wing feminist\nYou already we're gonna voted you hate Trump doesn't matter but if you're somebody was like well you know sometimes I I'm a little bit you know ... with some of what Trump has done it but you're you're a Republican woman\nAnd you see what they did the Kavanaugh what the Democrats did and what that would mean for the future of this country going forward a lot of them are absolutely\nFired up about this and that could be the game changer it could be the enthusiasm among center right wing in suburban districts that makes this house contract it's going to be down to the wire\nThis is going to be really close I think\nCould she'll go to the Republicans oh that would feel like a miracle but it could still\nAnd\nIt's going to be because of Kavanaugh so folks that fight that we had to defend Kavanaugh\nI've got a cup of it in my hands right now my friends black rifle coffee and I'm drinking it black because it is delicious coffee in fact I've turned a bunch of people in my office and just in my day to day life in the black rifle coffee drinkers\nOnce they tried to realize that this is as

Fox News Saudi Arabia now says they're looking into the disappearance of journalists them all to show me last seen three weeks ago and during this valley consulate in Istanbul\nClaimed by Saudi Arabia that all the stuff they in the case now being interrogated in Saudi Arabia and so to say that one they would actually visiting New York today could show ... while the other claims that he the one of them died a couple of years ago still holds apparently in the story\nAnd that's going to be the ... that's the kind of decision that is going to be the very\nTop level of any government US government any government whether they're going to let that information get out if they have a short memory could be a human source right we don't know\nBut if you're going to have proof if you're going to show evidence of this you would have to also most likely be willing to say where can I say what it is which means you're going to expose very likely how how you got it [noise]\nAh so I I don't know I don't know what they've got quite yet um but I Do think that there is a\nVery real possibility here that the Saudis are I'm sure they're going to suffer some consequences but they're gonna\nProbably live to fight another day diplomatically on this one because they're going to say that it's just\nSomething that happened they were in control of it and you know things things go bad and or there'll be better in the future or something like that and then I remember the Saudis are in the region are pretty important player for us ... sectors they pump pay Oregon\nTitle for the Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days\nTo complete that we do have some understanding of the ... which one we can make decisions about how the United states should respond\nSurrounding the city of I think it's important for love or do we I Belong to a sightseeing thirty two long relationship\nWith the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nTo continue to be important kind of terrorism\nCustody of the two holy sites\nForeign changing\nAlliance the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\nIt's an important ally\nSomething that we want to just discount just fly off the handle and decide that we're going to try and make some big statement here\nThere are plenty of places all over the world were very very bad things happen to people on a daily basis we can't make all of at our problem I Know that there's symbolism ear journalist he was he was a green card holder he was a permanent was in this country not the same as being a citizen but\nHe definitely had very real ties to America this was this happened on foreign soil however and so the people that are calling for an investigation I\nThink just don't realize what all the hurdles are in place of that investigation\nWe have no basis certainly don't have any jurisdiction but no basis for sending any kind of investigative team and last one the Turks allow it 'cause it's Turkish\nDitch Turkish sovereignty here I mean is on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the council it so you are multiple levels of complexity added in what would already be an investigation that is highly sensitive\nAnd I don't know who we think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean we don't send Americans to do this I Would be very suspicious of what information we get and how we get it\nBut if we do send Americans um well I just I doubt that's going to happen unless they were brought along kind of riding shotgun so to speak\nVice president Pence however is saying that there will be consequences play clip ten oh I can hear you though\nThere will be consequences the vice president says notice that people are pretty pretty thin on details\nOf what those consequences would be and it's because not only do we have to be concerned with the immediate Saudi response which would be both over and covert I'm sure against our interest in a whole bunch of different ways we also think about the unintended consequences here\nAnd what would happen from a major fracture in the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia truth is we don't want a major break with the Saudis um the Saudis are in some ways useful right now and here's what nobody really wants to say\nThe scariest scenario for America when it comes to Saudi Arabia in a lot of ways is actually a revolution and then democracy um the Saudi people in charge of what goes on in\nThat countrymen representation and Saudi Arabia for look just remember what happened with the Arab Spring with at all it's going to be great in Egypt they're going to elect people western style democracy is going to be great there's going to be human rights and women are going to school and all these things which I mean that was happening in Egypt beforehand but you know what I mean is going to be a really\nBig step forward\nAnd then the Muslim Brotherhood came into power\n[noise] let me tell you something if they had elections in Saudi Arabia the Islamists would be in power there too and I would offer to you probably much more hard line Islamists than anybody wants to admit or or would would realize right now because of the\nClerics that are allowed to preach and Saudi Arabia right now only do so with the acceptance and the and he said show of the government if you actually had the top pulled off his thing and the people of Saudi Arabia were calling the shots in the preachers were whoever they were listening to\nUh it would be bad very quickly and that's that's kind of a nightmare scenario it's one of the reasons why the Saudis and the Pakistanis for example get away with as much as they do in terms of our relationship with them is because the worst case scenario is not that they're mad at us the worst case scenario for the government is overthrown in either of those places and Pakistan\nBecause you have nuclear missiles in the equation it's particularly scary ah in Saudi Arabia\nWe have very few powerful military allies left in the middle east is dwindling we've Israel and then it starts to get pretty thin Jordan has a good ally but it's a small country not but not for the wealthier powerful one\nOf the Turks are increasingly Islam ... they can't be counted on to be our friends in the Mid East Saudis obviously we've got this problem playing out right now got our concerns there\nEgypt is just not what it once was not as reliable a partner and it's got its own problems and you look around the region like who can we turn to who will be helpful I mean Iraq we're just hoping the place doesn't\nCollapse into some kind of ethnic civil war and you got it wrong clearly is not particularly fond of the United states so when we talk about consequences for the Saudi Government\nBecause it would be against the whole state of Saudi Arabia I mean I don't think that there's going to say we want a Magnitsky sanctions against just a few individuals I don't think that would be\nA sufficient response people are talking about a hundred billion dollar arms deal uh getting shifted around one way or another getting stopped ... whatever they they end up doing\nA this these are major consequences these are major consequences and then you have to look at the other side of this which is the people who are the loudest voices on this issue many of them plenty of people with the loudest voices on this do not have\nAmerica's interest necessarily at heart\nThey view this as an opportunity to both criticized and antagonize the Trump Administration that's right as I've been telling you this is supposed to really just turned ... turn into a means of getting at Trump and saying that no matter what happens it's his fault will get into that in a moment\nDoor the social media is full of lots and lots of different ways that they can make you disappear

B. a seal you ask for a miracle I bring you the F. B. or to get that one but not really it's it's true that Rosenstein has somehow managed to stay in this role and well I think it's because he knows that\nThe hash tag resistance and Trump does is to just not worth getting rid of them ... resistance would\nCall them sleep late and utterly freak out if in fact there was a a a a removal of Rosenstein from his duties\nBut some people don't care you got the chairman of the Freedom Caucus Mark Meadows he is calling on Rosenstein to step down at a ... a deputy attorney general\nBecause lawmakers are looking into reports about how roads and saw once talked about wearing a wire record President Trump you know I really do believe that what if when I was a little a little uh nobody CIA analyst if I had said that I was going to\nWear a wire to try and trap just even the CIA director I think I Would have been scored it out of the building by secured by armed security I think they would have been like okay you're ... if I say that in a meeting in front of people but for the deputy attorney general to say it and I've gone back and forth on this I don't I don't think he was kidding\nI think that became the excuse but the more I thought about it I'm not sure what the latest if you're only booked two weeks ago said he was kidding yeah but I thought about it more I don't know like I wasn't there that's all I can do is base it on the things that I've heard\nBut you know Rosenstein or has he look he's an Obama administration hold over\nAnd he's clearly very tight with the DEA OJ bureaucracy and the bureaucracy protects itself\nBut that's why Mark Meadows is finally had enough\nHere's what Fox News reports about meadows of the Freedom Caucus he says that he made the comments about Rosenstein stepping down as James Baker the FBI's former top lawyer was questioned behind closed doors on Capitol Hill earlier today about Rosenstein is reported comments as well as other decisions made by the bureau\nMeadows criticize Rosenstein for not accepting ... testified for the house Judiciary Committee about the record a reporter comments\n[noise] you know roses ... there should be accountability there should be accountability for those people should not uh people should not be able to do and say whatever they want in a senior government role like that just because getting rid of them might feel kind of messy\nAnd that's not the only deep states kind of a deep state updates the deep state store I wanted to tell you about uh you have\nA\nTreasury employee who is charged with leaking financial fence and reports on Trump team people\nShe was apparently arrested where they flash drive in hand here's a quote from Fox the top Treasury Department employee was charged with leaking confidential financial documents pertaining to former Trump officials was apprehended the previous even with a flash drive continue the allegedly ... information in her hand\nOh my gosh caught\nRed handed or flash handed went nuts week that's week but\nThe dramatic arrest late late Tuesday came on the heels of other high profile criminal prosecutions of the administration which has pledged to go on the offensive against leakers the presidents have called traders and cowards are so this is now the Mayflower Edwards who's a senior official at the financial crimes enforcement network\nShe gave a reporter bank reports allegedly documenting several suspicious financial transactions\nVicious show dirty as as I've been telling you I really want you understand this isn't leaking information that is necessarily accurate or even meaningful this is leaking rumors in a sense that the federal government has on a hand that they can look into\nPossible health introducing new Medicaid claims in Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more likely to go family care dot com that's still family care dot com ... three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from up to my health right your smart speaker\nMakes it easy to listen to rush just tell me what you want and I do in Alaska set an alarm for news radio seven WNBA em on I ours radio [noise]\nWe are service [noise] our economy is driven by ... eighty plus percent of our GDP eighty plus percent of our job creation is services\nSo when you're a service economy the way to stimulate the economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy goods as cheaply as they possibly can and use the rest of their money to buy service\nIt was or if they're lucky enough to have anything that raises the price is a good doesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying it to the government and the terror it's just another cat\nBefore we are close out ... real quick here to get from a grade on the economy eighth or ... what\nWould it be so far well you know I'd have to qualify that I Would say on a general parents are pretty good regulations are down and taxes are down but I I gave him more credit which is pseudo credit and that is he's a great cheerleader\nAnd there is such a thing as subjectivity in in cheerleading and you know an economy that people do respond in a positive way uh this way\nBut the economy has done better but it's all it's sort of like you're doing well if you could borrow a million dollars every every month you know so uh but the economy on the surface is good but it's not sound is not lasting it's based on that and the payment will come too soon\n\nI'm sure many recognize that second voice that was Ron Paul man himself who saying it's all going to come crashing down\nBefore that you had Gary Cohn who is very much the establishment voice in and were economy is right now and he's saying you know services gotta ... it's all about services gotta keep good cheap got to get people buying stuff that you know Wal Mart and I was gonna say Sears alright piece years all righty\nBut these are very different views of what's going on right now here's what I Would say about the Ron Paul uh let me let me deal with the Ron Paul suffers that was from an interview we did on rising by the way where I got to speak to foreign Congressman Paul\n[noise] ah [noise] he's right Ron Paul is right mathematically historically he is correct or there is\nA very clear history of the currency in a in the history of the world and it is that fewer currency always ends in disaster and\nFinancial calamity is very clear that there's there's no exception it always ends very very badly now that said Ron Paul saying that the economy right now is not sound too much debt and all that he can be right put on what timeline\nAnd if Ron Paul is right that the economy is going to crash fifty years from now you have to ask yourself today how much do you care I Know we don't have to say over my kids and my grandkids and but how much do you really care and beyond that\nIf it fifty years from now how do you leave the Next Fifty years right how do you\nTry to make money in the markets or how do you try to move on to your career and pay off your house deal with the the basic financial challenges that we all have ride telling telling you that the stock market might go to zero and our our dollar maybe worth nothing which I don't I don't think that's ever going to happen but even if it were true that happened to fifty years that's not very useful information right now\nTo Ron Paul's been saying that the economy was going to crash out for a very long time and it was kind of writing two thousand eight we came up on the precipice I get that are two thousand nine\nBut I don't think that he's right right now I just\nPut his I put his words in there because I Do think that it's a long term warning and especially as we are considering now the possibility of dealing with some of the entitlement programs that are the big drivers of our debt\nWe got to remember that\nWe're we're heading into we're heading to a bad place might not be two years from now might be twenty we're heading to a bad place as an economy unless we do something about it and it's very hard to get the political will you know look this is\nI go home and I'm like you know what I I really\nWish I'd get lean again enough that that I Would just see all my muscles right that'd be fun but you know it's more fun than than putting myself on that pretty strict routine of calories add calories in calories out and all that you know it's more fun eating a big gluten free donut\nWhen I get home that's the thing they exist\nOr you know deciding to just eat half a wheel of brie that's fun right now and when you're dealing with long term projections sneak and it was in pre amazing breeze always so good when did you live in long term projections in the economy\nDoes that sound will to fancy rags debris debris delicious ... ah I also like American cheese on American cheese burger yesterday was delicious [noise]\nAh [noise] nobody wants to be the one that has to think long term no one wants to be the one that I have to think strategically about this you want to deal with your immediate needs\nAnswer Ron Paul as I said he's right but when we just don't know that doesn't mean we shouldn't take action that just means we need to be aware that the action is not going to come quickly and we should\nBalance out what are what what what risks are accepted what systemic risks are acceptable to our our economy to our children and grandchildren's economies are\nAnd then you Gary Cohn with tariffs on China I\nI really hope that Trump is right on this one I've given them a lot of credit on the tariff issue and um I've been willing to say that I ... I Know what the I Know what the argument is against terrorists but I Know the the smart set is almost always an entirely opposed the tariffs\nTrump has taken a different approach and I think he has earned the right to try and\nPlay it out however he can that said ah I Do\nHave some concerns about where this is where this is going in the economy it's been a ... a few weeks and people have ... ... people have seen some stuff that's going on right now and the economy and that's\nThat's when you got to start really thinking about what's what's happening next because I'm telling you the Democrats easiest path to power is a recession where they turn all just raised it created on the left and they mobilize it and they're going to mobilize it in the direction of socialist\nThat's what they're going to do that is what is coming a so\nBy the way I really do recommend you all checkout buck event dot com it's a a project I'm working all the stansberry research because I'll go where the market is going that's different from the overall economy but if you want to know where the stock market is going book invent dot com smartest guys I've ever met when it comes to the market and we're doing a big event on October twenty fourth [noise]\nTotally free Bucky event dot com sign up check it out you'll see I'll be hosting some other experts I'm just a host\nWas a game show host but they're the guys are actually spending all we know what I mean\nIt'll be a lot of fun to check that out but I I'm going to keep watching the economy and see what's happening I just hope things stay steady intellectually [noise]\nYou know I just saw the c._e._o. of global verification network earlier this week we caught up in the swamp here in DC and I said you know how's business going how's your growing so rapidly and\nGetting so many new clients on board he said well simply put but we're all about making sure that people's data is cured that they get fast answers and that they know the all the work is being done here the United states by train professionals\nThat what you get when it comes to background investigations and vetting was global verification network also whenever you call them you'll get a person who answers your call and answers your questions\nRight away [noise] called eight seven seven six nine five one one seven nine eight seven seven six five one one seven I jumped ... cents you this is a veteran owned and operated company my friends you can also go to my\nGV N. dot com that my GV N. dot com for all background investigations whatever size you were company whatever size we're business my GV and\nThursday I never ate the what's the other day on the free I heard a radio at\nDays Phil Halloween to focus on the scary fine and get into Syria with the heart radio original vision Halloween radio commercial free Halloween hit better both of mine in the area [laughter] pick that perfect Halloween costume lawyer candy\nHis victims to help you with all those activities in radio and I are radio\nYou deserve a better way to watch the sports buff ESPN fluffy by force and onto the show for\nWith the original and the entire thirty for thirty\nAnd you really have to wonder why that is why is it the Farrah Khan continues to or it is able to continue saying the kind of things that he says doing the things that he does\nHe doesn't get banned from Twitter by the way he that to my knowledge has not been kicked off a social media platforms and he says stuff\nLike this play clips three\nMembers of the Jewish community that don't like me [noise]\nThank you very much for putting my name all over the planet [noise]\nBecause of your fair [noise] of what we represent [noise] I can go anywhere in the world and they hurt or far [noise]\nI'm not mad at you\nBecause you're so stupid [noise]\nSo when they talk about ... Khan call me I have\nTo come\nIn and he's been my [noise]\n[noise] oh man did turn my [noise]\nDone an anti Semite he says but an anti termite or if you are referring to Jewish people in this country\n... a disgrace and he should be recognized as such by any moral and decent human being it describes a what he says is truly hateful what he says it's destructive and polls at the very fabric of this country\nBut I'm Wondering why is it that there aren't calls to boycott Farrah Khan at least not ones that you hear from the mainstream media why is it that she doesn't get banned from social media platforms and also\nWhy do we hear so much about the hate under the Trump Administration and generally points all points back to Charlottesville right away when Charlottesville you had\nA group of losers walking around with tiki torches that Ninety nine percent of the country would block and ridicule and ignore\nA Ninety nine point nine percent and yet\nWith Farrah Khan who is saying horrific and hateful anti Semitic things here is giving speeches in front of thousands of people thousands of followers he's a very prominent figure among among a certain set of Muslim nation of Islam and Muslim Americans\nHe's treated with reverence spy thousands and thousands of people\nHow is what he says any less hateful how is what he says any less disgusting than what you'll hear from some of these\nUh white nationalists he's calling Jewish people termites I mean it it actually makes me mad to hear it it makes you mad you even quoted in say he's a complete disgrace yet he's been in public life in this country for decades for decades\nWhy isn't there media segment that for media segment calling for him to be announced that we can all start\nTo fill in the blanks here with why we think that there's this double standard but the point is that there is a double standard\nAnd it's one that we can't ignore when we're hearing from the left about how they just want the fate or they just want to fight hates in society if they just wanted to fight hate then they would make sure that there was less hate in society on all sides\nBut really they use the term hate\nAs a weapon against the right now as if the only hate that can exist is from a very very small insignificant angry band\nOf losers who call themselves either in a white nationalist or neo Nazis or\nAny of the above the truth is that people of any background can hate\nThe truth is that people have any ethnicity or religious denomination can be hateful\nSo if one goal is to eliminate have from society that has to be universally applied it can't just be only sometimes in only against some people and ... and it's just a glaring example of how the left is on serious when it comes to eliminating have from our society\nThey only want to use that moral currency right because we all want to be a part of that of that crusade we all want to get rid of a hateful destructive vial rhetoric right nobody supports that stuff\nBut they don't want our help really they just want to keep it as the right is where hate lives and there's no such thing as hate on the left ... there's no hate their black lives matter there is no hate toward cops Farrah Khan well\nThey'll admit that Farrah Khan is hateful and many in the media now are starting to turn on this issue and realize that they can't allow us to continue\nBut why is it taking so long and why as the criticism been so muted\nThe left is going to have any standards at all maybe they should start enforcing them now\nSo I end up taking a lot of trains and how to use public why that puts me on edge right when I'm going up to New York or went back down to the swamp or somewhere in between I really don't want to have to worry\nAbout my data getting hacked by somebody because I'm On on six your network well I decided to take this into my own hands where they virtual private network courtesy of express VPN expressed\nVPN make sure that my online data is safe and it's easy to use apps that runs seamlessly and all it takes is seven dollars a month and you can make sure that you don't have to worry about people getting your most important private and yes valuable information\nProtect yourself on line today find out how you can get three months free and express VPN dot com slash book that's express V.

it feels like the answer's no\nThere's nothing that they won't pollute with their hyper politicization sports not sacred anymore oh yeah a SBN is now MSNBC with sports\nSo we have to hear from all these athletes about what they're different\nPolitical opinions are and then if we say you know that guy is not particularly well informed we're told that were being you know dismissive and rude and

rest of the country about an issue right so\nThere's nothing that seems that really escapes but fairy tales\nYou would hope might be in something of a special category and I I think it's acceptable

activist\nI look back to ... county how\nWith you on the boat on radio network and you must write head football coach Terry Curtis joined just here on the pregame show and the coach big win last week in Monroe County sixty five the nuts and played a lot of kids in fact the young guys played most of the second half but my big take away from the game was the uh the open field running of our full but no but our main where'd that come from\n[laughter] a that was kind of interesting yeah jumping over a guy like he did but but no is it good runner he was up until he got a little bit bigger and all he was a backup running back and\nA cup probably play running back home but uh we need to pull back and being a team player that he that he is a a\nA he made the move and and uh he's having a great year he been one of our our guys who we needed to show up and and he's done at each and every weekend and is he loves the as he kind of figure out what's going on\nMore and more every week he get better every week so uh you know a A N salmon would be the first one to tell you that that is hard to run up and never got a good pullback\nSpeaking of that how is Simon\nDom and find common practice all week he'll play tonight to uh he's missed one day a practice and uh uh he just kind of tweak to the inside of a knee or whatever and and uh Stacey a heroin are are trying to work with him\nA Saturday and Sunday and a and a Monday you you know we were low prices week and I asked him yesterday who's going to wear that bright friday and he said he hoped not so but he said to be fine a full speed but you never know toe low you know you get out there and get in contact\nJay Jay ... freshman gotta lotta touches scored three touchdowns a little different I won't say pace because they're the size not a whole lot of different data looks quick\nWell he makes I'm a little bit you know I mean as far as I was but but not a good game and it was fun you know really from the end of the first I applaud there and the whole second half we played the or the young guys in\nA ... you know what I did well or two or three touchdowns and block the pay Poland and hit some folks and that was good to say it's always good\nFor morale and and uh and energy and everything when I was young guys get into to a bar C. game and they deserve to get those games you know they they take a beating weekend wink out so uh so it was a good thing it was a good thing to see them have some fun\nAnd what are we say about the defense so actually what I read yesterday leading the state and all classifications in scoring depots only given up three points a game\nWhere they are and uh you know they're still flying around the ball but uh you know the weight will be tested a a a little bit different op fence they've got a quarterback\nOr maybe the ... fight against he looks down the field he he can also Ron so he's a threat doing that so we'll see that part they've got a couple of white outs that are good and then all of a sudden they're jumping an hour or double wing runway pagan so you've got a lot you got to look for so are are they will be tested or\nA ... ... tonight against a team that does a lot of things and uh so that'll be interesting to say\nBecause if you think about it and you ask a lot of people we're looking at it a few weeks ago we had never thought this game would be as big as it is
