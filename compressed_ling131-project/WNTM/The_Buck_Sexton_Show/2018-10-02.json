T. three immobile\nBy his nominee President Trump at a rally in Tennessee continue to support for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Fox is the Rapaport has more line\nToday we had a the Monday after all the Sunday shows\nAnd I look forward to ah what happens on the Sunday shows because we can get a couple of things\nIn our minds if you watch the Sunday talk shows meaning meet the press and ABC's This week and Fox News Sunday and even the thing over and CBS that nobody watches and Jake Tapper you can kind of get an idea\nThe talking points are from both sides\nIt's the iron and yesterday Lindsey Graham was doing ... duty getting out there making what I Would consider a primary ... case against the Democrats and exposing what they have done the despicable\nApproach they took on trying to block judge Kavanaugh at all costs so I'm a I'm Amazed amazed at what I saw I Lindsey Graham just lifted my heart last week when he made that statement saying what a weasel\nThe Democratic side of the aisle he turned into and how they treated judge Kavanaugh and if you watched\nThe Sunday talk shows\nI was going to say that it was the greatest episode of meet the press ever but I don't know if anybody will get the joke\nYesterday was the single best episode of meet the press that I have ever seen no nobody well it wasn't on last week because ah the Ryder Cup match the golf match preempted it\nSo that's why was the single greatest episode ever\nBut the the terminology that has shown up\nIn the language of the left when it comes to blocking judge Kavanaugh now let's go over some of the arguments that they have a brought up to block Kavanaugh one of those arguments was well he's going to ah he's going to overturn roe overturn roe v way\nThat was the first one they said we can't have this is going to overturn\nRoe v way and then after the meetings with judge Kavanaugh and some of the testimony it seems like you know maybe he's not\nGoing to come in with a judicial prejudice and and look to overturn roe v white so they they shifted gears and then suddenly at the end of the hearing process they came up with this accuser and the anonymous accuser that Dianne Feinstein at Santa for six weeks\nAnd so we said wait a minute we're going to question his character from thirty six years ago on we then discovered\nHow many holes there were in the story\nOf professor Ford and then over the weekend after the testimony and I was in DC last week I saw buck on Thursday we ran into each other the book party for a friend of ours I was in D.C to cover the or the hearing and the protests\nAnd then last week when it look like despite all the obstruction and deflection and and all the moves that were being made by the left\nThat judge Kavanaugh was going to push through and we would still have this week long investigation which everybody knew everybody and the dog knew that the Democrats who were going to complain that week was not enough\nThey started shifting the narrative and listen to your friends listen to your friends on the left who are saying they're using the phrase the wrong temperament\nTo be a Supreme Court justice he has the wrong temperament this is\nBeing said by virtually every single one of the pundits it's being said by the senators the or the Congress\nPeople on the left and I'll bring it up and you will hear the parrots from the left on Facebook and Twitter bringing it up he's the wrong temperament and SNL which will get into\nSNL one after Kavanaugh and everyone's saying he was yelling I'm Sorry he wasn't yelling if that's what you called yelling\nYou're ignorant and let's not forget a week and a half ago when a judge Kavanaugh was interviewed on Fox News they said oh he's too robotic he's he doesn't have a motion and then when it comes out in defends himself and his family he's called too emotional he doesn't have the right temperament\nThey're even now playing the card if a woman had done what judge Kavanaugh dead she'd be called hysterical\nAnd not the good hysterical you know the the crazy hysterical will get into that a little bit but it got to check in with one of the ... family\nOn the phone from Alabama Solomon checking into the evening Solomon welcome to the buck section and show how are you\nDoing fabulous I'm Glad you're there but now a move the country forward\nOh God Bless you thank you what what part

shining was the leading vote getter despite my constant lobbying to have neither the living dead get the crops that it deserves from fifty years of scaring the heck out of people but the shining is as\nIt is well the shining it's such a ... very well directed movie and uh my only complaint with the shiny we thought that Nicholson's character was weird from the very beginning and I think in order to have a real tragic character shift\nYou have to like the guy first he was weird from\nDid actually he came off a little bit scary or maybe a little bit psychologically orange stable and it's sad to my correct\nYeah yeah so ... here we are ... on a great political talk show we're analyzing scary movies but uh I'd asked John John what'd you want to say about Chuck Schumer 'cause I'm no fan of shame or he was my senator for twenty plus years\nI just wanted to say that I have an absolute hatred for the guy and he's got a huge big mouth and he always said the Robin Hood saw into wearing what it\nSaid today about um the judge Barry said that he was a you know deeply deeply part is saying is there any ... this cat or didn't notice judge from the carrots eight Chuck Schumer is got a big

shot over doubt I Will check this out Jody I Will absolutely\nTake a look at that and a night of the living dead is the one you want to see if you want to be scared dawn of the dead was the sequel and I think it was a lot cheesier it's still is wonderful in terms of ... horror film classics\nBut to me there's nothing nothing scarier than nine to the living dead in a close second is Texas Chainsaw massacre too because I I knew the young lady who played the lead in that\nAnd that movie with just terrifying so I'm so glad you're still out there Jody so glad you're still loyal to buck and uh all of all of his exploits and appreciate you being there every time I'm here filling in for thank you very much my friend\nOr a ... a lot going on\nI Want to bring something up I was talking about\nUh just before the break I was talking about one of the sponsors of this program ...\nAnd it's a company that has a new social media platform and I think it's really important especially when we see what's going on on social media it's been weeks now\nThat one of the brighter people on social media who happens to be a conservative has been silent some talking about James Woods\nJames Woods has over a million followers and Twitter has told him he cannot come back on line unless she removes something he posted he posted a comedic mean\nAnd he even said this basically is a joke but they told them unless he deletes it he's not allowed back on the format\nAnd I thought wow this is a publicly traded company and and then I thought well maybe just maybe they're out there making sure that they apply the same kinds of standards of principles to everybody who's on Twitter\nAnd I looked at and I saw\nThe horrific thing the Rosie o'donald posted after Lindsey Graham went after the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and called them out for what they were doing how they were destroying judge Kavanaugh\nAnd how they were actually make it impossible for anyone to want to be\nWell a Supreme Court justice God Knows what else will be affected by this attack on a good man but Rosie O'Donnell tweezers out\nAnd I have to um have to delete some of the things she said because they can't say I'm On the radio she said F. you you closeted idiot\nThis is the patriarchy exposed\nThis is reality deal with it no Kavanaugh's confirmation not my president well Rosie O'Donnell put that out there and went after Lindsey Graham and she's basically here's a gay woman who's making an\nAllegation that Lindsey Graham is a closeted homosexual\nHow is that allowed how is that not considered hate speech how is that not considered to be over the line by the gods of Twitter\nHow Twitter how explain\nI guess if you're a liberal you can say just about anything\nI guess if you're a person on the other side of the aisle it's okay to smear somebody for example a Bill Maher or did the same thing Bill Maher on his show this past weekend after Lindsey Graham gave his fiery speech supporting judge Kavanaugh\nThis was on television this weekend and appeared all over Twitter\nYou know what is bad is this trust the fine [noise]\nThat from can either find people like him or make him anyway and I am right strain was stabilizing influence ... boyfriend because he is [laughter] [noise]\nSo now bill Marr has smeared Lindsey Graham and he is also smeared John McCain all in in Seventeen Seconds on his show\nHow is this a loud and don't even get me started on what senator now why did attacking Kavanaugh\nSaturday Night live attacking Kavanaugh in Graham and the entire process is all about any means necessary to tear down this nominee\nBut I don't understand how one social media platform is allowed to\nSingle handedly silence conservative it's I've been shadow band if I put a post on my Twitter account at stumped for and if you will and I include a reference to a gun or a firearm\nIs uniformly relegated to the ash sheet of Twitter shadow banning I'm shoved off into the abyss and not given the opportunity to let my audience read it\nBut if I take out the word gun or a firearm and put in something like banana instantly it's available to everybody\nI Know it sounds paranoid but it it's true\nSo how's this allowed how's this even allowed to happen well I think we've lost their minds we have given every opportunity to be offensive to the left and zero to be offensive from the right\nAnd maybe it's time we all stood up and looked at some of our folks and there are alternatives to these other social media platforms\nI'm just saying oh I don't get me started on Cathy Griffin Kathy Griffin also went after Lindsey Graham and called Lindsey Graham ms Lindsey Graham and John Lennon overt CNN additionally said that Lindsey Graham had the vapors\nSomething usually attributed to a woman in the south\nSo Don Lemon Kathy Griffin Rosie O'Donnell and Bill Maher you can all make jokes that impugn a man's heterosexuality or a mock a man and yet you are the people living in the universe\nIt seems like the people in the universe might get a little upset too but I guess not I guess this is about any means necessary and I I just don't understand it or maybe I'll get a quick uh movie here a time in New Haven Connecticut Welcome to the buck sex than show yet a scary movie for me\nYes I did a [noise] a Halloween you know as much an outline in\nYour you know that's a really
