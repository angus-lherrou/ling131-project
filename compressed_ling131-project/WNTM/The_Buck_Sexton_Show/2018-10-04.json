Fox News five officers in Florence County South Carolina gunned down boxes Rapaport has more lie\nClear proof one way or the other so let's factor it in\nWe heard so much about how she'd be the polygraph I shouldn't say well that was maybe friday and right there she was cleared by the polygraph maybe you could say polygraph said that she was not being deceptive she was being truthful what if she knows how to be to step up on a polygraph\nIf she knows how to do that by the way that would indicate that she lied under oath and if you lied under oath about the polygraph by the way I still don't believe that she took the polygraph not knowing she was going to come forward so I've always thought that was a lie but if you lie under oath about taking the polygraph than\nWe know that she's not delusional then she's actually a malicious actor here and given that we've been told including by sitting US Senators that millions of lives are at stake\nMillions of women's lives are at stake if Kavanaugh gets on the Supreme Court which is insane thing to say that it is pretty widespread among Democrats\nWhy is it so hard to believe that somebody would try and do something that they would view as a great\nAct of heroism and that they will be heralded for on the left for generations to come for that you think that that's that's ... that's so knocked credible really I find that hard to believe\nThose who today we're criticizing Trump for weighing in here seem to forget that just because there are allegations are now falling apart it doesn't mean that the rest of us have forgotten how disgusting how disgraceful how underhanded they have been all along and their efforts to try and around his cabinet nomination\nThat has been their purpose and they have been willing to do anything and everything in order to get there\nThat they're now in a more defensive position and they have been you know ... I saw had a another sworn declaration today that a person was at parties in the eighties where there was drinking insects and and knew the cabinet was that these parties\nI mean at what point are we just put it in high school drinking and socializing\nOr in some kind of weird public trial here ...\nThere there is no names there's no allegations of specific criminality oh yeah I Know I I I'll swear elsewhere testimony out that I went to a party a long time ago and there are people who are drinking and having premarital sex and that was happening\nOkay that's not ... you can't just prove that you're not going to get in trouble for perjury it also doesn't prove anything\nThey ... it was election I keep I keep running into they should be ashamed but are they have no shame and they view this as an ends justifies the means such a situation and that's why I Want to remind everybody\nRight now we've got to keep our eye and the ball here this has never been this\nHas never been about getting to the truth this delay is not about getting to the truth it's not about being fair to Kavanaugh or even respecting the process in any meaningful sense this has been do anything to get the Democrats' way that's what this is\n\nAnd I'm concerned we've got a lot of time is going to pass\nBetween now and friday there was a lot of room for them to come up with something and you've seen the narrative\nShift oh the FBI investigation isn't Folsom enough they haven't done enough um you've seen that happen but there's another component to this to Mrs where I'm most concerned as\nTo how I could see a vote failing or the Senate not having the boats one or the other\nAnd that is this notion now that the only way that we can come back from this brink of partisan a base is if Kavanaugh becomes the sacrificial lamb if Kavanaugh is the one who\nHas to get swept aside here so that we can bring the country back together you see so that we can heal the nation\nI Want to slap myself as I say that but\nTrust me that resonates with people like flake Collins and Murkowski and you could see today some of them at least jockeying around this issue a little bit\nTrying to position themselves for maximum political benefit around Trump oh how how could he so terrible making fun of the victim\nWasn't making fun of or he was really making fun of her testimony which is a different thing a there are people who could make fun to a great extent of Dr Ford you know people will say oh she's so credible she came across as came across to me it's very strange it a little disturbed\nAnd you know the day off I'm hearing all these people that are going on the media and saying well well I was you know I had a sexual assault in my past or I Know somebody who's actually saw the show I Believe Dr Ford dishes\nEthically am a ... completely on cannabis unacceptable position that will lead to monstrous outcomes something bad happened to me so I think that any time there's an allegation of that bad thing involving someone else I Believe that person or I Believe the allegation\nThat's not the way the system's supposed to work that's not the way moral judgment can be passed\nBut this was a hysteria there was a frenzy here and it was fed so much by politics but also by the personalization of so much of this\nKavanaugh versus Ford situation will notice the second the second allegation firmer mirrors and the third from sweating ... they they're barely even discussing that any more\nJust ... you really can't make a case that somebody should be believe when that person isn't even sure that she knows what she's saying\nAs we found out with her near as and in the third case was sweating ... it's an intelligence test watch that interview with Julie sweating it where she's talking about gang rape and being an in community college and hanging out with high school kids and all this stuff and and if you think that she's being truthful\nDon't buy any books with big words in them anytime soon I it's just the truth if you think she's being truthful your your skills of discernment in analysis are ah are lacking\nTo say the least but don't be fooled by what's happening with the damage here\nDon't be fooled for a second just because the narratives are collapsing just because now we can really come out now it's really safe out there to say hold on a second there is some big gap there is some whole there's women who were lying or we do believe the second and third are lying and that's just a coincidence but the first is\nAlso honest I have a hard time believing that now we can speak honestly and truthfully about what has been said to us in the last\nWeek in week and a half and\nWe need to understand that Democrats aren't just relying on that in order to take down capital now it's going to be all we need bipartisanship oh there's a temperament issue here as we discussed yesterday it's about it's about Kavanaugh's character you see\nThey're stuffing his background this is the latest just breaking before I came on the air the ... the Senate with Feinstein in Coons just you're basing themselves for the amusement of the pain cat wearing lunatic

fight [noise]\nI [noise] Frank that are\nConsumed or substance is the word out we've wiggle\nMy toe six pack or an hour for [noise] for going back to class or things like that\nWhen Obama talked to the media about his\nBrain election for illegal drugs fighting in his own words there I being a thug when he was younger it was evidence of a kind of authenticity and I guess the charm now he oh yeah that's right Obama he was living living life on the wild side back in the day\nAnd he we also know that he\nAdmitted to doing cocaine which I Would say is in a different category for most people than alcohol or even marijuana right to cocaine is\nThat's the whole step above and no one had any issue with it in the media at least nobody and some of you might have been an issue with it but the media to have an issue with it\nAnd now we're supposed to be upset 'cause cabin I was drinking beer that's what this really about\nThe behavior that involved a all kinds of illegal stuff that Obama did was held up as being cool by the way I I Know I'm just going to say this\nIs just my my sense of it I got I got no evidence for back back in his up you know you could say maybe bucks credible when he said just maybe not I don't believe they're bomb and got into fights I don't believe it I think he said it could be things that makes it sound cool I don't believe that Obama got into fights you can tell me I'm Crazy\nBut nope it strikes me as a just I don't I don't see it I don't know\nAnd I never prove it one way or the other but just when he said it is\nNot really I don't think I don't think Obama's been at a fist fight in his whole life that will be my guest um but then again\nI'm just throwing based on what's credible folks I don't I don't have any evidence one way or the other just going based on what I think is credible here but\nThe double standard problem is a very big one whether we're talking about the Clintons and the sexual stuff that went on a ... with Bill Clinton whether we're talking about the way the media treated Bill Clinton's accusers versus the way the media treats lousy forwarded plenty for to sacrosanct why\nWhy can't we look into her past why she she's made herself a center of national attention she did not have to do this I I also have never her civic duty\nThat was the justification for all this it was her civic duty really who believes that she's an ideologue she's ... she's a left wing partisan\nAnd she thought she had a chance to take out a a game changing Supreme Court\nFifth vote that would have gone not even not conservative by the way I think Kavanaugh I mean don't get me started on this I think Kevin I was going to be much closer to Roberts and a lot of people realize Roberts is the one who saved Obamacare\nI don't think the cabinet 'cause I think happened I was going to have a kind of judicial minimalist approach unlike what the left goes\nFor which is what I like this and so now my opportunity to make it the law the land I don't think that that's what you can expect from Kavanaugh at all but you know Obama's past\nShortcomings foibles illegal activity whatever that was all charming and grade and you know evidence that Obama was cool\nA Bill Clinton's sexual improprieties which by the way I Would say are in a whole different category of anything that Obama did I'm not trying to see I I can make these distinctions the left will say yeah capital as like Bill Cosby 'cause they're idiots\nOr you know what Obama did is probably pretty normal teenager and young adult stuff I'm not trying to say that he was I think honestly used over standing and if anything to sound cool\nAh what Bill Clinton did when he was a full grown adult and governor of Arkansas and then later president was disgusting and illegal and horrific and the media covered forum for eight years really you you look back to the way that the media dealt with Bill Clinton and the\nSex abuse and sex scandals surrounding him and it's what gave us the conservative media that we have\nYou could even argue that people like me even the careers that we have now and the outlets that we have in the alternative means of getting information out there exist in the Drudge Report and talk radio and\nThey exist the way they do because the media sold that sold for Bill Clinton and nice [noise] so you know that this stuff is not distant memory and this is not an remember\nWhat people say oh the Clintons that was a long time ago well we're talking about Kavanaugh allegation that stretch back from thirty five years ago so I

I'd solved bunk nonsense\nThen there's the other part of it and and there's I I when I say excruciating detail I really mean and they're like on a Saturday you know bought a whole bunch of white out to use for some paperwork back in Nineteen eighty seven and any I mean they're just\nMan this is an exhaustive they say it's based on a hundred thousand pages plus of documents in interviews and all this stuff and it felt like I was reading a hundred thousand pages of it myself\nReading is a front page New York times story a or their audience you could only be reading this and could only care about this because they have trumped arrangements syndrome and this was in a sense a trumped arrangements syndrome\nManifesto because nobody could care that much about what Fred trumped Donald Trump's father did in terms of his business dealings really Thirty years ago\nTwenty years ago where does Trump's wealth come from and I couldn't help but read through this and and come to this this this kept popping up\nIn my head that I as I was yes that's right I was lying by pool in Las Vegas for a while is nice you know get a little bit of sun although after about five minutes ago it's easy to my son for me to get the shade my Irish skin doesn't do well with it\nBut I couldn't help but think imagine if they had\nDone this kind of a deep dive\nInto the finances of the Clinton crime family imagine if they had really spent effort looking into what the Clinton Foundation did and did not do what ways the Clintons were able to ah leverage\nThe funding that they were getting offensively for charitable purposes in order to support different aspects of their lifestyle\nBut I've never seen a comprehensive media deep dive by any newspaper or any TV organization into what was really going on with the Clintons with the how is it that the Clintons were worth a hundred million dollars within\nA decade of leaving the White House a hundred million dollars plus remember to have that you know you've got to make about a hundred and sixty a hundred and Seventy million to have to be worth of a network of a hundred but I'd have to make all this money\nWhat is it they didn't they didn't own a company they didn't create a product how they make all this money each it's astonishing when you think about it oh by giving speeches\nWow that's some really amazing speech ... I have the ... that was kind of I'm sounding a little more like George our banks instead of Hillary and my my Hillary is getting a little rusty folks got into more Hillary impersonation um\nI didn't carry on impersonation out here at the confidence that link finds doing yoga and stretching and everybody loved it\nSo see already on a can appear anytime you needed\nTo but they're talking about all these different from tax schemes and here's here's what\nIs so dirty about isn't it reminds me to censor what they've done to Kavanaugh to all this has passed a statute of limitations so so they can say oh you know we we think that he's a\nTax cheat and a criminal which we know Harry Reid said about Mitt Romney not long ago as well and it was a total lie buddy centered on the floor of the Senate so he couldn't be sued forties you legally free to say whatever he wants there and it was intended to just be a political black guy for Romney that Harry Reid\nHim and that was all that was what it was the New York times says that Trump was engaged in these\nTax schemes that Trump was doing all this uh you know shady behind the scenes um evading or what was due the government enemy Fred Trump pure and from a Donald Trump is well\nThey're saying this and we turn around and say well hold on a second this will never be adjudicated this will never see the inside of the court so how do we do if they're telling the truth about this or not is anyone really going to dive into the hundred thousand pages and also\nWhat is the shady tax dealing really mean do they have them ... writes on tax evasion no of course not they're saying that he did this and that and try to find all these different ways to avoid paying taxes really and avoidance of taxes is not criminal\nAvoidance of taxes is\nTaking advantage of the fact that the tax code is Seventy thousand plus pages it's ... it's a disaster\nBut liberals don't want to change it because they like it and the government like that and Republicans unfortunately in the Congress like it too because that's the single biggest\nWay that they can influence policy and engage in doling out favors to people which is the tax code\nI mean you you make changes the ... changed the whole country got to pass legislation you need the other side so that people pay attention that can be harder changes in the tax code giving people carve outs and giveaways wide Seventy thousand pages because it's a way for the Congress to pick winners and losers and do favors for donors\nSo Trump\nTries to elaborate just the way that a lot of other folks do jury has in the past\nTwo I think it's good though I think we should have a flat tax and people say no book a fair tax whatever something like that it should be on a postcard that was one of the things that really did like about the cruise candidates the I Will say that he was very opposed the IRS and the way that it's currently constituted but it's based on Trump is just\nIt's boring long winded and there's not nearly as much there there they'd like to think even though they've said they've gone through a hundred thousand pages\nMust be must be must get tiresome to be such a a relentless Trump paid or after a while but the New York times I guess this is just\nThis is what pushes them on you know this is what gets them going they really just want to focus in on how terrible Trump is at all times however they can whenever they can\nAnd they never get tired of it you know it is also know the economy so now we're talking about next will get us national security third hour we'll talk about these crazy academic papers that give you a little window into the looney left that's all coming up\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry

using express VPN\nWhenever you think about that keep in mind that that doesn't really that shouldn't really mad\nThat stuff is all a distraction that's just that's just really a an emotional breakdown ... emotional breakdown of the progressive left that's happening in real time\nOn the things on the issues that matter we are not at war in terms of active military hostilities do not have a massive occupation of a foreign country with an insurgency waging against us raging against us under way we have\nA an economy that's doing fantastically\nWell we have a mainstream media that's being held to account and ways they never happy for me the media showed his last couple of weeks if they're not the enemy of the people they're definitely not on our team oh you know I people complain so much yeah I Know it has some totalitarian ... when you say to me that people because it was a phrase and the Soviet Union but\nOn the merits it's true I mean he has a bunch of liars bunch of clowns\nSomebody finally will say it out with somebody with a megaphone that's big enough that they can't ruin number shut them down or shout him down\nThey're losing power that's what this whole thing is about that's why they're so upset I think that's a great thing for the country I think people should be much more discerning an honest or rather discerning about where they get the information and expect greater honesty and and the people giving it to them\nYou know if CNN wants to say we are an arm of the DNC which they are and that's our that's what we do day in and day out as
