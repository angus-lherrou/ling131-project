Republicans in the ... uh it looked really positive we don't there hasn't been enough of it to necessarily know that the two two are tied but it does seem like\nI'm a real positive things have happened in red states where Republicans were a little bit on the ropes at one point um for example give you a Ted Cruz Chevy Cruze going up against Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman\nYou may you know bad oh yeah oh yeah they go oh Ashville most Irish people are called better so you point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls there's one poll that had him tied at one point\nUm of several polls showed cruise only up by one or two New York times doing something really really interesting in which normally you kind of see\nThe ... news well I didn't do that and uh they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a sporting event like the ... a football game happens and then you score after right like you're not seeing the play by play the game with a poll you're only seeing the results that in\nNew York times is trying something this cycle that's different which is there actually showing you as they make the calls\nWho's voting for who when you see the poll build slowly as you watch it it's addicting to watch uh and uh\nIt's kind of interesting because one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get anybody to agree I at one point yesterday um the Texas Senate poll they had made Seventeen thousand seven hundred phone calls\nAnd had two hundred and eighty five people who like that's how hard it is for them to get people on the phone anymore to take these pools which is it's part of that and why it's hard to read\nYou know 'cause

honest I could probably happen sometime pretty soon but they were acting like this was some\nCrazy thing that he had ... talk to him and say oh he's profane the uh profane the office of the presidency by doing this by cursing in there you know this is the same office literally V. office the oval office where Bill Clinton did a whole lot\nMore in a way of profane stuff then have a guest who cursed\nBut there are no standards the media really applies to any there's there's no there's no truth necessary for what they say oh they just want to find ways to hate and to criticize the president and there's always ways to do that here's a perfect example\nOf what I'm Talking about John of Brazil\nWhom I managed to a debate a few times in the CNN and who was always treated with tremendous difference I mean they really love Donna Brazil at CNN so I was supposed to be there to get\nA buck slapped if you will ... or ... ... you know what I mean fuck yet bucks left\nUm and\nIn turn I actually managed to turn the tables on her\nAnd she told me she interrupted be once told me to stop interrupting her was a pretty amazing thing I don't know some of you may be even seen that but I was never impressed with her oh she has to eat it out\nAnd she is treated out the following in response to this ... this was a I think she was she was DNC chair German and then she gave the questions to Hillary remember he got fired from CNN\nShe treated at the following an in response to this whole commenting today Kanye West has set us back one hundred and fifty five years\nWish Sojourner Truth could've met with him outside the White House and Frederick Douglass inside the oval office Brock Obama never would have become president with this crap but lets me Kanye on election day by voting for Democrats I mean that the end of that is fine if she wants to propagandize were Democrats she's totally free to do that\nBut just say that ... has set back\nUh I I guess when she says set us back I wouldn't want to put words in her mouth but I'm assuming she means the black community\nSet us back a hundred and fifty five years well this one does the math on that it seems a bug she's making a pretty pointed reference there and how is that what a reasonable rational person would say\nHere you have a world famous black millionaire in the oval office embracing the president of the literally embracing I'm giving him a hug and\nSharing ideas with them and sharing lunch with him this is the leader of the free world\nThis is a man talking about Trump now Tanya probably thinks he's a leader of the free world among other things among being a deity a but there's no ... there's no way any ... normal human being could look at this and say yeah that's degrading\nFor any group of people never mind for black Americans I mean this is just the oval office\nAnd I think that the way they get to this is two fold one day they hate Trump so much that they're blinded with rage about him all the time but also they don't really accept the Trump is the president they've they have\nThis is this is true about the less now and it explains a lot of explains a lot of their mob mentality and the mob actions in the way that they've been willing to cast aside basic decency and decorum and to justify this behavior to themselves and to others in the media and\nBecause they don't really think that he's the president they think that he is a fraud\nOr he is\nA ... an interlopers he's a pretend or to the throne if you will\nAnd so he doesn't deserve any of the respect that one would give president he doesn't deserve any of the deference to the office if not to the man himself and so if that where your perspective if you were that\nDo looted with with rage\nOr not disconnected from the truth then I could see how maybe you'd feel that ... hugging this man that they think is such a fraud in the oval office and having this very warm report is demeaning but to any normal person that's just

there is no there's nothing to do is we can't we're not going to subpoena any evidence from these people\nIt was all meant to create a parallel process to the legal process that the less can control\nNow impeachment is in fact a parallel process to the legal process that the left can control if they take the house and that's what they're gearing up for so whenever we try to have the argument that Trump was not found guilty\nWhen it comes to Russia collusion of anything they're going to say it doesn't matter this isn't a criminal trial Trump is guilty of malfeasance of high crimes and misdemeanors while in office a which is essentially whatever\nThe house of representatives decides he is guilty of now they can't remove him from office but the biggest feather in their cat they think going into the twenty twenty election is going to be\nThat President Trump was impeached by the President Trump visited impeach president we have to remove him get rid of the corruption get rid of the uh you know the racism\nAnd massage any and sexism and all that stuff that's going on because of Trump's they say and that's a way to the left to avoid the fact that they don't have compelling arguments\nOn policy matters they can't meet us on the battlefield of ideas when it comes to policy so what they do is turn this into a battle of reputational or a reputational fight or somebody's\nYou know the the perception of whether someone is racist or not or perception whether someone's a massage therapist or not and just oh he's a ski don't vote for him he's icky\nWhich is really what they want to convince everybody about Trump all along but there there's a development in his whole Russia thing today or this is what made me think of this\nThat a lawyer for Glenn Simpson this from the hill dot com I my own website where I work uh I don't want us in my own I obviously don't own a time employee cofounder of fusion GPS told the head of the house Judiciary Committee on Thursday\nThat his client will invoke his constitutional rights not to testify ... define ... what does that get pi him take away is pie defying\nA GOP issued subpoenas seeking to compel him to get a closed door deposition the lawyer Joshua leddy toll judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte an electronic letter that Simpson will not participate in this committee's inquiry because it is not designed to discover the truth\n...\nQuote consistent with the September twenty seven twenty anti letter we sent you Mr Sampson who's testimony as a matter of public record will not be participating in a confidential deposition before this committee squirted lawyers for Simpson he'll be invoking his right not satisfying the first and fifth amendments of\nThe constitution ah now I understand\nThat this is where people will say based on their politics well if you take the fifth you must be guilty that's not fair to fit as a procedural protection and there are times when I assure you there will be people that you and I are much more favorably disposed toward who\nWould take the fifth and we would say that it's absolutely the right thing to do so it's not just that he's taking the fifth but it's that there is such a clear pattern in general of people who are tied to the CIA people who were early on big advocates\nOf the whole Russia collusion theory with regard to Trump and the election\nWho want to make sure that that the information does not get out they don't want to testify they don't want subpoenas to be declassified they don't want the release of the ... information they don't want the full scope even of Mueller's probe to become public\nWell went back to the situation I think you do have to ask yourself what the heck is going on here\nYou never see a greater revelation amount of information from this investigation supported by the people that think that Trump is done terrible things it's the people that think that Trump has been set up an ambush tearing smeared\nThey're the ones they're the ones who want more information out there they're the ones who want us to be able to get the facts and get the truth so I just wouldn't know that they are back in office right now because one I think that Muller\nKnows that you know to to put more kinda you know Ricky ...\nOut there oh we're gonna talk some more Russian sock puppets you know they're never going to actually sit in a courtroom that would look really to borrow word from before achy ready for the election so it won't be till after the election and we get more information but the the Democrats are a little bit of a of a little bit of a bind here\nBecause they don't want to over promise\nAnd and they don't want to make it seem like they're trying to throw this mid term based on all the work that they've already done against Trump\nOr I think it's too obvious for them you know so they're they're laying a little low on the Russia collusion stuff\nAnd ... the primary you know that the primary narrative against Trump is very much personal and I think they go more for the twenty Fifth Amendment\nLane here than anything else you know they're trying to say that Trump is just unfit for office instead of

thousand dollars more from taxes all of a sudden out of nowhere they getting killed thousands that tell a lot of money to people\nAnd I think that there are a lot of a lot of people who hate Trump as I've said many times\nBecause he is so far a successful president meaning that that they they hate him even more now that it is clear that he's actually up to the task I mean they they can say as much as they warned about oh a drop in twenty two at the moment we should get rid of him but they really despise this man because he's been\nAble to do such a strong job in the position now forget about they'll say his tone is terrible he's a racist and oh my God you know bring up all this stuff\nThe country and how it functions right now is strong it's going well everything is moving in the I should say everything but in general there's a feeling of optimism about the nation are certainly optimism about the the economy\nBut they they despise trumping I I also think\nThat when we start to evaluate why is that we have some of these was there was a couple of Saddam and these are related and and I'm just really thinking out loud on this one but it's something that's been on my mind for a while teams all share with you you know you have these these never Trump or types\nWho have some of them have gone straight up Democrat now I mean they have actually switch teams officially although a lot of them might as well of switch team or that they can say they're not never Trump but for all intents and purposes they are a but why is it that they\nUm they hate this president so much and that there are so many people who come from\n... not exclusively government backgrounds but I I think come from backgrounds where they've spent time in government and they're of the system and all the establishment and they have this guy I really do think that they hate him because one\nHe isn't supposed to be able to do this and I can tell you that there's a lot of people in the government\nWho really like to think that they have some magic powers of of thoughts and an organization and management of that other people don't have right at that once you become a government employee long enough because\nHe become culturally acclimated from being within this bureaucracy to think that there's something that\nThe you know you have to be in government to understand government that's that's essentially the distillation of this point you have to be in government to understand it you know you have to have been a beltway inside or or you've had to had to run for elected office time and time again essentially you've got to be part of the professional\nPolitical class not necessarily a politician but part of the professional political class in order to be competed in these roles and it's just not true\nAnd I think that makes a lot of people who have power in this country a lot of people who are part of the elites and the establishment to feel uncomfortable because they've built their careers and their reputations on the notion that well you know I've you know the the the Gergen effect\nOr work for for June perjure ensure Roger every president since advisory more words and you know ... or ... horse and buggy whip it offers\nYou know you get these guys do the whole\nTheir whole resume is this long stretch of government work and and different government jobs the idea of being well they must understand they must make better decisions they must know this stuff better than somebody like a Trump who just has existed in the private sector and the real world\nAnd hasn't made this

like that this president is able to do this because he's not supposed to be able to do this he he brings out Trump brings out\nAnd also it but this the insecurity of losers in a way that is very

was the fastest hurricane anybody said it just was feeding him it wasn't that would be absolutely nothing left because I just spoke with Governor Scott they're very happy food is being now following\nHurricane being brought in a way of unbelievable large amounts of water\nAnd everything that people can watch the electric companies have been a\nTerrific they're already working on the roads are being cleared out many trees are in the path of the electric companies [noise] ah the roads are being claimed right now they're being ah for the most part they're open enough to get the electric companies and and a lot of electricity is already\nBack on some of the false electricity goes already found that's in Florida they're following up in Georgia\nSo the Trump Administration\nIs showing competence and doing what the federal government can to help respond in a situation like this obviously it was a really nasty hurricane it was a two and then it came up with category for wins move really fast a but one interesting side of this and the first priority the first thought of everybody is\nGetting help to those who needed and making sure that there's no word minimum loss of life and they're going to lives lost so far but as we know it can often be the aftermath where much of the damage is done in terms of the human cost\nOf but hurricane Michael a hit and they're used to be this\nI guess you'd call it a gentleman's agreement a gentleman's agreement among politicians that are when something like this goes on you will you will see their political attack ad that was not the case here folks\nAh you had Ron dissent is his rival Andrew Gillum getting hit with some uh some ads you had\nA the the democratic superPAC\nThat is trying to help Bill Nelson and Florida take down his opponent governor Rick Rick Scott they called\nThem a shady millionaire and the ad by the way John I'd like to be a shady millionaire that sounds like fun you know\nBeing a millionaire would be great but a shady millionaire sounds like you're the kind of a million or that has parties on his yacht and has a little too much fun so I think that sounds good to me but they're they're running these these attack ads um and and people were pointing out that that\nIs a different thing than what you you would usually expect remember running attack at the ... in this state that is getting just battered while it was getting better by this hurricane and they're running ads specifically on the opponent inability to respond to the hurricane\nSo usually you wait for a politicization\nOf these things I think it would hurt Cain response is fair game to criticize politicians for I'm not saying that but usually you wait for the politics to fly into into literally the storm has passed and in this case the uh the candidates running these ads even while the while the storm was was overhead and people were\nTrying to other bad down the ... or ...\nOr or wait until they can return to their homes by the footage of it is just the devastation I I Know that you know the the news channels because it's such a visceral human reaction to seeing you know we all think what would it be like if I lost my home what would it feel like if I had to flee a natural disaster like this and so we\nYou see those images you're immediately drawn to it and I and I know that there's something of a of a news cliche here with all the coverage going on of of a of a hurricane like this but there there was this political backs Georgia which which I think\nAlso a illuminates how tight these Porter races are people are going to look to the Florida governor's race a and between Gillum and ... and Scott and they're going to look to the the Senate race 'em and they're going to try to extrapolate\nFrom that for the implications for the presidential race and twenty twenty you know the idea here being that give them who's a a young African American guy mayor of Tallahassee very progressive very left wing I think would be really damaging the state of Florida with the policies that he's opposing he's one of these guys who's\nYou know ... if he's not outward I think he is for single payer outwardly so I I should probably but if he's not outwardly for single payer you might as well be\nA but you know they they certainly are drawing some comparisons between him and Brock Obama he's young he's telegenic he's African American\nUm and and that's what the progressive base wants to see\nIn their new candidates they want to see the minority representation they want females they want a ... and specifically for those reasons you know conservatives ... we like having people from all backgrounds but we just like having the best people\nOf identity politics is a is such a big factor on the left these days that they really get very excited about this stuff\nBut the Florida races are going to be very very tight and and so tight that they're not wasting even a single day while they are getting slammed by category for hurricane to take the ads or take the negative ads off the air so I think that gives you a sense of aware that all is\nAnd uh I I Do believe Scott's going to pull it out but it's your own guys going to make is going to make a close very close\nOh I've I've got something by the way that I've been meaning to get to all week with you um and I just I've been waiting to have a night where

I I haven't read yet how but I I Would guess they probably you know tortured him and beat him to death\nOf rural murder and then just remembering his body putting his body parts into bags and disposing of them in fact one Mideast based paper although it's\nIt's funded by the country so you know take it with a grain of salt one Mideast based paper claims they have a source telling them that the body parts of ...\nSo the anti Saudi journalist that's been murder that's missing has now turned into this global story his body parts may be buried in the residents of the consul general of ah of Saudi Arabia in Turkey so this guy's centuries of senior Saudi official may may have these body parts barriers backyard\nAnd this is crazy folks either this is if you read about this in a fiction novel you'd say come on\nThat so that so outrageous not only is this not you know this is not the kind of guy you can disappear\nAnd I and I want to get into a little bit of well what does that tell us about the Saudi motivations are by the Saudis are saying what we'd expect which is of course you know they think that he left and they don't they don't they don't accept any responsibility for this nothing happened this is all crazy conspiracy theories you know you could assume all that\nUm but then then that'll get at some of the complicating factors here but the Turks have\nPretty good intelligence and police forces and plenty of surveillance cameras and other ways of figure out what went on here and sort of Saturday's to do this on Turkish soil instead of trying to lure ... back to Saudi Arabia if you went to Saudi ... we wouldn't you know he would have just disappeared and nobody would know\nSo they did this in Turkey a well keep in mind that a ... show was a permanent resident of the U.S now he had gone into a a a self imposed\nA self imposed exile of sorts here in the states\nBut that the Saudis would do this just show brazen and now you have all these different politicians you'll Lindsey Graham said there'll be hell to pay you know I like Lindsey now is you know hey I like Lindsey did the right thing in the Capitol hearing I'm I've always been okay with Lindsey Graham but now I'm I'm pretty pro Lindsey\nBut people are saying is going to be held to pay a seems increasingly likely that the Saudis will just deny deny deny but the overwhelming weight of the evidence is that this was a a brutal broad daylight\nYou know ours assassination inside a diplomatic facility on another country's soil this is the kind of stuff that that you do cut off\nYou know relations with a foreign country for because they believe that this was most likely ordered at the very top of the Saudi Government or at least there was consent for given at the very top level Saudi Government perhaps by NBS himself\nThis is crazy this does not happen\nIf people will say oh by the Russians yeah the Russians have engaged in assassinations of critics and and but they they are tend to be a former Russian nationals they've done in the u._k. I Know but they've never done it in their former Russian nationals which this guy's a former Saudi national but as for Russian national and\nThey never do it in a diplomatic facility though and they certainly wouldn't send multiple private jets with Russian officials I'm not saying that the the Russians are to ethical for this they're just not so foolish as to do this\nBut then you get to the ... the then you get to the book then you get to the point where you have to ask is hold on a second\nDid the Saudis do it this way to send an even stronger message I often tell you on this show and are set in the past that you know sometimes burning dung village sends an even stronger message you know we're burning down the whole village and not just one house obviously sense a stronger message too\nBut you don't have to burn down everything you can just make an example of one and here you have a very high profile\nCritic Washington Post columnist who was writing about all of\nThe really what what is the mafia state and the Saudis or a mafia stayed with a religious veneer I mean there but Saudi Arabia is a is a a ... you know the ruling family has enriched itself to the tune of\nWho knows how many billions of I mean hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of of decades there's Saudi families incredibly rich and the Saudis are as you know very repressive goes all the way back to the unholy\nAlthough they would have thought it was holy alliance between the uh fundamentalist preacher on the Arabian Peninsula even Abdul how from the Eighteen century\nLibby was born in Seventy two I think he lived about Seventeen Ninety two so liberal maybe Seventy eighty two so Eighteen century preacher who made this deal with the ... who were just warlords and that's how you get Saudi Arabia\nBut they merge together this religious or this religious extremism which is known as ... but they they don't like that term they prefer Salafis and Salafis means the forefathers of the a Muslim face\nThey itself is that what it is fundamentalism such Islamic fundamentalism\nAnd a ... law Mick\nLiberalism texture was although even that is kind of difficult to decipher because if you've ever read the Koran and there's a lot of\nUh but they killed that they've they've\nKilled this guy now and it's going to cause some major problems on the international diplomatic so you know I'll get into why and what the what the end result of all this will be in just a moment we'll talk more about this what\nLooks to be most brazen high profile assassination of a rush that that I can remember stay with the\nSocial media sites are the future of conversation my friends we know this I use it as a powerful tool and reaching out to you and spreading the word about the show\nAnd you use it among your friends and family to share your thoughts on everything that matters to you but we've seen so much of the left wing bias at play in the last few years we know that Facebook and Google and these other massive social media enterprises\nHave all kinds of left wing conversational how shadow banning nonsense going on if you want to put a stop to that we've got a new site for you Snoopy dot com maybe dot com is a place where you can go and share whatever thoughts you want you don't have to worry about moderators administrators\nSuppressing your freedom of expression totally free to join check it out for\nYourself as an I.
