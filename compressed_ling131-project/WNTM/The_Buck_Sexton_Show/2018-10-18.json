treasury treasury official has been charged with leaking sensitive bank information to\nA reporter oh that's right\nThen employee at treasuries financial crimes enforcement network was arrested and charged with disclosing banks suspicious activity reports tied Jew who wants to guess what investigation who wants to get past the Russia investigation what a shock\nSo here's somebody who is a government employee\nWho thought you know what I'll do to try to jam up somebody in Trump's orbit I've read today that they think it was about Michael Cohen's finances they had the wrong Michael Cohen though there's more than one a and released this information to it is believed buzzfeed news\nAnd bus be of course then there's this whole story now that's not\nConfirmed yet but that is what I've read they think happens here\nI'm so quote the criminal complaint against ms Edwards allege that she leaked materials that led to about a dozen articles in twenty Seventeen and twenty Eighteen pertaining to among other people in matters Paul Manafort Richard Gates Maria Butina the Russian ambassador to Washington a unit of pressures on holdings a Russian company entangled any money laundering\nCase\nBuzzfeed reporter who isn't I okay it is a budget isn't identify the charges is Jason Leopold who was listed as an author on all twelve articles sided in the complaint so here's a woman who is taking financial remember these are folks this is not reports about crimes\nDid you say is these are suspicious activity reports this is the equivalent of releasing raw FBI background investigation and then using it for a report oh you mean like the stuff you might get for the ...\nBut this is highly confidential\nLegally protected for good reason because you can destroy someone's business with this oh yeah he was so and so it's got a few a few suspicious financial transactions you know what that means nothing\nIt means the government flags it and then they might look into it a little bit it does not mean that anyone has broken the law in fact the vast majority of them do not involve\nLaw breaking but here's somebody who\nForty year old woman thought that she would leak this information to the press to hurt Trump and his associates that she would break her oath that you would violate the law and ruined her career and now I now probably her life along with it because it was just a sad important to try to get Trump\nDo you remember anybody during the Obama years from the federal government who was it the ... ... to go after Obama and hurt Obama do you remember anyone who was leaking classified information\nOr sensitive information about individuals and businesses right this is stuff ... on on anybody it doesn't even intelligence world stuff is there are there could be a suspicious financial transaction just because you put a thousand dollars in cash in the bank you know maybe a lot of banks sale\n\nThat's why they keep this stuff so close hold that's also why the IRS actually tries to protect people's information because they understand that if ... if it gets out there it can do a lot of damage that people's reputations will be harmed by this\nSo you have to wonder how many other federal government employees were willing to break the law and share information with the left wing press to embarrass the administration was there was ... from what I understand\nThere was nothing in any of this that tied to Trump was just people around him understand this though it sends a message sends it very\nClear message if you worked for Trump if you work with Trump\nYou could be the subject of this kind of government activism somebody within the bowels of the bureaucracy with high level sensitive access could decide to release information about you too I'm not saying it will happen to you but now it's something you have to think about isn't it and it's not\nJust people that worked for Trump how vocal you're going to be in your support for Trump how willing are you to stand up publicly and say this and then what is the [noise]\nAll that you would encourage you'd be willing to incur in order to continue speaking you know\nThey are waging a form of psychological warfare with these kinds of activities oh just this one how about the guy who ... a bunch of ... a Republican members of Congress who worked in the Congress but all their private information out there that's the kind of stuff that makes ... wife sleep with a loaded gun under her bed now\nThis isn't a one off these people are doing this stuff who leaked the conversation between General Flynn and the ambassador from Russia circa ...\nWho did I haven't found that person yet I think it was a very senior Obama administration holdover I've got some guesses horrific abuse of national security power and the destruction of individuals privacy\nThat's how they play the game they will break the law they will weaponize the government against us and then we'll turn around and say why are you still I mean when we win because we have superior arguments [noise]\n'cause we're right [noise] and they can cry that could whine about this as much as they want [noise]\nDon't ever forget that [noise]\nI've got some thoughts on the show the\nDebacle our sure those with you and what what ... what's the biggest problem the media dresses your oh that's right it's Trump's full we'll

G good guy\nWhen he ... the people that are always talking about Trump is too cozy with dictators he just says look at the actions look what he does\nI mean you know Trump has his way of trying to embrace shoot him so he's trying to do his own high level diplomacy with these foreign heads of state\nAnd this whole standard that they set up is nonsense a standard that you know Trump passed to talk or you know\nSuper aggressively to check everybody and he needs to hold Newton account\nIs just nonsense this is complete and utter nonsense\nBut this is what they pretend is the new standard under Trump that he that he should go into meetings with prudent and Kim Jong un these others and essentially spit in their faces\nAnd anything short of that show that he's a coward anything short of that shows that he's a bad guy or you know they're they're not operating\nIn good faith and I think that's really essential\nWe can't lose sight of that they they're not criticizing the president because they really want to do something differently it's all just an excuse for Trump rage that hey Trump ... that's what this is whether it's foreign policy the economy immigration every criticism of Trump from the less\nNow is infused with this anti Trump rage oh you know they aren't really that caused those anti father should be anti trust anti Trump She did there she had a ...\nI I Am so sick of all the grandstanding on this on this ... issue and I also think that people are really over selling overestimating how much of this is our fault in our problem how much of this is something

want to make predictions we have great poll numbers we have tremendous turnout at these rallies thousands and thousands of people more than we can hold this enthusiasm like we had at\nYou know the last election twenty sixteen which was quite a spectacular day and everything [noise] I think we have\nA lot of enthusiasm and I keep hearing about the enthusiasm to blue wave [laughter] but I think we have tremendous centers yeah\nI Do think we have a lot of enthusiasm and I spoke to Donald Trump junior yesterday and sure enough\nHe uh he is I I could tell very optimistic about how it's looking for the Republicans going into the midterms you know I think that he's I'm really feeling it when he's going out there and meeting with all these different people on the campaign trail\nBut you know the this is going to be very close it's going to be very very tight indeed and there was one thing that Trump brought up in that same interview a I think it was not same interview that that is really got me a concerned and it has to do with what happens if the economy\nTakes a nosedive and if if if it's cyclical I don't think that's going to necessarily be on Trump play a clip six\nPatient or anything in this country and say oh this guy but there's no inflation is very low on tape Powell my thing is that because the fed is amazing race is too fast and it's independent so I don't think\nToo um [laughter] I'm not happy with what he's doing because as going too fast because he looked at the last ... numbers are very low\nThis is going to result in some painful stuff going forward or this is going to be an issue\nAnd I would say this there were people that were writing books right after the crash in two thousand nine saying things like you know this time is a this time is different or how this is a unique\nAnd uniquely dangerous moment in our economic history and and there was a there was a real clarity around we're in uncharted territory here starting in\nTwo thousand or ... or so and I think we've been a little complacent for a while now even the debt Twenty one trillion dollars we've reached the point where there's all this prosperity Trump is cutting regulations cut taxes so much good stuff is happening\nAround the country and sure enough I'm what I think we're starting to see now is an understanding that there is going to be some rough water that's a very gentle way I think of saying it as a result of\nUnraveling all this all this money we put out in the system all this\nChewy and these things that have been done last ten years to keep the economy going to try and and do you know Keynesian stimulus and you know you have people like Krugman who are saying oh this stimulus isn't enough right that was the problem them but we spent all this money\nAnd you have an enormous or a series of enormous debt bubbles a student loan debt trillion dollars credit card debt trillion dollars auto loans especially subprime auto loans very very high uh we're more indebted now\nThan when we were at the time of crisis in many ways and you know deeper and deeper in debt we are deeper in debt when it comes to national debt and we haven't really fixed any of this stuff structurally now be impossible for Trump to fix it right away but here's my concern that I'm not I cannot do\nEconomic prognostications I really can't right that's not something that is in my daily way political stuff maybe national security stuff shore but\nHere's where I see there being an issue right now and ... and that's your chew John and uh all these other groups out there the far left wackos\nAre considered very fringe will you'll notice that the the media apparatus in general is very slow to condemn them and generally uh does not seek to um\nYou know talk about them any more than they have to and I think it's\nBecause they do have a certain ideological solidarity with the right they maybe they don't agree with all of what ... does all of its rhetoric but they like that they view themselves as resistance to Trump bright they like it they view themselves as a opposite oppositional and willing to\nTake action about all this and with that\nUh I I think we have to remember that they could very quickly become a much bigger part of the political conversation if this is the ... this is what worries me if we have a major economic\nA reset right if the debt turns into a crisis if all of a sudden we we get to the point where the rising interest rates means that we're paying more and more money just because of the money we've already spent like that interest payments on the debt start to crowd out the private sector and the and the rest of our economy\nIn the face of a ... of his boss\nI guess it was born Michael's but it might have been somebody else screams based on quitting on not at all thing and then when he went home and it was over the weekend you realize oh my gosh what am I don't I don't have a job a that was a great job I made a terrible mistake and then he didn't know what to do and thought and fallen thought and then he figured he figured you know what\nI think he talked to a friend who told him and do this if I remember the story right which I might be missing some of the details\nAnd he just showed up to work on Monday and pretended like nothing had happened\nAnd it worked\nEveryone just acted like he was fine and you just you know they maybe they forgot the meltdown or just chose to ignore the whole thing but they they wanted him there and he showed up and everyone just went about their business no he said there was not even a conversation about it [noise]\nAh so I think that's what Elizabeth Warren think she's going to do when it comes running for the presidency I think are approaches hey America let's just pretend that that whole thing\nDidn't happen let's just get past the whole DNA thing and\nI'm Still your progressive heroine right let let's pretend that that's the case show um that's not going to fly\nAnd we heard there from Debbie White delve a poor echo who is the descendant of the real Pocahontas Pocahontas was a real person it's you know John Smith book honest although I gotta say John I think that the Pocahontas animated Disney film is one of the weaker ones not not good\nCan you she was all the colors of the mountain I don't even know what that means right and that was not particularly in June you get the idea you know what I'm Talking about some of the some of the young would listen to like yeah I liked the Pocahontas but yeah it's fine\nI mean the best which is actually to you know I Know people are going to get married for this one I think you gotta figure the best animated Disney movie\nIt's tied for me between a landing in Lion King I mean their their neck and neck I think those are those are two of the best\nI'm also very partial to beauty and the beast of I Know it's a little more for him to be a little more for the ladies but it's very well done was the first animated film ever nominate for us to okay bakar poker back to the center of the real Pocahontas habit uh what what you saw here was that the left\nHas this whole framework of something they call cultural appropriation right the last has this framework where they will say\nUm you are not allowed to make the cuisine of another of another culture yeah you're not allowed to wear the uh the garb of another culture\nAnd cultural appropriation let me just say is a stupid concept because all culture borrows and steals and it influenced by other cultures all the time\nIn fact if you were to look back at what we consider to be western fashion a lot of the most well known western fashions today come from\nFrom other parts of the world are ... are from fabrics that we're only possible because of colonialism and I mean there's there's a lot of stuff\nSo I mean you were like oh you mean like Muslim city of Mosul for example a you know getting a pattern from Malaysia getting I mean you think of as a very ... be northern northeastern American kind of a thing but no\nUh comes from Malaysia ah Sears sucker comes from India you've heard me talk about that before so\nCoal culture is always changing and shifting and we should celebrate anything that's good at any culture right is this notion that people have a a particular claim on a culture strikes me as odd to begin with but if you're going to be policing appropriation\nThen for somebody who is as white as Elizabeth Warren\nTo claim that she was a Native Americans specifically for the benefits they're all but also\nReally to to to have some kind of an identity to make her a more interesting person which I think was all part of this I mean she wrote in she was a fake Cherokee who wrote into a cook book called powwow chow\nAnd stole a recipe from my real French chef and called it a charity recipe so it's a fake charity stealing from a French chef to make a fake Cherokee recipe\nWow\nThat is this is the person who wants to be the next president states by the way you know there are a lot of personal failings there are a lot of things that I think I you know you could point you in any number of people and say you know that I could have made that mistake you know\nThere's there's there's certain things that you can feel a little bit of a personal understanding\nOf it and say you know what that person may be across the line with that or\nThat went bad but\nI can understand how it got there I can understand what the circumstances were that led to it a being that way I'm pretending or Native American for many many years is not one of them are and and I\nPlayed that story for yesterday where she talked about her mom and how her mom was dealing with the sting of racism because of her Cherokee family really\nTheir parents were\nOr you know that that the parents involved here were worried about the grandparents I guess for Elizabeth Warren\nAbout a maybe eight\nNine ten generation back Native American ancestor that's a that's pretty crazy that's pretty well but cultural appropriation\nWas always destined to collapse under its own stupidity and the moment that it is politically advantageous to less will try it out once again unless it oh no you can't do that you can't wear that kind of costume oh I saw this stupid\nHulu all these platforms are just overrun by lives can't we just get some normal people involved oh\nWho had something about you know this Halloween you don't wear a costume that's offensive twenty culture or a culture ancestry or whatever\nOkay so now that means no no no costumes or somebody dressed as a Native American garbage can dress up as Pocahontas you can dress up as any of the foreign Disney Princess is\nA ... and I just wonder you know what but if you're if you're a non white then under liberal rules do you have the right to dress up as anything that's not as any person or you know any entity that non white for a Halloween then\nSo is it really just white people that are allowed to dress up in and cultural gar\nThat's not you know I guess I could wear a Viking ... I mean I could wear a Viking thing\nBut I don't know I don't know what the rules are and here's what offer you I don't think the left knows what the rules are either I mean I think that they\nIn general just make it up as they go along and this is just a power trip it's all a power to remember political correctness started out as a means of trying to rebalance powered for what they thought were a under represented in discriminated minorities but with time political correctness is just turn into a weapon\nFor those who want to use those groups and I'm Talking about white liberals now for their own purposes\nRight to use those groups for their own power\nAppropriation as stupid term but bottom line here is that if what Elizabeth Warren did knock cultural appropriation [noise]\nThere is no such thing\nHe does not exist even for ...

reality of trying to deal with them um and by the way ... essentially endorsing bitch anything goes at any cost attitude play Thirteen\n[noise] they weren't they\nAnd what's your guess where they\nSay that I have to worry about that\nLater on\nYou see she's saying and this is part of the disconnect you have from a left she saying on the one hand do you have to do to win big\nRight do whatever you got to do I mean that that's really what follows these views on the do whatever you got to do I just don't let the Republicans win\nAnd then the same time she's saying but I refused to let the Republicans you know she she goes from anything goes just wind power to oh I'm so outraged that how how rough the Republicans play this game this reminds you what we saw after Kavanaugh after the Kavanaugh\nTravesty that was televised for the whole nation is the after all that\nDemocrats didn't take a step back and say you know maybe we shouldn't have been psychopathic about this maybe we shouldn't have tried to enrich your lipstick fashion torture man on TV in front of his wife and children tens of millions of Americans were watching because we just really want a Supreme Court justice there that agrees with us ideologically that's all it was\nWasn't about women wasn't about sexual assault that was all part of\nThe smear campaign\nThat was the plan all along it was about power it was about a Supreme Court seat but their take away from that\nWasn't okay hold on a second maybe we shouldn't have gone quite so dirty maybe we shouldn't have taken it to such extreme lengths and engage in such represents behavior know they came within the Republicans were playing so mean\nThe Republicans were so mean to editor in chief of political\nWrote an editorial he says you know I guess the gloves has to come off though if that's the gloves on meaning Kavanaugh and what they did the gloves off I'm Sorry I mean gloves off after what they did a cabinet could only mean violence and and widespread civil disobedience and and writing in the streets I mean there's just\nThere's nothing else you know that if you're going to take it to the level of 'cause remember they didn't just want to destroy capitals chair 'cause they were talking about trying to trying to dredge up criminal charges against him oh there's no statute of limitations in Maryland oh there should be a criminal investigation all she's ready to go to the police\nThey wanted him in prison they want her to use the state to lock\nUp cabinet not just stop him from the Supreme Court they will do anything as long as it was going to destroy and they thought that wasn't enough they thought that was playing by gentlemen Lee rules\nHow do you have a conversation with people like that how do you have a discussion with people who take that approach the answer is I I don't know what to call you can do you stay true to yourself stay strong and when\nI'm now seeing the wisdom of Donald Trump telling us all that we're going to win so much we're going to get tired of winning we need you\nThe alternative is putting people in positions of power who cannot be trusted with it who do not act with decency who do not act in good faith do not care about the law\nAnd which perhaps most disturbing voice they don't even recognize those things anymore they're so ruthless they don't even understand that they are

don't think of myself as an ex CNN commentator technically that's true but you know I was just there for a little bit I I don't know but your shoveling\nStuff although they didn't say stop to score cheap points obviously this person writing as a media to lips I wanted to go with a big line from the CNN\nSo a senior CNN executives throwing down with ... and this according to media I'd a former political commentator for the network after the conservative pundit criticized the network's coverage of Elizabeth Warren's ancestry\nThe ... began after the right wing host of the hill TV posted a critique of seeing as reporting on wards attempt to prove or Native American heritage Warren's claim has been a source of criticism for years this week's you open yourself to scrutiny\nOr again since or DNA test results day her Native American ancestry might about the only one in one thousand and twenty four so here's what I wrote folks um\nIt's a good thing CNN wasn't blatantly complicit in the massive on forced air award pulled yesterday that would've been really embarrassing oh\nWait a minute and I had below that Elizabeth Warren dishes the CNN politics headline Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of native and Native American ancestry no strong evidence is in quotes\nBut that's ... that's hysterical right I mean this would be like this will be like running with a headline that says you know for somebody that was caught on video you know that that that is and it's already confessed\nThe murder be like a man accused of murder not guilty in quotes and they'd be like well it's that that's what his lawyer said okay but is that you're making an analytic judgment by pulling that out in the strong evidence it it's not strong it's garbage is not strong\nEvidence knowing Dixon strong evidence they would never do that typically Republican all anyway\nSo this year the intention of CNN vice president of communications oh Matt ... never heard of this part of my life who defended the network's coverage well accusing sexy enough not actually reading the piece I read the piece but thanks that that's cute anyway\nMatt wrote to me see how strong evidence isn't in quotes that means it's a phrase attributed to someone other than the author it's almost like you didn't read the article or watch our coverage oh wait\nA okay Matt well I did read the article and I did see your coverage because CNN is on the news room where I work all day long so yes I saw lots and lots of see it as garbage and it was a appalling stupid though there is that\nA media outlets and from there to fight to get an earth bucks section responds to ...\nHa ha sure dude CNN coverage of war is DNA release was really top notch journalism and your headline wasn't clearly constructed to
