{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "And I think I I think with Sandra Tsing she's off the phone is I think she's trying to somehow rationalize away the fact that she got totally bamboozled\nAnd was in ... ah versus I was hypnotized and I have no control ... ... ... yeah I don't think so\nHighmark\nYes I entered into a a showman contract with a large insurance company and they were supposed to give me a two good pay checks up front\nFor a total of a two hundred and one thousand dollars and then payments for the next seven years I took the trucks down to the bank and a greater new accounts specifically\nFor those are the one check for forty five thousand dollars one through [noise] I Know it was notified by the bank and a set in the mail a return on a stop payment on the second check\nOkay did you did you call them up and just ask why\nI asked why everybody is walking around with their head gone G we've never heard of this happening before\nYou may have to hire a well I wouldn't even hire a lawyer yet a now comes a a letter saying you're clearly in breach of the contract\nI sent him a letter out senator and breach of a\nCar they're ignoring you\nSend it to all the different\n... and ... how long ago how long ago did you send that letter how many weeks ago or\nDays or weeks ago All right well ... couple of weeks ago is not enough time for all that they've had six days to respond I Know but they do and I just I ... I just had\nOne of those where it was a settlement that no we entered into my company entered into where we're going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job who had insurance so we settled at\nAnd they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company ... they ended up paying within Seventy five days it how long it took us to get paid\nOkay and to the point where our lawyer had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement had to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we actually had to file a lawsuit\nFor breach before they paid okay so mark just get really aggressive or if they ... you probably felt some of the ... uh if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid more there's no question and then turn around and see how much interest you're paying ... small claims court for the interest you lost\nThrough OK well you'll get paid more guy it's ... it that's the world of insurance they're they grab your your your second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance ear canceled\nSeventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark and that's typically what the payment or the timeline normally is\nGo figure huh oh hey Gary welcome to handle on law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine ... thirty nine home uh we when we bought the house um where would give it a a gives me the fan are that are\nLimited what we could do a lot of what we can do with our own\nAnd one of the stipulations of the the the and are fed that\nEach of the home has to be built on a single a lot and um that each home had to be at least Seventy five feet wide there are other stipulation\nBut what happened was a developer got to the city of Ventura uh the city approved the flooding of the law and now the developer is building two homes\nThat are in violation of the CBC in are in a number of different ways\nOkay so I wanted to know what our record\nTheory on now you are you what you do is you get the homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against them just because of the city allows a a certain type of building or the or the community that is the age away also can control\nAnd they can say no one more than one lied or one home per ... now I then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back and saying you're violating liability\nOr to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winner here in my opinion would be the H away but you you it's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney\nOr it is a real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use and there are a attorneys out there and then in fact represent nothing but H always [noise] okay\nSo you get to go just go on the uh go on the Internet and check them out because that is I Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's no way in hell especially if you're building additional homes that's big money for them\nAlright max\nHi good morning to offer yes or buy insurance claim worse [laughter] okay how do you have trouble with an insurance company yeah I sure never heard that one before ever ... about it for\nA while now asking [laughter] anyway ah anyway they shorted me based on the estimate of space for Mitt they shorted me eight hundred thousand dollars [laughter] yeah I called him a couple of times especially they told me to go out and all that\nSaid that is anyway ah anyway when I get I filed in small claims court trade other than maybe seven dollars and the way they came with a check for five hundred\nPound the verbiage on the checks as if I take the check a that negates credit for the claims\nRight now I'm Wondering if I take a check because I Know in ... in court if I take that check me gate to yeah yeah there's a\nBecause that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you would sell is jak then I Will not go after you I waive all my rights absolutely okay so the only way you can go and kick their butts is to say no thank you to the check and go ahead and file and small claims court and kick their butts\nOkay that's that's where I'm going to\nGo look and here's the good news whenever you go in front of a judge small claims judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works normally they would take it right up to superior court and so you're really not going to be in front of the uh\nA judge a small claims judge which are usually not judge has uh an daddy is a and this happens all the time with the companies the immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly however there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nSo you're coming in with an advantage\nDry cleaners never even go to small claims court ever because they know they're gonna lose walking in the door and they just write checks now the good news is they write checks for the amount of replacing a\nDress and I've had\nA pair of pants they know I shop at Costco so when the cash the check [noise] this is handling [noise]\n\n\nThis is Michael men than here with my ... from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe government protects the costs of Medicare plans will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate help markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide help folks maximize their benefits and say honey\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go it alone get unbiased help to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with lower copayments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors\nWith the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistant says freight\nMichael methods for health markets for your free\nMedicare assistance coal eight hundred seven for one twenty nine thirty that's eight hundred seven for one twenty nine thirty eight hundred seven for one twenty nine\nAnd the two nurses who first arrived at the scene to save the rotten filthy life for Robert powers are Jewish\nHow serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers\nAnd if I was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months and I like to know where are the people he communicated with\nWas he on friend that was ... who else knew what he would he was saying the things he was saying and and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great friend of Israel\nAnd Bowers also headed Trump because Trump is the only American president in history they're Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka has become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner\nIs a ah Orthodox Jews the children the president's children are Jews the president has attended many Jewish religious functions is I have\nAnd so this guy who\nAh hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo or one headline Saturday yesterday and the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post\nThat are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they are not in fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt's unbelievable on that day and in fact\nCNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat stimulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that stimulated the stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama I Want to know\nThe media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt at the masses fascination of Republican members of Congress resulting in a motor wounds to Stephen ...\nThe Washington Post the next day ran a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders and also posted\nMany complimentary things about Rachel Maddow so instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter of frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder for many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like sex already defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice and like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it\nBecause all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it\nThere was a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio of course we know about Ted Cruz an ID cruise chased out of restaurants and also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat\nAnd grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media\nDoesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Brett Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist\nAnd so I'm On the right committing acts of violence that has covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion is Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up his trumpet he stabbed to death and people applied\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam began the anti Semite settled a large rally that Jews are termites and thousands in attendance applauded and cheered calling juice termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to had pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight not to allow the public to know that he was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago\nAnd that that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgust me\nThey you know the Ku Klux Klan and the Democrats lynching Democrats they're all Democrats so please can the media set the record straight\nWhen the president said there's good people on both sides the one thought he was referring to\nWear those southerners who wanted to keep southern monuments\nAnd the other side where those protesting he was not referring to the white nationalist carrying tiki torches\nShouting racial and ethnic slurs at night in Charlottesville there is no good people among that group you cannot be a good man or a good woman shouting racial or Jewish lawyers and the southern city at night carrying torches\nThere is no good coming from that that is blatant racism and that's wrong\nLet's continue we'll get your calls from the coast in Wisconsin Ohio Indiana Illinois Nevada Florida New York and California by the way the\nBoston Red Sox are bottom in the seventh ending up four to one [noise] so uh that's because Andrew ... a friend of mine who plays left field\nFor the red Sox I'm rooting for the red Sox\nThose continuous more [noise] still counting hand the great American your calls her next live with you [noise]\n\n\nChances are if you're a homeowner you had something happen in your home and you haven't been able to get anyone else to fix it 'cause it's after hours or you have to pay extra\nHey there I made some for all clear plumbing and drain I'll tell you if you got a plumbing problem give them a call because they don't charge overtime and they have expanded hours\nIn the morning and evening in seven days a week because they understand plumbing problems don't keep business hours give them a call all clear plumbing and drained to find one seven to five oh eight oh eight\nWe're watching out for your cat down we mark NBC Fifteen [laughter]\nRock and roll lovers is any way take a journey back to this week in rock and roll history I start off back in Nineteen sixty six where the Supreme became the first female group to have a number one album us charged with a Supreme that go go knocking the Beatles revolver from the top of the charts\nFrom the all clear plumbing and dream studios clearly the best join his use radio seven ten W. N. T. M.\nFox News I'm like the opposite world recognition of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting tragedy\nTissues for two reasons having to\nCool the French government to hold the government to across Europe

was two years ago is the judiciary better off today than it was two years ago in fact what's going wrong\nIs the unemployment rate better now than it was two years ago or more people working today than two years ago is the American military stronger today than it was two years ago in fact everything it could go writes gone right and not much has gone wrong\nAnd that that's gone wrong largely has not been Trump's doing but other forces he's the president but he's not the ... he's not the dictator is not the czar\nContinue their calls will go right to go to Robin Utah Robin Utah welcome to the bill Cunningham show Rob go ahead\nThanks for taking my call Yes sir thank you\nWell yeah in the middle of the shooting they had Al Sharpton on MSNBC again and I doubt and then on his show\nAgain

furniture Mart I\nMean it Al Sharpton life is filled with anti Semitism any run around with Louis Farrakhan who called ...\nAnd I watched it\nIn a year and I could not have oh\nI Do not I just Google

the Trump children not much of the story at All right now I don't know just being concoction would have actually cause any damage but it was like a fake pipe bomb in other words it was intended to cause fear\nAnd if someone would get that and you open an envelope and you get white powder all over your hands impose on your lap believe me and say fearful tear filled event and this is a regular event that the left does to Republicans and the media doesn't cover it do they\nCover it and you can make rice and I don't care if they're being real\nOh well can you imagine if a bunch of Republicans have done similar things to the Democrats when Obama was in the White House\n[noise] [laughter] oh no you couldn't even bring up but you can bring up anything you know you're going to say a word\nWell Time Warner did this the Trump well what if the parent company of Fox are sponsored a play in Central Park\nThat depicted the murder through repeated stabbing of Iraq Hussein Obama look alike saying

car bomb and held his head to head on stage\nOh Cathy Griffin now is touring the country to sold out audiences\nWhy explained to me Rob why the media doesn't respond to these obvious\nDiscrepancies in
