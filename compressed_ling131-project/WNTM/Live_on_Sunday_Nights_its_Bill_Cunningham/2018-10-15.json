I'm\nOh God I hate these winds All right let's try it ah but starting young\nWe just lost you know there shouldn't be technology out there that overcomes this wouldn't you think by this day and age I mean we can send\nA guide to the moon that doesn't work anymore in the last time there was a guy on the moon was in the seventies so that's kind of stupid so we're going to be able to we can send the guy to Mars\nRight at some point it was so he calls back he calls back All right oh hello Chris welcome to handle on the law Kris bill yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to a ... tax return from Eighteen years ago [noise] it could get a refund of character paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot okay now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from her and like sixteen years [laughter]\nI don't know how to amend a tax return that will join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that\nBecause if the law allows someone\nTo file an amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partner their spouse or ... is not around\nEither can't be found a somewhere out there on remarried died whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS\nBecause the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules and now when you file your tax returns you have an accountant\nChris yeah yeah have you asked your account about this\nYes and he wasn't curve anywhere you could do it then he had and I happen to have an appointment with the Iraq on friday\nThat is under yeah that's the way\nI'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast expertise would not only this is tax law or this or tax returns that of course I you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I shouldn't researcher look it up and am I counting Chris\nJust like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several accountants you make an appointment with the Irish and you didn't mind it\nCould get that that I actually find it might go and uh maybe no picnic or just magically appear\nNo no I I I don't know why I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is do I have\nTo find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her\nAnd that's when I go out that many grand behind the counter right that's another issue in this area and you and and you may\nBe able to get the whole thing okay based on the child support order\nSo I the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to half of that yeah\nNow there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off for a needle grab people's money\nAre cases in that state right now we're character Turkers surrender\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS agent and and if the IRS agent doesn't know that rules specifically and and it doesn't have any experience or or doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's a pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as ... and IRAs Asian who doesn't I understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you've ever look at the Internal Revenue code these our phone books fit\nWith hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally cook real to amend after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask me I would've said no but if they passed a law that is a different than we're in great shape\nIt's for military better yeah obviously are on fabric All right All right so is there any of them out there to get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow description of a very narrow group of people and so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man I'm there's nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything right\nAlso let me tell you about life like here's something they do right and life locked protects your identity and of course\nAnother hack this was Facebook fifty

Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which has destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies which have led to a massive levels of unemployment in black communities\nThey've also Democrats who crippled a black families by embracing welfare writes the penalize married couples who get married it goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all said in a sense to CNN's Don Lemon who laughed with venomous Lee and what these other African Americans were saying\nCan you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they would it be kicked off said but not when their own\nGet to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history which CNN did the Kanye West\nFrom an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly punished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south had control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners head to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist arm of the Democratic party to intimidate\nMurder Lynch suppressed and destroy any political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard\nLater on in the era of Jim Crow why Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy test\nAnd other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause his sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control weight while I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media in Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low\nCriminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity and so what happened and Kanye West\nIs the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jesse ... Peterson the kinds of Lisa rice to any black who steps out of line they're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill\nBy Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints that's why CNN working with the Democratic party must destroy Kanye West\nAnd and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party\nHas done to them and not for them the truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional the black family is completely broken there's no job creation\nThe average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line and begins to express support\nFor a different political outlook he has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book\nBecause it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in line they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm can you think a worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime and poverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs\nWhen you think about how badly the Democratic party is treated blocks the relevant question isn't y con you realize that but why others have not realized why even more black voters had the same ... funny as Kanye West why has it had happened yet well maybe it is\nOne of my time like that can only be here and there will be out of my time\nWhen the weather changes you the NBC did not do stay dry\nFrom the all clear plumbing and dream studios clearly to join his Youth Radio seven ten W.

since the queen city I Love the\nQueen city let's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got him back and he's going to be safer shortly he's in the air just he literally just took

was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure as very happy\nRight now about your wife is that you have to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talking about what was the goal and what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense is not a question of it it's just touch on a human basis they needed and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be right in and South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat us that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were taken so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S MCA and its works good but we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to bank and I said we're going to tax you cars coming in then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south where so\nMany jobs and talking to my every time I can or Mexico we talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs ... don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten
