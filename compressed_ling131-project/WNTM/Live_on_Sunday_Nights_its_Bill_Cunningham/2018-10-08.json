need a written contract but I don't think that's yeah that's going to be particularly important although it might be in a in the case of a a small claim spending on the judge show a you wonder if it's worth something Agnes right the work they did\nNot like what do you think you should pay I don't mean I think you know much about it\nAnd then maybe results so you turn around soon for six hundred

New York about thirty miles west of Albany the state capital Chris ... is with the New York state police\nWho tried tried to rape her\nNot one but for boys she said she said she was in her late teens\nThat she switched it back to Fifteen Years old she said it happened in the Nineteen eighties and then she switched back to Nineteen eighty two practical everything she said turn out to be false now you got to be kind to the woman because she's a allegedly a survivor of sexual assault\nBut part of the deal is when you make certain assertions and if they're refuted as they were by Brett Kavanaugh you got to prove it supposedly she was terrified of small spaces\nTerrified of airplanes then find out from a boyfriend that they want on John's together basically all over the globe she went to Costa Rica\nShe went to Hawaii she went to uh the south Pacific Island she went to French Polynesia she went to Israel she went to Central America she went to Europe all by being terrified of airplanes\nThe boyfriend also said during the six years that he dated her in a sworn statement to the Senate committee she never mentioned a sexual assault never mentioned the name Brett Kavanaugh will shed no fear of flying in fact the flu around islands on single propeller airplanes sitting next to each other\nBut she uh the the the second door theory was a bunch of crap\nBecause he came out that they wanted the second door in their home in twenty eight four years before the therapy session because she wanted to provide an entrance to her therapist to conduct their business as a psychologist inside of her home\nShe also coached a friend about how to take a polygraph test she lied about that\nShe also ah stole money from the boyfriend so all these things that she said Dr Christina forward simply fell apart and now yesterday or today her lawyer Deborah catch came out to say that she doesn't want to pursue the Kavanaugh thing anymore really\nShe's done with it so\nMedia turned out to be liars and thieves in trucks and miscreants every every description that can accuser Debbie ...\nA dusting off the memories polling of Bill Clinton on her as a freshman in college no one supporting her story either she gave for names the FBI they checked out the stories of ... Ramirez shaking his junk and her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of his silent heroes of this\nHas been the porn lawyer Michael ... boy he did a great job for the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous\nAntithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact a cast light away from away from a from a Dr Ford and Debbie ... and put it on sweating nobody believed\nIn fact here's a quote from Senator Collins on Saturday quote\nSome of the allegations against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important\nI'm thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor forward\nBut at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple of girls and use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape this outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parrot it\nPublic statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote\nSo said the Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... is doing a great job representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it\nPlus uh as far as\nSupporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ...\n... I read some way of a experts and independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on wood 'cause it's been on my show many times wrote a column a ... this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin all she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must opposes confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter my sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns\nAnd Van Dyke Perry who spent a combined thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from ... their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done\nPlus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock\nOf American Jurisprudence this writer goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process and fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor Christina forward they completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down to Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans\nAnd show you where we are Steven Kobe or of the Late Show has a terrible late night product I Would never watch but I read this or the Drudge Report this evening\nAerial doom is aerial doom is as a writer on Stephen coal bears the Late Show on CBS she wrote at six thirty six pm on Saturday quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life\nUnquote you see this was never about finding the truth about professor forward she was used like a three dollar steak by a Senator Feinstein and others\nTo make public private information that she wanted to keep private she fit their diatribe it is unbelievable\n... and this writer for the CBS Evening show\nStephen Colbert Errol Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad re ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life\nThey want it to ruin am for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for coming midterms suddenly they were woken the Republican conservative majority and now we're more energized the vote than we've ever been because the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue to take your calls we have thousands on hold millions or lessening the heroes of this fight didn't think I'd ever say this Senator Susan Collins is a hero\nLindsey Graham is a hero Mitch McConnell is a hero unbelievable the losers the mainstream media pedaling in lives in irrelevant sees Senate Democrats demon crashes demon rats as some of them call them the Senate demon rats\nAnd Michael ... who's a loser in a sense but I Want that got to continue appearing with Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon every night and put 'em on keep doing he's doing a great job so it's continuous more your calls at eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up later\nIs that same Julie gun lock the independent women's forum talking from a woman's mothers perspective\nBut once they came out with his wife and his daughters and the girls basketball team then the vicious lies perpetrated a bone and by the Senate by the mainstream media I got on his side completely one hundred percent\nAnd the poor guy will not be able to coach girls basketball anymore north teach at Harvard a lot of his life has done not because there is truthful information or corroborated information in fact it was shown to be false\nIt's because the allegations the title nine proceedings\nBut that were held in the U.S Senate clearly demonstrated that professor Ford was factually wrong in every major point that she had including the fact that she was afraid to fly including the facts you put a second front door in our house\nIncluding the fact that uh there were four witnesses that would corroborate her story including our best girlfriend\nNone of them did everything fell apart every part of it and want her boyfriend came out and laid out in an affidavit to the Senate how many times\nThat professor forward lied and was downplayed completely of course by the Washington Post the New York times and the mainstream media because it didn't fit\nThis was all about destroying Brett Kavanaugh personally to send a message through other Trump nominees this is what waits for you Amy Coney Barrett a judge third part of the sixth circuit us court of appeals this or a judge the judge hardness or wait for you\nAnd so it was about frightening and scaring the next nominee I oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg lives along live off the Supreme Court but in a Youtube video a couple of months old she couldn't identify the fourteenth amendment what it was what it said\nI mean she's obviously at the age of eighty six losing it but she wants to stick it out for the next two years hoping the Democrat wins in twenty twenty which I predict tonight is not going to happen is continuing their cause real cause some Chicago\nIndianapolis New Hampshire Nevada Delaware Wisconsin many other states coming up later in the last hour will be Julie gun lock independent women's forum and also Jesse ...

crashed into an embankment\nBoxes buying yet is that limo heading to a birthday party when the crash occurred this is Fox News [noise]\nYour all for Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly vetted that don't go and read on youth Radio's WN GM I'm\nCounting on the great American I'm not I'm not felt this good in so many years I Can't stand them\nTo rely upon Susan Collins and\nLindsey Graham to be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold bacon in the night she was brilliant going over forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I tried to listen and Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all\nIt seems like slime ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not listen to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees and the U.S Supreme Court and I'm so proud of a bread Kevin O's wife his mom and dad as girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness and title nine\nThat's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl of some sexual assault and most likely did not happen to get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination to witness confronting your accusers all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was a title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses including her river version of the facts from er twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was\nI'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for re election in two years but she ought to\nBut now clowns and fools to come out of the woodwork like Valerie Jarrett open ... fame to run against or in Maine have added\nMust continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure yeah though you know the Democrats claim to care about women but uh over the years or one of the largest\nSupporters has been the pornography industry it I'm just wondering if they really cared about women why did they take money from these people who would like women that way\nFounder Michael evidently the porn lawyer and I think he did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael Lebanon is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky Michael having any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they they did have one criminal prosecution against pornography and that opened the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this you know bad stuff this pilots stuff you see out there\nDuring the porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars that the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in sub spaghetti women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women\nThan their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota and they're really cared about women and sexual assault\nBill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee in ... if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to women these people because uh you know the old effect of the boy who cried wolf you know nobody's going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nWell or if a woman comes forward with ...\nProbably eight or nine times out of ten is correct but every now and then you have the Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges from false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the\nTime but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor Ford I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow'd you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about that second door tell me again about the fear of flying all these things Lewis turned out to be a lie or a misstatement or not true\nYou know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen when she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth\nAnd she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist that she was a attempted rape by four boys\nIn her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kevin Oh it's because he was one boy and by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fair but that it was Kevin Oh but they but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been Brett Kavanaugh you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and they were seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth you're not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when Israeli or left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty drop and turning Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve that four boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and the Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely", "show_name": "Live on Sunday
