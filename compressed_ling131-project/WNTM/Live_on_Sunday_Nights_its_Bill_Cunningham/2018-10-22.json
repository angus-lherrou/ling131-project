D. three mobile\nMigrants back on track moving north I'm an Carrick Fox News Central American migrants streamed through southern Mexico heading toward the United states after making an end run around Mexican agents who briefly ... bought them at the Guatemalan border Fox's William last year that\nIs made an end run this afternoon around Mexican agents who briefly stopped them the numbers of straw to about ten thousand and every time you watch ABC or CNN interview one of them they talk about a gentleman by talking about what Trump wants you to do\nAnd the F. word all these things are shouted against our president they're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn to offer them food and water clothing transportation driving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor board to go north\nAnd so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically\nThe media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur back Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all of the migrants from Central America all of them\nWell there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth American Central Americans and Mexicans somebody like two hundred million would come to America to a hundred million what would that do to our government to our welfare spending door schools draw hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million want to come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they will permit it they will permit\nThat because if you're from other than Mexico to him the other words from Central America and you may go to America there's a magic car that you have to read seeking refugee status and that begins a legal process it will take years\nIn the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled they have enough camps\nThey have enough judicial officers driven up floors are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border so far this year until October first which is what about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand migrants have come to America this year\nFrom a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the courtrooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred and Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who not been heard yet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious\nIf you're from Mexico here illegally you're going to take it right back immediately\nIf you're from Central America you have the right to hear that goes on and on and on and never stops so ah I I'm interested to see\nWhen and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals\nAnd the rest there is no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California taxes through New Mexico through legal migration ... there's no coverage it doesn't exist the murders the rapes and cetera it does not exist remember\nThat nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border\nSixteen of the ... most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party I sat in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world\nWas because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges\nAnd the economy right now\nWith Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea\nTo Russia believing we're about to bust up every new trading necessary to keep to get America back on the even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy extending five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just the ... they're the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work can be put a gun to their head\nThe terrorists are on the run\nISIS is destroyed Iran is on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people\nOpioid issues prison reform marijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently\nBut the media is going to use they think immigration the tank the twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individual is here with a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them\nAccording to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues\nIn Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways that the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue\nOf unbridled migrants walking into America that will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan their vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way\nThrough the magic wand\nThat we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have we're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through ... says he's we take in legally one point one million\nForeigners to come into America take the oath of office and become an American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together\nWe already do that one point one million\nBut I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here\nAnd watch hordes\nOf young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina visibly\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five or ten years from now that will never happen this has fundamentally changed our country this far\nAnd it's going to be much worse\nIf in twenty Eighteen what in two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist do we have the do we have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people\nAre the schools coined in such a fashion or the hospital is ready to go\nOr other bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how is this possible that the most violent places on earth is sending us largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin jacks and coming up later an African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males they figured out that this is not benefit\nThem at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education does it benefit the hospital systems that we have\nThe benefit of any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million and I'm proud to say that\nWe are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join a country come in and walk into a country which you don't belong to and not a citizen up then demand rights are you kidding me\nOh last year the question tonight is that the issue that's going to cause millions of Americans in two weeks in two days to vote for Democrats do you believe

I does this play well with residents of Connecticut because when I watch CNN or ABC News I'm thinking they're thinking this is playing horribly for Trump where I live in Ohio\nWe don't want ... will happily take one point one million every year more than the rest of the world put together as legal citizens who take the oath and go through the process we don't want hordes of illegals coming ... most violent places on earth we don't want that is this playing well in Connecticut\nAnd Connecticut there's so many people fleeing the state because of the high taxes I think the typical person in
