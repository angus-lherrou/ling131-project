situation on the southern border uh I think that one would probably go too far even for Trump's though that's my sense of a thank you so much right in my front made dean rides I but I Know I Know he was kidding I Know who's getting I just I didn't want to step on them and thought process seas so I moved\nTo the next roll call Maria\nRight does it make you wonder where all the anti gun folks are after the synagogue shooting they usually don't miss an opportunity to spin that narrative while Maria they are already out\nSpinning a narrative perhaps not quite as clearly as they have or as a and full throated a fashion that they have in the past I think that's mostly because\nThe anti gun anti Second Amendment left knows\nEnough to know that right now there are Democrats who are in some tight races in states where a gun rights are very much a supported by folks who vote and so they don't want to create more problems the Democratic party right now that's the only reason I think\nYou are honestly not seeing more shrill\nAh anti gun commentary in the media while you're not seeing more people running around protesting and all that kinda stuff ... right I'm a proud member of team bus Israel thanks for unwavering support for Jewish people everywhere feeling the love ... love is real so I'm Glad you're feeling it\nThank you very much for writing in from teen book Israel and please spread the word to your Israeli brothers and sisters that we would love to have more and more of them listening on the podcast joining in on the freedom which\nAh aries my buddy Wright's book this weekend the leftist media including fake tapper have proven their either agenda driven subversive bent on tearing the country apart for their own purposes or completely stupid and insane\nThere is no simple misunderstanding of difference of opinion on this point\nBy calling Trump's nationalistic rhetoric anti Semitic they're literally feeding into and agreeing with the talking points of anti Semitic groups\nLike the Nazis the nation of Islam and ... who say Jews cannot be loyal to their country et cetera et cetera uh yeah the media has been horrific on this aries and a top or has embarrassed\nHimself insofar as he spent so much time creating this oh I'm such a serious newsman brand I have no bias or allegiance he's a nasty snide little\nFellow and does a lot of stuff in public that is meant for public consumption but I can tell you that are behind the scenes not a nice guy not a good guy and that's all you really need to know\nA and has made a joke of his whole show I mean he had somebody on saying that ISIS has not radicalize as many people as Trump and let it go didn't immediately say well well you can't say that on here\nSo that's all you really need to know about somebody spokesman John\n... book I've been following all the quote justified violence from the left I Know how to beat it\nAh the anti ... and be all end folks are just paid thugs they don't really want to fight they just won't Republicans to fight back to defend themselves\nSo the left can point the finger at the right and say see they're they're violent fascist they're willing to be bloody than be not for it the real way to beat this has to follow the money why can't people with the right skill sets infiltrate these groups at a high level and expose the leaders and expose the money\nAh John following the money is very important that's why we had our friends rocking cut some on yesterday to talk about who is trying to fund these are the fund the caravan organizes the caravan\nThere are definitely people were going to I think they are definitely people that are putting money into this just a question of finding out who they are so I agree you got to find the money and we're certainly looking into it\nWilly ride seems like everybody forgot how the media were searching for a Tea Party member\nCalled James Holmes after the Colorado shooting asked Willie I remember that there have been efforts to try and tie the Tea Party to violence and they were unsuccessful because the Tea Party was a remarkably not just non violent but peaceful and entirely law abiding\nMovement and I think that that doesn't get talked about enough for obvious reasons media doesn't want to discuss\nHow well behaved and how civic or how much civic responsibility there was in the Tea Party movement\nUm shoes and rides you're so right on the TST I've got the real thing and I'll trade might be GST in for election loss trauma any day\nBecause it is not really a but not really because ... is your mind protecting itself it's a coping skills Susan I'm yes Jews and the fact that liberals are running around saying they think they have\nThe DSD because Trump won the election tells you a lot about the fact that they do need a safe spaces\nVowed Denise writes\nVote Shay s\nA pot or ... or\nAh I Do not speak Espanol bubble needs just so I have no idea I assume it means something to converse

Joanne rights would you address the issue\nOf unvaccinated individuals' come to the U.S in entering school systems all over the country well Joanne this is a concern a real one but people get very tense about it because whenever you talk about migrants and disease they say that that's inherently racist you're saying migrants are dirty and unclean at all this\nThat's not what anyone should say or or is saying who's reasonable on this issue but there are concerns about vaccination\nA lack of vaccination of some of these Margaret populations\nAnd there have been diseases that have been propping up popping up across the country that were thought to have been eradicated not in large numbers but it is something to think about and they don't want to have this discussion and the people that want to get the CDC more involved want the facts out there and there are a lot of\nImmigration activists on the left who don't care\nAnd think that this is either a law which it is not there are people who are going to be having different levels of vaccination that that come into the country as part of these caravans of and also just want to shut the whole thing down even if it is in July

Ninety day exercises um by Jesuit priest and a fourteen year old boy who prefer signed a pseudonym rolling do the extra system happened in Nineteen forty nine I roll into his boyhood home was in Prince George's County Maryland\nWhere this report in possession began and uh it went for Ninety Days three months I started in the winter\nAnd then in the spring of Nineteen forty nine ah ruins parents relocated from Maryland to a relative someone St Louis where over the course of two weeks there in St Louis there was there were nine ... participated in the boys' actresses ... one of them was father even bishop\nA he kept a diary of encounters there were a number of others who were involved that uh\nUh certainly uh you know\nThey're all getting up in age some of them have passed away I think\nAnd of course uh we were approached by a a number of people to ah discuss ah this case because apparently\nOne of the nurses that uh was there are witnessing the situation was actually told they took a sixty year vow of silence that we're going to talk about the case\nAnd now those who are survivors are are now talking about the case and one man in particular a Mark Perry\nIs an RN with forty two years in the medical field including over Thirty years and I use in the yards he's a U.S army veteran and a medic during the Nineteen seventies she was a Catholic brother of or or monk or with the election brothers for four years working on a working with the sisters of a crime to it\nAnd he sat down with John Grinder who was one of the nurses and it was there during the night of the extra system and he uh recorded a a a video that we have a and this is interesting we have exclusive rights to the radio and it's basically\nJohn Grinder giving up to six to your boss sounds about what happened that night\nUh in Nineteen forty nine with rolling do a mark welcome to ground zero\nAll oh welcome to the show it's good to have you here\nBut um yeah I called up he was talking about a ... or ... I think you saw ... while the ... a a little video that I talk with John I'm\nSee what I was talking about you know that that stuff just scares me [laughter] [laughter] oh he he\nUh I I was ... I watch the video today I took out some extra over too so we play them on the air with your fantastic interview with this man or how did you finally get a John to come forward a especially with all the ... those involved to you about silent\nWell the way the way it was a the election brothers have a hospital where they there are a congregation that started the in the seventh century\nAnd then it became an ... an official a congregation in the thirteenth fifties these days with a group of nursing a group of men who are where they lived on the outside\nIn the walls of cities in Europe and they\nBasically are where nurses to the people the court that were not allowed in the city so after the after the black plague\nThe you know they they were allowed in well in in the late Eighteen hundreds I'm a group of these men actually admitted it came from Europe\nTo America and settled in Chicago [noise] um they soon in the late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds at at a hospital they they started in I'm In\nSt Louis and this is the hospital where in in Nineteen forty nine Nineteen fifty the actress place [noise] so uh brother John Grider at the time was she was a an Eighteen year old nurse I'm\nTwenty year old nurse and a um a we also a month at the time and he was involved with the the actress and so in two thousand eight\nUm I was just sharing weather to be a\nA mug whether it'd be an election brother and a during that time I met brother John Grider and always given permission since he was the\nUh I was a nurse and and so is he so he you know talk very uplifting and um because he was the last brother that was alive\nUm who is at the actress it and I was given permission 'em by the you know\nPowers that be to to interview him so I did I um I just had this little camera I had to put it to the side because it was very nervous she only get they ... out so you know fifty\nFifty eight year about silent said he was he was eighty nine Ninety cents than he is he died and really now there's nobody left alive\nThat was um there at the extra so so what you see is the only first hand experience um\nAnd you know I I've I've tried when I was working in Las Vegas about a mile off the strip ... that I met a amateur pitcher who tried it come out and and the little stuffed in on it with this um [noise] with this video that I had and\nUh the day before he came out some very strange things happen to kill it buddy I ended up with a new month or acts and we just did a show and I've heard of other stories when stuff starts happening\nThere was actually a there was a priest who was supposed to go on the show tonight or his name was father long ago and uh he had confirmed being a part of the show and then he said that he decided to back out because he was worried about these strange things you're talking you're speaking of\nWell I yeah I uh that brother he was a monkey in the market is brother Warren long ago um and he has basically um he's the keeper of all of the books and everything and they were carrying down the hospital and um and they're already Nineteen seventies\nUm they they found the um the so a lot of the papers that they were put in the archives\nUp for the election bothers which is different archives and then what they had for the Jesuits at the time and a brother or a long ago with the keeper of that and um\nYeah I called him today to see if he if he would come on and it's like he just he doesn't want he didn't want to get involved with that at all\nWell and and I mean I'm sure you know and and like with the interview you did with brother Grider\nAre you noticing him and his mannerisms he was talking about it at first you could see him shaking\nA it appeared that he was terrified that he had to you know he was reiterating the store I think you handled it quite well in the interview actually because\nYou know for some reason you have this uncanny knack for getting the ... you actually when I get from it is that when when I was watching the interview while he was you know drifting off into other stories you kept him on task\nOf of talking and I and I basically highlighted are you in the exercise taken out of the show tonight I basically of highlighted some of the things that he kept reiterated some of the things that he saw some things that he uh obviously was so blown away by some of the things he did the but a lot of things that he said the other brothers and the other uh\nUh the other ... would solve that night and uh he\nEven mentioned I think a little bit about uh [noise] you know the analysts were shell a story with the Franciscan a Franciscans who said that the excesses ah you know in several movies you know you get to see The Exorcist movie\nFreezes it was pretty authentic he said that from what I heard he was pretty authentic we're going to get to that interview coming up Mike Mark Perry with his ground zero\nI'm ... many of the ... brothers who are still around who you know we're able

you would at a\nJob that was that that will be in our next February ... famous I thought that\nWas kind of I could do to create the kid would always go out like what are your what\nDirector and he said he had to tell him to shut up over and over again because the drill bit nuts but only could ever have you with Barry watched over midnight and then when he was going through is a moment just speaking Latin he ... he would swear in Latin and\nMaybe would laugh like would would\nGo over to before\nSo the interesting thing where several of the brothers were so affected that that\nThey left
