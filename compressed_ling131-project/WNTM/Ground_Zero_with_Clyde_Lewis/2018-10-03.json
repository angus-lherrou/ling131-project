{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "And I'm dismayed to realize that Kavanaugh is a bullying manipulator centers asked him many straightforward questions they needed a yes or no and he threw out red herrings without responded to the question he came back with and what about you include respond to questions not ask nor the ones that were asked frequently attacking the questioner\nWhen asked about his drinking behavior in school he spoke indignant about going to church getting good grades and volunteering at soup kitchens\nI unfortunately haven't well school this communication style by nurses just acts the behavior of all these types of participants was appalling but unfortunately rather familiar\nUm and a bunch of privilege prep school kids with way too much money and freedom and no supervision I saw some of that when I was in school and is anyone remember Animal House that movie made its mark because it was real this was not a fantasy about space aliens\nUm those yearbook entries tell the tale beach week Ralph club a hundred and ... run off the alumnus and the most telling devil's triangle which basically describes him as sports as happened with the two boys\nHe dismissed them all with Lindsay explanations that would never succeed during questioning by any parent or principal or dean doesn't he realized that many of us were there and it's counter shows use a two or three people are like I got I got to tell you\nI'm I I just disagree with everything you're saying Sally and and I say that with respect I think that you are\nI Can't say misinterpreting but I think that you are not properly contextualize ing how a person like Kavanaugh would feel under the circumstances\nI think that you're taking a lot of your outside observations about as you say preppy spoiled kids and and trend supposing that onto a man when it doesn't matter if other people have done terrible things when they're in prep school\nIt doesn't matter a fraternity brothers are off in a in coherently drunk and there's far too much sexual misconduct among them none of that actually matters\nWhen you're looking at the innocent or guilty of an individual did cabin on do this thing is there evidence to believe he did this thing I answer those questions no\nAnd no and I also think that your your being far too kind to Dr Ford's very selective memory and her recall is such that she cannot be challenged on anything and she's only certain that Kavanaugh's the bad guy\nI find that a little too convenient I don't believe it I don't believe that her memory\nIs accurate maybe she believes that this happened to her but I Do not think that her recollection of events\nSquares with reality that said Sally I Do like when people write in who disagree I Do like when people want to try to either convince me of their side or just have a different voice heard so don't feel like I'm In any way trying to shut you down or shout you down I I just have to tell you I I strongly disagree with your entire\nPremise on all of this um or I should say I disagree with your analysis on all of this ...\nAh with the new FBI investigation look into the will the new FBI investigation look into the new accusers background where we learn is lousy for\nFor how to substance abuse problem or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or borderline personality\nWhere we learn what she was like in high school and college or if she ever complain of any other instance of sexual assault or having been molested aren't these things that we should note to assess the reliability of her memories from thirty six\nYears ago max let me tell you uh I I agree in the sense that you your question here is why is it that we don't get any answers about lousy for why is it that lousy Ford\nIs a sacrosanct she cannot be cross examined she cannot be challenged her sexual history when she was ah in high school or sexual history in college or as an adult beyond that none of that can be discussed ... meanwhile Kavanaugh can be trashed why is that\nBecause he's accused I'm Sorry but we have a system of justice that relies upon oppositional narratives\nAnd it's not just you get the first crack at somebody and then they don't get to come back and tell their side of the story or this is fundamental to our justice system we are letting it'd be abused in front of us right now because there are so many people\nThat just want to believe lousy for desperately want to believe and for reasons of politics for reasons of their own emotional attachment\nTo the notion of sexual abuse is something that has not taken seriously I reject that by the way I think the sexual abuse has taken very seriously\nThere's a reason that sexual abuse in\nMany different ... you know many different iterations is a very serious felonies people go to prison for a long time so I I reject this narrative of sexual abuse is not taken seriously which a lot of people seem to want to believe\nUh Jennifer I'd say their pocket cash listener here first thank you for being a voice of sanity and reason and being hilarious at the same time quick question maybe you can help me with this\nIn terms of the lie detector tests what I've seen release was documentation of missed for being asked two questions by the administrator in regards to the statement she wrote but she testified June invasive an arduous process that was longer than she expected\nShe told her whole life story being asked a lot of questions and crying a lot which is it as a person who has had to observe lie detector tests being administered I've never seen a ... question test they're similar to her description under oath long did I miss something and this new cycle as possible know Jennifer I don't think you miss anything I think the two questions test\nSeems suspect me all along and I think that the whole polygraph in a way that they\nHave been trying to hold this off as the biggest piece of objective evidence they have I think that it's a I I think it's a scam quite honestly I think the polygraphs aren't used in court for good reason and I think that we should all be very clear that what's going on here\nIs all coordinated if you didn't want if she didn't want to come forward\nWhy don't you take a polygraph no one's ever given me a satisfactory answer answer that question no one\nRaymond ... unrelated to current political happenings\nI've heard you speak briefly on investments and some stands for research related information could you briefly speak your opinion on real

[laughter] I don't do that but anyway uh he asked me what I thought was going to be the the final blow a bit and I hate it\nDo you put on the spot like this because you know I'll say something and immediately apply Lewis said there's at least so full of crap you know I I you know sure you know you can make\nPrognostications in prophecies and you can predict stuff in the weatherman does it every day but no one says he's a liar you know and ... and if he messes up no one says he's a liar well it's like what I Do is kind of like being a weatherman\nI feel around in a in a look around and I see what the atmosphere is I'm Wondering what's going on and and ah so I made my determination so Jones a PIN me and he said hey so tell me what this final blows give me what do you think it is and I said it's going to be a biological attack on the United states\nMeals I agree I agree he's has um and uh I think I've been going on his show again soon probably this will be a good follow up for that you know when you're talking about this ah but yeah I told\nHim that I felt it would be a biological attack on the United states I speculate on many different occasions\nThat this will be carried out because I started off talking about ... acts in may\nI talked about the the tabletop exercise of a pandemic\nSo there there are preparing for some biological attack some\nContamination some toxic release um I talked to her again and function exercise is something that most people don't know about it and bring it to the forefront of talked about how sometimes in order to do a test run they they take a lesson ... form of something and they released into the public\nIs test to see you know how people react to it sometimes they provide them with the antidote sometimes they see how many people checking off spittle how many people stay home how many people bring it to work that you know it's just the way for\nA the CDC and others to to to monitor the moving the disease and some people do support this and a lot of people say it's not good to do this but they do it anyway\nUm\nApparently this new t._v. show about doctors called New Amsterdam\nOr apparently that was a ... that's a show that's on TV Now and somebody had said that it deals with a guy who gets a bowler Andy brings into the United states on a plane\nAnd of course we talked about the arrow plague we talked about you know the situation that happened\nAh with the uh Emirates plane for other planes where uh you know there was a different diseases monkey pox and uh gosh all kinds of things are happening and ah it's all happening at once and they said this is a is is again of these again a force exercise\nAnd ah I said you know something is going to happen where are the real thing is going to go down and when it does you know we'll know that this the beginning this is the beginning of the final\nBlow that\nAnd so I actually well and it could have been ... through the camp trails that could be you know given through mosquitoes and so today I read that the Pentagon reporter the envelopes containing biological poison rice and arrived at the Pentagon\nAnd the officer the president and senator Senator Ted Cruz's campaign office\nSo two packages containing rice in\nOr is intercepted by on the way to the Pentagon and the existence of the suspected packages was had been confirmed by the department of defense officials who indicated the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged in the mail delivery building on Monday\nBut in an ounce and they were here until Tuesday that was located next door to the defense department and right there is at its headquarters the FBI has been called in now\nTo lead the investigation ended up packages which we're addressing the secretary of defense James ... there was an address to James Mattis achiever naval operations admiral John Richardson and the president Ted Cruz's office the FBI released this statement\nThis is a statement from the ... on Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents took possession of too suspicious and below ups that had been screened at the Pentagon mail facility\nHe's envelopes are currently undergoing further testing and this is ongoing will have no further comment on this\nShow as Washington DC has been working to figure out if this you know this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz's office said they received a piece of mail it was addressed as Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is open to contain white powder\nAnd so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated after the fact that just found Pentagon also reports that rice and was detected and that ah and and so we're having a full on biological attack biological\nA poison rice and and just reminded me if you remember when I was talking about the project with a new American Century I said something to the fact that ah one of the other ways that they can change the direction of anything politically is to use biological warfare\nAnd even biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark\nA you know biological markers that would that would actually activate this stuff and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested or if it's injected\nHave you inhale it and so you can survive a inhaling a rice and it's just that you can die if you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now and so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four the Russian each called here in Oregon tried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote\nOr in Dallas, Oregon and uh\nI think here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way to a distract us from it\nAh there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time that that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night on the ground zero lounge they probably will have this investigation wrapped up by Wednesday they'll\nHand down their decision and the American people probably won't hear what the decision is and they don't have to the FBI doesn't have to reveal anything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and cabinet can be confirmed and I think it would trigger a lot of anger with a lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually becomes chief justice\nAnd so tomorrow it to Eighteen eastern time they're gonna be doing that test and emergency test on your telephone so as I said timing is everything just as peculiar\nAnd uh I think we should have a discussion about this because I think that uh you know as we were predicting it I predict it on our showing the show I talked about it at great length on this program for a good long time and people who is this program know\nLived on this people who let's this program know that if I'm On to something and I see the patterns these things go down and when they go down it's not necessarily to the exact you know 'cause I remember we talked about the pope stepping down when Ratzinger step down\nAnd we said oh you know he would probably lead retired die within three months he left the ... he left the papacy the one of my friends was really blown away by this but it was because we can see you know the talk we heard that we heard the Marines and rumors coming up from Rome\nAnd there are several other times in instances where we have a pretty much reported ... be prepared for the students happen or not always ripe or damn close believe it or not for damn close and so we're obviously seeing the beginnings of what would be the final blow if it's just out of hand\nSaid be prepared because if the word goes down tomorrow that cabin uh [noise] some people aren't pleased we can see some more civil unrest in some of the major cities across the country [noise]\nSo we have to prepare for that not that it will happen

invested in this those who are like harassing people like Mitch McConnell and others those are invested in this we need to be careful because you know anything can happen at this point\nIn with rice and being a delivered to you know the Pentagon some address to the president I don't understand why\nThis is not being investigated and and uh people aren't wondering if this was an attempt to assassinate the president\nOr in a in a more broader sense that'd be competition exercise because if they could send to all of the uh the people involved with the Kavanaugh for case you know packages of rice and if they could have killed at every single one of them or make them sick enough or too sick to vote because they said before\nA this is something that the Russian each called did back in Nineteen eighty four and this would be considered probably the second a biological attack or there would be a a domestic terrorist attack to actually for a vote or decision\nTripoli six seven three

interesting we're right before that that called them are that that takes tomorrow [noise]\nUm the the thing I keep thinking is is a couple of things is you know is it possible that is that anything is possible but is it possible that this could also be a distraction or I use that word by word but\nCould it be that actually the right side the right wing so to speak\nYeah could be putting this on as a distraction or whatever I'm too you know get some sympathy or whatever and then the other thing would be is um it's kind of interesting that the targeting of course Donald Trump you know he's the head of the right\nAnd then you have Ted Cruz which if you cruise Facebook\nYou know everybody seems to have Ted Cruz even though he's not really in the fall it anymore and the other interesting thing is is that Ted Cruz at one point wasn't he kind of\nA a guy that would have been considered to be a good a Supreme Court nominee so\nWell I don't know forgetting to bench a secretary of defense James Mattis was targeting also chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson was also targeted\n[noise] sure yeah I don't I don't know where their political affiliations wide but\nBut see that's the thing is that if this was I mean obviously this is politically motivated\nOr we don't know do it for what reason it was politically motivated I Would say it was to thwart the investigation and the vote the confirmation vote\nI think that would give them a reason to we're going to stop this right now and we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI is already made the decision and and I know they've already made the decision because um you know uh actually we were to ground zero allows discussing this and somebody said to me they said well\nThey're going to wrap this up by Wednesday they don't have to wait till friday they said well that week's time they don't have to wait all they have to do\nIs go back over some existing papers get all their ducks and rode dot the I's cross the T's come back give their decision the vote goes down he gets confirmed the American people were dumbfounded they don't know what's going on people who don't like the idea get angry and he started harassing people even more and maybe even worse than that\nAbsolutely and and the other thing is is it's just um\nIt's it's interesting that the whole I mean you know ... you are definitely you know obviously you try to stay out of the political game yeah and I\nAmerican Made an antique styled our Shapes Our part art part furniture

announced would income today because they were wanting to inspect all the mail to find out of rice and was involved they made the announcement the rice and was in the package is one of the of course\nSend to the president United States but what I find interesting is no reporting of is another major networks none in fact that they're focusing again on the ah there was again a cabin on board\nIn fact right now they're talking about the protesters I just talked about who we are confronting of course Mitch McConnell and others of course giving into faces I mean like they do it's like we're not getting into faces of the senators\nAnd basically blaming them and saying that the Republican Party is the party of rapist and and this is this is amazingly out of line in my opinion\nYeah it totally out of line\nSo I mean who knows if he was responsible for these rice it and who knows what the motive is but it just all sounds like it like I said the Nineteen eighty four tempted thwarting a boat\nOr changes says you're not a vote by the Russian each called in Oregon in Nineteen eighty four it's the same ammo if the same purpose to somehow stall or otherwise uh for the efforts of either the FBI investigation or the voting for senator cabinet\nYeah\nSo yes the timing of everything and I like I said there would be a biological attack there has been now we have this cat's do we have to deal with with the phones tomorrow to Eighteen eastern time I'd be fascinated to see if there's any other timing that goes with that too because that would be that would be even more

you when you call a program stick to topic it's going to fill in fact the hype fill up your own ground zero\nClad high up I just had a memory\nOut the story that they're still going on in in the summer of two thousand one right before nine eleven and a matter of fact that morning at nine eleven before the planes that tower\nHad hundred reporters standing outside a Democrat Senator name that guy ... ... and and the investigation on the mission is Shawn Levy remember\nThat yeah I remember that it it after the planes hit the towers\nAnd they lost like getting a function they your but after the towers that story was that was God I didn't hear about it\nOr have you been to say oh I Love you I mean she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right and uh yeah I mean that was a the hot news item into the the towers went down and then that everyone was like about after that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nWell I'm thinking this is comparable with Kevin for\nWell I I yeah I I but Gary wasn't planning on a ... ... being a chief justice [laughter]\nWhich I mean once again we have an extramarital affair story we have a a dead woman Chandra Levy\nA we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's the ... that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh I Would say that you know they're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people\nLost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case would Gary Cohn did that is if they were able to look through the dust cloud nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I just wanted to put that out there and I'll let you get\nGood very good point though very good comparison in history you get your brownie points for being a story about I think it ... and I loved it and you've been I Love you too man skilled at TJ in Rhode Island I don't either I\nMight be quick as much as I can be but you obviously ... what does two plus one plus eight at up to\nTwo plus one plus eight yep eleven\nThat's right and what does two plus there are a plus one plus eight at up to\nUm London\nOr try and when was nine what was what was that date back in September\nAnd then I had an eleven went into it when I was\nOne plus one add up to\nNine plus one plus one yep twelve\nNine oh what a loving sorry that's\nRight although nine eleven had the total eleven twenty Eighteen eleven you have this thing going on at two Eighteen as you said right\nWhich is an eleven eleven yeah and we just had a job or who was murdered in DC not too long ago\nRight Miller to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an eerie quality to it and\n... you want if you want to get technical when was the ground broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what day was that\nSeptember eleventh All right yeah\nI'm saying just one thing but I was calling up about the rice and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because if you recall back in terms of predicting programming\nWhat happened to the general in Venezuela where they accused him of staging his little assassination attempt with that drone ... might have tip their hand right they're letting you know in advance what was coming\nWell I mean you can see that there was something going on with these ah when I called these gain and function exercise I Believe the Emirates plane was part of that\nI Believe that when you have a group of people on the on the plane and they all complain of flu like symptoms all at once that's not a flu that something else and it does smack of of rice in poisoning\nAnd I'll just to be cleared Nineteen forty one nine eleven September eleven Nineteen forty one was in the Pentagon round was broken for the Pentagon then so I Know nine eleven to be a talked about two\nMen then remember overseas there's a lot of provocative behavior taking place upon the part of the United states where there were already threatening to strike a Russian missile or install installation because of start treaty violations and they're moving a shift to the ass off to\nSee a off of the Ukrainian coastline over there in Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the world\nRight and so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting them both how are they affect you invest though\nThe vote I Will tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down that's going to be a dramatic decision that will be the battle cry\nWill be confirmed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow you feel though if the FBI did not release the information about cabinet and his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I wouldn't be ripping but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're gonna already be finished by ...\nNow you have the ... not ... I'm Sorry to tell you it's not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when as far as news that I heard it already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just a value wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but now Mitch McConnell has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nDoesn't matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and that yeah well that's what I really don't\nCause you when you when you start playing with the very last word because it's not right because that's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's the last word not because it's right but because it is the last word once you start making something from politicized the political that nobody's going to have faith\nAnd or in in the integrity of that institution anymore\nWell I think we've lost faith Eighteen years ago you didn't really I Do I did and I have that's why I'm not political\nWell see that's why I don't understand your problem with people again being harassed you say by it I don't call that harassed and I think\nThat is around look if I if I get on an escalator and a woman says to me oh you turn your back on women is I treat women I look back at her and say no I'm On an escalator I'm getting away from you jumping all over me and yelling at me for something I have no control over\nBut they wouldn't be doing it to you because you're not a person who takes on the position of publicity and demanding attention\nAt it and then even then I had\nA great because I still consider it better than a presidential candidate who says to people beat the cream cheese out of somebody and I'll pay for\nYour legal you know one excuses Trump I don't excuse Trump for what he says\nIn fact he causes own problems on his own but when you have people that that basically a sumo things about you in public and yell at him out all over the place I get very angry about in fact I get mad when people assume things about me the run through and the reason why I\nStand on anything and you have I mean\nI I don't know why you don't have a matter of ...
