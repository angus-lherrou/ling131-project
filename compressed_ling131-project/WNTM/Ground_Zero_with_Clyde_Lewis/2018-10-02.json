the in the uh delivering so be of no shooting the declassified statements\nAnd we said well look barren hurt but hey everybody has them everybody has picked up on them and of course a lot to that said well and everybody knows that this nano particulate is actually connected\nTo more gallons and I'm a Brad Olson called the program who's a writer and he said he has had more gallons or has more

but I always have to see things\nIn a follow up senses I talked about the beginning of the program the blowback of course there's always blow back to some of this stuff but when you talk about in all blows back and you have to say well look this is this is how it is now\nBefore we were talking about if you were like God Matt and now it's like this is the real deal people smart cities uh they're
