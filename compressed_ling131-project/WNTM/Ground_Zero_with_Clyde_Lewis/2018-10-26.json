the whole thing along with all this we should bring in ten or twenty functional FEMA trailers\nThat can be used as temporary courtrooms that have all the judges already there to adjudicate any claims and all of for sanctuary status right there none of this come back we're three and three or four years for hearing bull crap I early on you know you're you're actually much more solution oriented than a lot of other people who think they are on this issue because\nThe problem is not that\nWe don't have enough people to catch people at the border from this caravan the problem is that they will turn themselves in and claim false asylum that's what they will do right so it's not decision oh we need more people to catch them I don't think I don't think everybody really really get that part of this\nYes they may be initially prosecuted for illegal entry if they don't show at a port of entry if they just try to cross the border but think about that the value proposition from their side\nIf you get close to the U.S Mexico border and you're a Honduran as part of this caravan you can either just try to sneak in the United states free and clear or if you get caught then you say oh well I'm claiming asylum\nDefensive asylum is what they call it I'm I'm I needed a song can you will still get process for the illegal entry but that's a misdemeanor and they're not going to deport you for that and so you've had your asylum hearing\nSo you really get two shots to stay in the U.S under the system as it is now and we do need much speedier process uh but keep in mind how do you even hear these psi leaves properly\nThey're not providing any ... any specific documentation of a threat against them they just tell a story and the question is is their story compelling\nSo but ... you're you're at least thinking about this and the right way which is that if we had a\nA a set up at the border where was essentially you know when they have the a producer Mike knows about this they got the uh courthouse under the the eagles the eagles play you know the football stadium they have a courthouse in the stadium for all the drunken brawl so their take you write down there and you know\nYou get justice dispensed right away you get your fine are you going to jail or whatever so it it sort of like that at the border would be what are what you can do so or when you're you're on the right track my friend Bryan\nWrites box still laughing out loud about trying to mediate discussion on the heated topic between crystal in Kansas we're actually well beyond time can just did an incredible\nJob holding her ground oh to be a fly on the wall pre and post that segment\nCanisters fears no there's no two ways about it I mean she you know you can come at her with with everything you've got and I'll tell you look crystal from the left is also very tenacious so it was quiet it I can tell a lot of you that does all this that it was quite a thing\nIt was quite a thing that ah that happens or by the way there's a rumor that junk weaker from the young church maybe there tomorrow and while I'm not planning to be in any way hum disrespect floor aggressive ah I have a feeling we will disagree profusely on some issues I have a feeling that could very well happen so\nWe will see a Josh\nBook I Want to thank you for writing my day after a long stressful day it's nice to listen in on the drive home you're accurate depiction of Hillary Clinton's cackle while you\nAfter ten years and he told his litter field I got out disillusioned in part because of Hillary Clinton

that she's doing because a personal loyalty an honor and friendship come before the debate for me you know what I mean that's that's just the way that it is and uh essays are a great lady and very very talented\nOr as to anyone telling it turned out my rhetoric oh no it was never see she she wouldn't do that uh it was other people it was actually a pretty prominent Anchorage he had a couple of pretty prominent anchors at CNN have told me to a reached out to me to tell me to tone it down and I\nI think to my credit refrain from pulling in Costa and reading back something profane in response which I definitely thought about but I ... I Try to one day folks I may let it slip with or not on this show obviously but it you know I may let it slip on Twitter or something\nSo one of the CNN anchors how I really think about them with some colorful language but I'll Try not to I just I Can't make any promises\nBut I'll Try I'll Try not to uh Jason writes buck buddy on Monday show you said it Stacey Abrams might win here in Georgia I'm telling you she don't stand a chance she's already maxed out the maximum for Democrats support in the state she's been line about voter suppression here's one she loses she has an excuse\nAs long as Republicans show up she's toast early voting is being led by the GOP Jason ... man I Hope you're right so I and I'm not a Georgia electoral expert or election expert I'm just you know just ...
