Fox News pastor Andrew Brunson who had been held under house arrest in Turkey for two years on terrorism charges now to US military base in Germany for medical exam after being freed earlier today suffered\nBut of course you'll buy several would the guy who actually got punched mouth\nA bunch of a job by Buzz Aldrin because each of the Bible in his face\nAnd he said that uh\nKnow she was ... I Want you swear on the Bible you walked on the moon and he wouldn't when he wouldn't do it should real goes well you're a liar that'd be a cheat and how dare you how can you ...\nSleep at night so ... ... but it was all just popped them in the in the jaw um so yeah I I mean people get all kind of had a big test if you tell them I have in doubt I doubt that we landed on the moon I mean you'd be skeptical about UFOs you'd be skeptical about everything else that many you start being skeptical about the moon landing\nIt's like you've kicked the pope somewhere in his body parts I think it's really a bad thing people don't like it\nWell I can tell you I still have my doubts about the moon landing and uh you know I have them even more now after what I've read today um you remember back in\nWhen was that it was a two thousand for President George W. Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon and twenty Fifteen and he said the NASA will test the new spacecraft was called the crew expiration vehicle by two thousand eight and ... the first manned mission no later than twenty fourteen\n\nWell here we are four years after the fact nothing we don't we don't have men men started back on the moon again we're we're just really talking about setting the first space tourists he's not even land on the moon is just going to go around the moon\nBut the President Bush had a goal set of having a man on the moon living and working there by twenty twenty having a base there and it's not out of the question I mean if you look of a Bigelow Aerospace is up to with making these inflatable moon basically I could have been done even a Mars based could've been done\nWell in two thousand nine we were told the NASA was carrying out this LCROSS experiment and they were lying to us about it about what they were using it for is that they were looking for ice on the moon but there are plenty of missions prior to the moon landing plenty of missions like the Clementine mission where they were scouting on the moon finding ice pockets\nAnd so they didn't need the LCROSS mission but ah of course NASA had five hundred million to spend on a rocket who's going to slam into the moon blow up and then a cause of created it's about six miles wide\nAnd you know people say oh my God they're gonna new moon and they were going to do this two days or two days shy of the ... anniversary of first landing on the moon\nAnd there was a lot of stuff about that mission that did all add up didn't make any sense\nAnd\nTwenty love and after the LCROSS mission failed bronco Obama cut funding for the proposed constellation program and the space vehicles\nHe he basically cancelled the five year nine billion dollar effort to build new Orion spacecraft and aries rockets the new space vehicles were slated to replace NASA's three aging space shuttles and launch astronauts into orbit and onto the moon that was the thing\nBut no Obama pulled the nine billion and they put the money towards data that that that climate change\nClimate science\nSo Obama kill the space program in order to turn now in the climate change police and that's that's really sad I mean if there was ever a time to doubt that we went to the moon at all that was the time because it you know they just shut down you know here we have this dream or going forward then Obama says\nNot not that we're not going to go so here we are in twenty Eighteen and we'd again been told that the moon is the goal and later Mars\nTo to the stories today that I Want to tell you about that really helped me excited but uh some bad news first of all a Russia seems to be out of their minds a parent late may have detected would appear to me to colliding stars\nAnd I think somewhere I have the sound of the stars I'll Try and dig it up but um yeah they detected the stars are putting off of sound gate of weird sound and are there going wait a minute\nOr these really colliding stars are we looking at a space armada coming our way\nAnd if they are moving assessed we think they're going to be here by twenty twenty two I'm getting I'm not kidding Russia found these colliding stars\nSoccer stars and they they've warned them out there saying well these are these look like cutting stars but the sounds are giving us she may have intelligence\nIn them so they may not be colliding stars at all what are they well they are um are there are no mater of of huge space craft coming our way\nUm\nNASA also reporting today that Seventeen scientists often report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national mission\n\nThe breathing was offered by the national academies of Science Engineering and medicine it emphasizes the importance including astrobiology the study of how life originated on earth and how it might evolve elsewhere in the University of every phase of all now submissions destined for space from inception conceptualization to planning to development and operation\nSo once again we have Seventeen scientists and guess what guys every mission that we do from now on is going to have the purpose of finding life out in space\n\nOnce again every mission is going to be about finding a life in space that have to have a a quest of finding life in space\nSays they picked up on to quote colliding stars that may be a space armada heading our way\n\nSo I Believe that the reason why this is happening why they're saying hey every mission has to have a fact finding like giving whatever is because they have confidence that there's intelligent life out there and the recent reports of techno signatures and fast ... actually it's fast radio burst\nOr the motivation behind the quest I don't know that it\nHas anything to do what he's claiming stars are possible are modest coming our way but it certainly has a lot to do with a techno signatures\nAnd get this astrophysicist are now saying\nThat with all the thousands of exoplanets out there and and how they're uncovering new insights into a complex the diversity of life on earth the authors also sit in a briefing that not only are you going to be looking for techno signatures guys we want you to look for bio signatures\n\nSo this is pretty amazing don't you think I mean I think it's cool I mean this bolsters the chance at life could exist out there\nAnd therefore all space exploration missions shooting corporate technology and find traces of alien organisms ... signatures take those things I mean look our president of the universe is more crammed with plants than ever before\nWe have two thousand three hundred confirmed exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission and that leads to efforts to six out of every ten stars could host Earth like planet so the sheer number of known exoplanets operas exciting opportunities for finding bio signatures fighting chemical markers indicating that yeah there's live out in space\nIn the report scientists recommended that NASA accelerate the development of technologies to detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument that can travel to a distant world and measure the composition of its elements minerals in organic matter\nReport also suggest that direct imaging systems that suppress star like should be used outside our solar system to improve the ... ... signatures from planets that might or but those stars NASA could also plan more missions that the peer under the surface of exoplanets\nWhether another rocked the icy or ocean worlds to find some training alien\nLife according to the report however [noise] ... neighbors either in our solar system are

L. S. rocket we've been working on guess why [laughter]\n[noise] not going to be ... not from hell knows how long I'll say about that coming up once again it makes you wonder if we really go to the moon

that's that's what I remember the story of all I can remember like in the Russian dog\n[noise] but I don't quite adult well the Russians set up a dog called black ah and like it was a dog they send up into space to see our dog react to go into space 'cause they were losing a lot of astronauts\nAspects were dying on the ... the old story about how there's probably some astronaut floating around in deep space somewhere to Russia announced that are causing the died\nOr what happened to be be sent my up into space and um Russia reported that uh the dog was doing okay you know dogs great out in space or being space\nOr they didn't tell us is is that when it went through the Van Allen died horrible death and a baby and announced that now for the longest time and and finally they be classified as I think it was like a couple of years ago that but like actually did a die oh maybe quite yeah\nQuite a good day it real quick in that in that presentation a lesson or all the money they they entered used several present day astronaut uh some of whom are involved with that new project I ended up super\nAdvanced space capsule yeah the guy that took Mitt battle Pettitte that Pettitte

said well\nIf we're ever going to go to the ... when we first must ensure that the electronics can survive\nThe Van Allen radiation field of course he asked for I mean they're talking about disclosure

happened before the testing but see a lot of people you know point to that\nIs that for Gus Grissom as the beginning of the conspiracy theory that we didn't go to the moon\nAmong Americans between Eighteen and twenty four years old twenty seven percent back in the Nineteen sixties expressed outfit NASA went to the moon over the years there have been many more people\nBut also stepped up and sit down and believe it then the moon I don't believe that we went to the moon I Believe that a Hollywood has been telling us all this time that we haven't Stanley Kubrick directed the moon landings two thousand one a space odyssey took time for their did the moon landing stuff\nAnd of course we were shown in Nineteen Seventy one diamonds Are Forever James Bond film is James Bond gets on a moon landing set\nNineteen Seventy eight Capricorn One movie the talks about men faking that the Mars landing spot or two thousand and one of Fox special conspiracy theory did we landed on the mood

famous earth shot and\nUh it's it's in his film if you want to look as funny thing happened to the moon it shows the astronaut speaking be the the famous blue earth shots\nSo you know there are plenty of things that can cast doubt plenty of things are getting cast doubt on whether or not the moon landing happen in two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon to Ryan program the ... the crew exploration vehicle\nBy two thousand eight you know we're supposed to be a working towards going to the moon getting there by twenty fourteen normally no later than twenty Fifteen didn't happen why because in two thousand nine actually it was a two thousand nine round two thousand nine rock Obama pulled the plug\nBut ah it it was because of a a a failed mission that we had to go to the moon within Al Cross a rocket\nBull crater the ministry of there was water which didn't make any sense because we already had survey ears and landers and and orbiters that mapped the moon Clementine actually mapped the moon in Nineteen Ninety four and a crime and China was able to deliver more than one point eight million digital images of the moon back to the ground\nAnd um\nThere was the interest satellite they were ground tracking the stations or that they were bad they enter L A ground tracking satellite station was picking up on these images so everything is accessible to the general public via the Internet\nAnd one scientist reviewed the data from Clementine they already found the existence of ice within the moon's creator so why did they did as well you know it was a failure nonetheless the LCROSS mission was a failure rock Obama pulled the funding from a vis a constellation Orion a project\nWhich kept us from going to the moon and a nine billion dollars is cut from the program and uh it slows down now here we are and twenty team\nWe've been told that the moon is the goal again and what's really cool\nIs it today it was reported that Seventeen scientists often to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national NASA mission there the briefing was authored by National Academy of Sciences engineering in medicine it says it says in the briefing and says that ah\nIt's very important\nThat the new NASA missions include a studies at astrobiology\nStudies of how life originated on earth and how it might have evolved elsewhere in the universe and every phase of all NASA admissions\nDestined for space from inception conceptualization they have to plan on trying to find a way to discover life in space\nAnd I think ... it's obvious the reason why they're saying is is because yes they have confidence that they found these techno signatures they found the ... waves are in fact Russian scientists ought to colliding starts thinking it was armada I played the tones of the stars coming out of Senate soft alarms all over the country so I won't be doing that again\nBut um\nAnd in fact this awful arms of shutdown radio station so if I had that Arabs because of that\nAh but in recent years we in the show has been discussing\nThat thousands of exoplanets and biologists were actually uncovering new insights to the complexity diversity of life on earth and and also a means discoveries would bolster and and we
