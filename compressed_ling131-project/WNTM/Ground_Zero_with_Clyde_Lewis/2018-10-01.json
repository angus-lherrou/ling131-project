I. she sat her so she has two front doors you know anybody that has to quit\nI don't know there's no snow\nSo obviously she had an issue\nNow just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or just because she says Brett Kavanaugh rate there it maybe not but all the evidence that she's for that so far all start being out of it ends\nIn fact if you present innocent a quarter of all in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend labeling geyser\nWho would have no motivation to line or a light all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nNow all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the ... with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did now they'll get discount Marts judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christie Ford's so they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the presidency and twenty sixteen what's the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't have the November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court one of his name wasn't on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned critical Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know\nBecause ... ... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case that fell short of being an assault case [laughter] however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility or order a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to be the post let me tell you from\nIreland and Kevin lawyers from the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing song it talks about equal rights and gender equality will you know what\nI was treated not as a woman that as a mad at eight percent bringing bringing forward charges against another person\nSo I watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily how cold and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly us that we find out she was all over the world\nAnd also just the whole story so thank thank God for people thank God for Brett Kavanaugh and thank God for Lindsey Graham", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Mobile", "day": "01"}
