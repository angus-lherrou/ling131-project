E. X. cheat a and T a sex\nTown as in my last name is the lay person\nWho takes care of a a church and also can be the one who ... graves and collect money during the off it tore a so they have it do you see that John I'm a grave digger yo\nYo isn't that the name of it isn't it really is that a weight it was that was a wrestler right no it was a monster truck oh monster aren't book that's what I meant monster truck I knew that I knew that\nAnd I've been looking for the uh the drop to [laughter] whenever you tell the story I just want to play the drop but I Can't find it somewhere online for sure\nYep well there were there we go so uh that that is that is where Sexton comes from\nDon is next step here book great show great hair shields high with regard to Leslie stall on sixty minutes while discussing the family separation at the border isn't it interesting that she said the law was on the books drawing Obama but he didn't enforce it isn't\nThat an admission of guilt hey no numbers this time I'm Well Don I Would say that it's not an admission of guilt but yes it's been a mission that it was Obama administration policy to ignore parts of the law that Obama did not like\nI'm so yes that that is a thing that the Obama administration would do and it leads to lawlessness unless it is\nFor very specific reason and it's a it's John Ford true a resource and prosecutorial discretion justifications if it's just 'cause I don't like this thing so I'm not going to enforce this thing well that's not the way it's supposed to work\nBob\nWrites Google Play seems to be behind on posting your podcast thought you'd like to know I don't know John that happened were were beyond the puck I suppose this week\nThat seems strange to me to get that out sooner\nCagey writes buck thanks again for your great show Katie thank you for your great message now I Need some advice to help resolve the political dispute my dad and I are unexpectedly at odds in an upcoming state election in Mississippi\nWe're having a special election that is putting two Republicans against each other one is a Tea Party candidate who is skewing the truth to the point of lies and who perhaps has been involved and questionable a pub a publicity schemes\nThe other is an establishment centers former Democrat\nI'm not looking for an endorsement for either\nBut for your political philosophy given the option between a dirty Kennedy that aligns with you politically and a candidate you can trust devote more moderate leaving you prefer who do you choose thanks for your opinion Katie Katie a very very a thoughtful question from you thank you so much for reading and\nUm [noise] who ... you know\nSince I Do not know either the people in this specific Mississippi raised this is just a question of establishing maybe a a means of uh judging similar situations is is really about what is my benchmark do I want somebody who votes the way I Want acts the way I Want but doesn't vote the way I Want in a politician\nAnd I have to say that I've evolved on this issue of it\nI I think that ah principles are most important for you and your day to day life but principles and politicians can be very hard to come by and to have a ... a politician who holds principles but no power is pretty useless\nSo I Would tend to say in the current political climate\nWhere centrism is really not a thing there's no spirit a bipartisan a pipe bipartisanship whatsoever there's no effort you meet in the middle of image look what happened with justice capital I think you've got to do for whoever can deliver the policy wins that's my honest assessment now\nThat varies I mean there's there's people that are shady and there's people who are who are grotesque and and deeply corrupt and it's not the same thing uh but yeah I Would I Would take a trustworthy\nOn policy but shady personally conservative or Republican or Tea Party or whatever over\nA upstanding but legislatively on palatable Democrat\nI suspect Robin writes yesterday you stated you wonder if the press is delusional or just not that smart it is both it's a time where introspection is essentially a profession for over sensitive snowflakes\nAre they are completely ignorant of a lengthy which they distort truth to make their agenda seem plausible there are so ignorant they can't see their own delusions and so delusional they can't see their own ignorance it's psychosis which requires a diagnosis hey look it rhymes\nI think Trump delusion disorder had gone further and become liberal or progressive delusion disorder there is no area in which they can see truth\nHuh Interesting\nThank you so much for writing and yeah I Do think that there's a a mass hysteria and really a mess psychosis those overtaken the left Michael writes a high bucks in short shouting regarding Elizabeth Warren here's some phone nicknames a liar walk the fraud resume or\nThey could do we are I guess instead of ... we're out of course Pocahontas and Pocahontas Michael well Michael you are certainly a creative fellow appreciate you writing in sat next up\nHere he says I have no idea why no one has said the possible murder and Turkey's Islamic problem with my three combat tours in the middle east as an infant treatment I never saw stories of babies rounded ovens dead families to include journalists make them shut up\nPlease I was on the ... is turkey is as long as problem ... um yeah I you know ... you're not hearing any criticism of Islam you're only hearing criticism of Saudi Arabia in this whole uh this whole murder and that's not by accident\nThe left is very quick to criticize religion that is not Islam but it's very fond of\nDefending Islam at every turn even even radical and and more extreme interpretations of Islam\nWhich is really where the problem was so there you go a journal and writes the where do you hear the news talk about the reporter at first I thought it was one of ours\nThis is not our issue not our citizens not our our territory I feel like this wouldn't have been so big an issue with Trump hadn't just succeeded in getting our pastor back half a draw attention away from that is something we have no control over I really do just like the media they make my head hurt well Gen I agree with you\nThanks everybody for writing in on that one I appreciate hearing from you as always big good show

I Believe that night okay my memory is is kinda faulty right now\nOkay so so okay so\nThe whole Russia Russia Today I went to look for the notes and nothing nothing so something weird happened last night too and this is this is a this is from a read a page right a\nIs reporting that there was a full worldwide shut down the YouTube last night there was because we were having a hard time preparing our show that gives a lot of that stuff we use for a month\nI was in for a music in liners and stuff we get from you too All right we get the audio from you too we couldn't get audio last night for a lot of things because you to shut had been shutdown full worldwide shut down on YouTube\nAnd there are rumors flying around as to why this outage happened and one of the chief rumors is and I'll read it directly from a from this this is from\n\nRead it okay if anyone has the footage of the man in uniform warning of an impact on the moon last night before you to shut down and took it off please share\nSo the rumor is that YouTube\nHad to shut down a viral video of a man in uniform there was pointing out that the moon was about to be struck by something\nOr he didn't say what it was he didn't have ... ... people say they thought it was like it had a hundreds of thousands of hits and then it was taken down and then all of a sudden you to shut down\nOkay\nSo that's a mystery that's tacked onto this you know I was notified\nBy an email\nA guy named Scott who told me I got to go back and see and to my email or Scott told me he says have you seen this video he was mentioning the video he sent it to me like five six teen\nOkay okay\nAll right so he said have you seen this video and and I didn't know what he was talking about All right\nSo you to shut down to the moon get hit by an asteroid or was it as\nA cyber attack here's another Youtube video saying was shut down because of this whole moon thing\nOkay\nSo I mean I'm getting now I'm getting bombarded with emails and all kinds of other pointers and and and references to what happened last night with you to shut down\nUh [noise] so\nThat's something that's mysterious something had crashed on the moon and they didn't want anybody you see it hit the moon so they shut down YouTube to keep people from watching it 'cause it was going viral\n[noise] now\nIt's like I said that sounded like a lot of science fiction disinformation right and and the fact that you can go back and reference things but I Do know when I talked about two nights ago I Do know I played those homes I Do know that I played a frequency and it was being sent by the so called armada\nAnd\nThis armada apparently that sounds coming from is shut down the radio stations across the country now YouTube shuts down okay it's back up again today but all this reminded me of an old science fiction film called earth versus the flying saucers and what happens in that film\nIs that rockets and missiles and satellites all get shut down because the aliens are planning to arrive they're planning of land\nAnd so I got to thinking about what's been happening in the past few days first of all the Russian rockets so use them as they can\nFeel the launch on its way to the I. S. S. according to a statement that was released by NASA the so use that as ten spacecraft launched from about can or cause of drumming Kazakhstan to the international space station for forty ... am eastern daylight time Thursday October eleven\nOr carrying American astronaut Nick Kagan Russian cause not alec C O inch in\nShortly after launch there was an anomaly what the booster and the launch ascent was aborted resulting in a ballistic lending of the spacecraft\n\nLaunched appeared to be going smoothly but about Ninety seconds later NASA on his live stream reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation\nThe space agency tweeted the ballistic descended Bob the sharper angle of landing compared to normal the castle containing the abstract successfully separated from the rocket booster and parachute into the ground with the rescue teams were there to pick them up it's also interesting to know the two of NASA's important space telescopes when did the safe mode\nShutting down about sending information back but that ... X ray observatory when did the same boat and all that all the science operation is a few days after Hubble the Hubble Space\nTelescope shut down due to a gyroscope failure according to the agency ... a transition at the same boat was possibly triggered by an issue that also had something to do with this gyroscope component in charge of pointing and stabilizing the telescope however there are some investigators and those are into deep space conspiracy theory\nThey're saying that something is happening in space that NASA does not want us to see\nAnd and and just out of coincidence NASA's curiosity Mars rover hits temporarily halted science operations to there's been a glitch with that so that we can't see anything from Mars\n\nCan't see anything from Mars here's an overnight bulletin\nHasn't made national headlines yet but here we go NASA's planetary defense coordination ops are offices two year old a two year old the organization that NASA's it's NASA's planetary defense coordination office two years old it started with a budget\nIt started with a small budget and now it's gone to\nOvernight and they they spiked it to a hundred and fifty million dollar budget for this a planetary defense coordination office\n\nFirst of all there was Ninety million dollars I wouldn't know sixty million dollars I went from sixty million dollars to one hundred and fifty million dollars overnight and says you're amid growing concerns of humanity is utterly unprepared for the unlikely but still an ... an asteroid strike of calamitous proportions\nThe White House has also recently issued a new national near earth object prepared to strategy an action plan intended to energize a host of agencies who could contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster\nSo Ninety million more dollars I mean we have nothing to concern about why is it the shot up to a hundred and fifty dollars a hundred and fifty million dollars\nSecondly why issue a brand new plan that it's intended to energize the host of agencies who can contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster if there is no debt disaster looming for the foreseeable future something isn't right about all this something is definitely wrong here\nI mean it feels like a really scary me horror science fiction film it sounds like a war of the world scenario it sounds\nToo weird to be real but it is real it's happening\n\nI mean these these shutdowns I mean remember the sunspot observatory was shut down on September ... twenty eight team and then all this stuff is good chicken shut it got to remember all the other space observatory they shut down after the September ... shut down in New Mexico\n\nI mean these shutdowns remind me of what happens before an alien invasion well he's from a science fiction perspective I mean and I I don't want I don't want it to be about this but I guess it all depends how you look\nAt what is going on around you and everything around us is is is is it just it sparking a lot of anxiety I was feeling really bizarre all day to day a lot of tension in my neck a lot of uh I couldn't concentrate\n\nI couldn't concentrate something was up and then when I'm reading all of these posts saying did you see the video of the man in uniform stadium to the moon was about to be hit by something I said no it went all over the Internet\nQuite as what shut down into [noise]\nAnd I thought oh my God where the Shonda X ray telescopes shut down the humble shut down the rover on on a on Mars is shut down in ... was shut down a month ago [noise]\nWhat are they hiding from us [noise]\nAnd those Russians they said well look at this ... this was an armada of UFOs [noise]\nI played the signal [noise] it shut down the radio stations across the country but here's something else [noise]\nThere's another signal\nThis signals coming from Antarctica [noise] I'll tell you about that coming up on ground zero it's just another bizarre thing to add to live as our stories I'm already selling you AAA thinks that was three thirty seven hundred that's AAA thinks there three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis Ulysses ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nListen to news radio seven ten W.
