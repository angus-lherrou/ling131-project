tell people\nThat perhaps it's time to heal and choose our battles no one\nWill listen because there are vendettas to be settled and revenge is a dish that his best serve cold in America\n\nYou whenever I speak of civil war ... civil of people in America I often get told that it will never get that bad quiet and then I fear mongering for the sake of clicks or ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back to people\nThat is certainly cynics that are there in order to keep telling yourself in America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed\nAnd they're living through a civil war and South America can teach you what to expect and it it's a real experience that I talked about that in the first hour\n\nI mean I Want to make it clear that during the civil war in a modern days in a modern city modern city like when I ...\nI mean life was normal except for little things that would make you wonder if you would make it through the day or if you would be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine that the United states the civil war would be similar\nExcept that we have the Internet that's the difference say I mean the outbreak of a civil war in the United states wouldn't look all that different to the normal news cycle\nIt would regularly you know and that's the thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different than the normal news cycle and what they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean it begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\n\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city\nOr direct you to Congress or to the president\n\nI Know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but it's certainly sent the ball rolling\nBecause there was a political attack using rice and a poison that was aimed at certain people including the president the United states if they would have sent all that their members of Congress we would have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attacks happened in two thousand one after the nine eleven attacks see how we have the rights that attack that happened just before the cabinet vote\n\nWe talked about the Russian each colt an al ... tried to use biological warfare is a way to give people not to vote or to somehow change the direction political you have an area here in in Oregon I mean these are simple politically motivated attacks\nAnd these attacks are usually supposed to not only change directions politically but they're also there to generate copycat attacks\n\nAnd these can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash they're simply done in order to provoke a response to give the response was overwhelming and police department's going to keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\n\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent\nAnd the domino effect is in play military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable his will be your martial law scenario except it will either be the military working within already militarized police or the police working against the military\n\nThere also be restrained to start with how or if if if there is an insurgency there will be some re straight at first but then the insurgency military weapons martial law all these things can be applied to a situation I don't know if it'll go that far but it can be applied I mean there's\nA misconception that in a modern civil war there'll be two sides\n\nAnd the reason why we think this is because we live back in history and we all know that it was the union believes me into less slavery and the confederation really being more slavery but most people are thinking right now that if there was a civil war in the United states it would be two sided and that's it\nLike\nRepublican against Democrat conserve against liberal no it's not how it's going to be a stop when civil war will be in the United states if this happens no it's not modern civil war would have many so called sight seeing the\nDirty war South America there were several sides were fighting there were the parent is kind of nice to the radical threat of comics the communist coming east is the Nazis the Catholic Church the Jews sewn into the police the moderate stay in a plaza I can go down all the list of who are fighting against to\n\nThe age group would have their own band if terrorists carrying out executions abductions and torture\nOf course the government had access to the police they had access to corrupt cops had access to military and so of course the government utilize them whenever they could the church would utilize them as well\nYour poll by the way was part of that group\nFeeding America we didn't have a left wing group incite violence or insurgency that what sparked a response from black lives matter or me too but all eyes would be an anti ... because they're usually\nOnes that carry out all this stuff when this stuff hits the fan\nOver the weekend there was a vigil in Portland, Oregon for Patrick Kimmons there was a black man who\nWas shot by police afterwards members of anti five blocks streets directing traffic getting harassed drivers and other people the police looked on and allow the harassment to happen it was horrible\n\nAn elderly man who made the mistake of not following orders of anti pot what's called a racist at a Nazi among other things and there was chased down by an angry mob where they proceeded to use ... times and other weapons the damages vehicle\nThe police looked on\nThe driver says he was following two other cars that made the right hand turn instead of a left when one protester stepped in front of his car and the other surrounding the man was out numbered\nProbably scared and did not know what he did wrong the truth is he did nothing wrong\nAnd it could have wound up\nWith him being beaten shot once again the police looked on didn't do anything didn't intervene\n\nI had about three thousand dollars for the damage done to his car\n\nOnce again of a civil war breaks out there that are here or in the United states would not be two sides fighting\nWe could see\nIn the sides with hundreds of agendas yearning and fighting for independence\n\nTheir separatist groups that America's militia groups keeper storm front patriot prayer Proud Boys Christian sects Muslim groups all these guys could come together\nAnd feel the flames for civil war\nOthers are just the Kennedys could be criminal gangs I give us Thirteen black nationalist groups white nationalist sovereign citizens generally any

protests in my neighborhood downtown and ah\nAnti fought was there and they were directing traffic and people were\nTelling people were to go there are blocking traffic going where to go in and they wouldn't they were abusing them and the boys just sat there and let it happen\n\nYou know I Want to know why I Wonder I Wonder why you know people I mean if you look at some of the videos I had them on my Facebook page and I said to myself why does this happen in my community why is this happening in my town\n\nAnd I said you know be prepared for anything I wasn't prepared to see I mean for the
