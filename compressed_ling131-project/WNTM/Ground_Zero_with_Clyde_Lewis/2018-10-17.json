did\nGet a close up shop in the freedom to night gene excited to be with you every day this week every day\nEvery week pretty much\nWhat I got to take a day off but a a job tomorrow\nOne request tell one friend to download the bucks X and Joe Palca on a book [noise] and then\nDon't feel like you have to use one of these social media sites that you know is infected with all kinds of left wing bias or they have all this conversational health nonsense going on and they are constantly trying to find ways to kill the table toward the less\nCausing organisms are evolving too and this poses the question about whether or not treatments and pills that kill the ills originally are now killing you\nSlowly but surely he was like all biological systems so disease causing organisms that are victims evolved it happens that's how it is and we noticed is with the ah the change in the flue last year where the flu mutated into something you know like um pneumonia some ...\nAh\nWe look back at some of the medications that have been used by the public that have led to\nA lot of bad effects that Philip am I a situation in the Nineteen sixties I Believe was one of the perfect examples of a sedative ... it was anti ... medication medication pregnant women were taking in pregnant women who use the drug costs serious congenital Mao formations and their babies\nNow today they're still drugs that are on the shelves right now but when misused or when they're taking responsibly can cause accidents and you can get anything from the just of intolerance to dying and that's why they call it I after Jenike artifacts\nAnd physical dependence can happen with the chronic use of any drug including many prescription drugs you would have taken his instructed\nPhysical dependence in of itself does not constitute addiction but it often accompanies addiction and it stinks in many people cannot or discern the distinction it's difficult to discern\nParticularly prescribe pain medication switch the need for increasing do just dosages actually represents tolerance or worst thing underlying problem as opposed to the beginning of abuse or addiction I've always learned\nAs a general rule but if you're taking a pill to kill the pain you're dependent if you're taking a pill after the pain is gone you're addicted\nBut if you're taking your bills is directed in the paper says your body has gotten used to them overtime or the worst case scenario would be that the drug companies are doing the equivalent of watering down the alcohol and I've always talked about that as well be advocacy\nOf of a pain medications I Believe the yo yo wing of the doping mean is what is causing the opioid crisis and so what we're getting is adverse effects for getting opposite expectations of outcomes it becomes a no CBO effect\nSo called pandemic of opiate overuse may be seen as a as a no ... no no CBO effect itself tonight and I'm going to be the spoiler 'cause I don't really give a damn about the TV show it's called ah the Connors are used to be Roseanne\nOn ABC Roseanne it said that in the show they were going to kill her off there were a killer off the program I'm with an opioid overdose they did it they actually killed or off\nFrom an opioid overdose everybody said how does how do they know how do they know they're trying to cover up the fact that she's spoiled at for everybody weeks ago and I basically had said well if you're following the Roseanne program she was actually are in need of a knee surgery and the show\nAnd then she'd been taking pain pills from friends and others and having a stash around the house so it was a given\nThat it would kill her off by giving her an opioid overdose\nAnd see this is the thing that bothers me about the opioid the opioid problem and the opioid overdose in and out the opioid overdose scares that are giving everybody that is if you are addicted or if you overdose on pain medications it's a moral failing\nPeople have you believe it's a moral failing of propaganda have you believe that you're ... you're an addict\nWhen you're not\nAnd so the killing off of Roseanne with an opioid overdose in my opinion is exactly what they were expecting is exactly what was going to happen and uh and that's why it was done so tonight I wanted to bring on a friend of mine who live out on the shall we haven't had him on a long time\nBeen Fuchs and he's a registered pharmacist he's a nutritionist and cosmetic chemist and has been\nCompounding custom medication formulating nutritional and skin care products and consulting with doctors and patients

University of Colorado School of pharmacy in Nineteen eighty six distributions recognizes nationally for his work as the on air pharmacist nutritious host of the bright side radio program Ben Fuchs welcome to ground zero\nHey try to talk to you again love doing this show because you are so darn television Clyde thanks you [laughter] I ...\nI really appreciate it and so so band I mean what is it with a propaganda when the world today making people who are using pills for paying give it to get making them a treating them like moral a pariah I that's what they did when Roseanne denied they actually killed her off the TV show\nOr said she had opioid addiction and she died of an opioid overdose ... why are they\nOff her twice sex for you I answer a pool according to his father you know people are so silly it's just ridiculous how we had this idea\nThat uh we're okay to judge people or whatever their behaviors are OK to cast Persians on others or whatever their behavior is acting human body is hardwired to the substances as hard wired specially can be addictive substances that are already inherent in it and that's what opiates are\nThey are analogs bio chemicals that are already in your brain so when you have to say that you have to pay ... an opiate tell what all immediately happen is your ... your brain was down regulate\nThe production of its own in ... and you'll in Athens become decision by taking artificial opiates you'll end up in ... which will put you in a deficit state and there's a there's a pills in Iraq right and you almost impossible\nThis now I Know that I Know that we have a a sort of a psycho social context\nSurrounding the patient Dr relationship the patient foreign minister pharmacist relationship but yeah I I think people tend to ignore the fact that you know right now if you're using opiates you you become pretty much a ... you become a remark and NPR why we're what's that or\nYour award you're awarded the state yeah you belong state you belong to the medical model and that and they love that yeah well now what are you going to do you're hooked on August ... you you have to go to the doctor you have to go to the pharmacist even if it even if it means of Dr pharmacist shopping\nYou you're compelled to become to be a part of the model of paradigm once you get on a city that once you get on the drug ... shut illegal drugs too by the way that people get that's how dealers and and a drug drug dealers gets you hooked on heroin\nWell and that's the truth or you know one of the thing I did a show one time about crocodile and it was interesting because ah I was talking about it was cheap heroin and that many people that look very attractive to use this cheap heroin and uh I was saying\nYou know be aware of crooked deal because your kids may be using it and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd boy did I have an education I had people calling me all over the country in their sixties and seventies saying to me that they\nAddicted to heroin and that they are they're the ones that ... that the main worry about that that that uh they said you should be worried about grandma and grandpa\nOr have gotten their pain pills taken away from them\nAnd they have to resort to using heroin or they have to get heroin and they get like a really low dose of heroin but if they can make cheap crooked deal in their kitchen maybe more than happy to do that get rid of their pain and the stories I heard were heartbreaking stories of like a guy called me and said I was in a motorcycle crash\nAnd I was in a lot of pain and the doctors gave me my medication and one day they just decided we were going to give it to me anymore\nAnd so I had to use heroin\nAnd I'm going wow you do that and I never thought he was I always thought you know be where the kids taking drugs but no be where grandma and grandpa who aren't getting their pain medications because the doctors don't know how to treat the pain\nIt's a terrible situation it's just absolutely terrible situation as you our talking before a lot of it is based on the fact that we've created a society and we've created a culture that is conducive not not the physical damage the psychic pain to to ... pain and guess what opiates work on that too\nWell now now they want to bring back ... D for certain types of uh a depression so\nThe ATF the and mushrooms for people who are dying camp right\nI I I don't understand like I said the propaganda machines in the United states always seem to find a way to create a some sort of scenario propaganda feed for they're telling people for the certain drug you're using it's a moral failing so if you use this drug is a moral failure if you're addicted it's moral failing\nAnd this is why we get people turning to harder drugs has nothing to do with gateway drugs have everything to do with well I'm not getting the satisfaction both physically and ... so therefore I'm going to use my body until I reached that does that mean scored by that time to get too much of it you'd die remember called eight seven seven eight seven seven\nFour zero to ground zero for life dot com we'll be back\nThis is a Bloomberg market than it it was a turnaround Tuesday as the stock market rebounded the Dow Jones industrial rose five hundred forty eight points to point two percent twenty five thousand seven Ninety eight\nBut has closed two hundred Fifteen points are two point nine percent higher the S. and P. five hundred added fifty nine points or to point two percent\nIBM's third quarter profit top forecasts but revenue fell short big blue reported after the closing bell shares of dollar tree rose nearly ... percent after the New York post reported Carl Icahn has taken a stake in the discount trade\nWalmart projects that same store sales excluding fuel will increase two and a half to three percent and the next fiscal year\nThat would follow expect the growth of about three percent for this year which would be the giant retailers best showing since two thousand eight\nThe Labor Department reported the number of job openings hit another record high in August crude oil futures closed at Seventy one dollars and ... to ... a barrel ...

talking about fencing they own a pro football and all these other drugs and it'd be nice up there there's got to be a reason why they're making this push you\nKnow again and then I was reading some

it's just amazing they they sit there and they they opined that people are abusing these medications\nAnd yet they they uh they they release more\nInto the markets and\nI ... times stronger client\nI think it's five hundred times try to look into it I thought I was reading today although I I I'll have to look carefully the story to find out for sure I was going to ah bring it up but my notes and I and I neglected to I think I left them in the in the room I'll probably pick 'em up or something or have somebody go get them for me or what have you uh so we we could find out more about it but yeah that's a\nThat's a new drug they're really saying I Can't remember the day with some strange name uh but yeah it's it's it's another opiate they're going to push on the public but they say it has to
