now is Thomas ... former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about these situations weather's and attempted mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that uh this is Robert ... was just a wonderful guy\nThe NBC News this morning at on a neighbor lived next door to him a heavy set a woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that the same Thomas Russian former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas Redskin welcome again in the bill Cunningham shown Thomas are you\nGoing to be very tough situation awful um but when I watch\nSome of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd I hid menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kinda shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties\nHe had posted online for quite a while and I submitted ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was two uh two nights on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren Jewish and why he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless\nUh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible\nThe Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon it today did ugly reporting\nSaying that uh that in fact the Sarah Sanders put out something a few hours ago just said is there any tragedy the Washington Post went out exploit\nDo attack President Trump the evil active anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such an on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective ... said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nAre not as I've seen you know there's always twenty twenty\nIn the long course men or the investigative world when I Can't believe that no one else was monitoring his ... his social media is other things he was posting couldn't have alerted only\nWent one way you know when you say is if you see something say something\n[laughter] this case you know someone had this scene\nAnd could've alerted the police on the police you when you find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about ... hours and and do something or in a look to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him\nAnd we can criticize the police but until that time\nPolice and law enforcement agencies and even intelligence agencies don't have the manpower or the bandwidth\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting and Broward County there was a woman or call FBI numerous people had caught about an Eighteen year old up punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people call it in that wasn't following up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nThere's no protection on horse but you're only as good as she is today and wish I could take the law enforcement and it's very easy to do after seeing a law enforcement is tough on so I Know from my experience with the NYPD\nWe always look back we always did a review of what had happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with the case in the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back in figuring out what could we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure in Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a barrel said a posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics ongoing in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media\nSomebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating and I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there are several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ours wedding for a trigger moment\nThat social media exacerbates highlight these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\n... other like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against ah against Jews and against African Americans there were several hundred did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump\nHe he he'd previously wrote I never voted for Trump nor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\n... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so well when you were in NYPD or you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nYes I totally agree and take what you said even further this president has a son in law who is the orthodox and a very religious Jewish guy he has a daughter who converted to Judaism\nAnd as you said his grandchildren or Jewish so you know I I don't think it's a matter of\nYou know what is said it's a matter of how we're saying and it's a matter for law enforcement standpoint of it has to be held back because you're pressing police departments and agree right they have to be ready\nTo respond to a ... guy goes into Times Square but no one of the reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater in New York City on me [laughter] a bunch of years ago and thank God he failed terrorism school\nAnd couldn't blow up his own car because he would have killed if not injured hundreds if not thousands of people but there are not like this around the country it's what keeps law enforcement people up at night worrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talk to someone the guy who was\nSort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood who is capable of grabbing his guns\nAnd go into a place in killing innocent people for no other reason than his ideology or his private jeeze\nThomas is out there all the way but Thomas

Bill thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize and disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist\nIn Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\nWho has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many as Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a gang members deportees there's also a\nMan of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they tried to say oh this is you know people are just are coming along and doing it on their own\nMeals are suddenly appearing tents are suddenly appearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me\nWhy don't you take your wife and kids and try walking the Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the free hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs it a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election in your in my lifetime I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone at the Democratic party explain why here we are getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place at the same time with ... million marching together along with food and I'm an army marches on his belly along with water and ... all of these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will cover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate\nUh caravans that have formed the largest one that we are talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that has an even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of panning the crowd and showing the visual\nAnd I've seen a pictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies and so on\nThey are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift\nUh not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTwo or Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by left this government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city":
