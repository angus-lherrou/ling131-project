I mean we go all the way back before pre genesis\nOr well it's you know that it's your gas as good as mine 'cause you know it's the most amazing artifact in or what I Do with it mainly as use it because it is a tool for helping people especially right now that the world seems like it needs a lot of help and the skull is works and that very well\nSingle Ryan was saying he said we need to take these are symbols and we need to take away the warped\nValues an add value to them and use them to help with some guidance and a and to keep as a you know pretty much on track for what these ... I mean sure a lot of prophecy maybe dark a lot of problems you may not be good but there's always hope that as a lead with it as well am I correct\nOr I think the hope is the real thing\nAnd I think the ... the minds of them in\nA given hope and working for a positive future we can we can make major change in the ... and what's happening right now in the world and it's not like we're\nNot we're just one person or whatever we can work together on this and we can make big changes of the skull a you know when you some people see it they say they don't think of it as something positive because they have these thoughts and their mind about uh schools but when\nYou see that especially in the Mitchell heads just go and you see the workman ship and the love that went into it and the uh just there's a special energy that you you can you can feel the energy and it's a it's a really really neat so that's what we do\nYeah and every time I mean this is an amazing school this is the one\nThat ah I've always admired for its work would ship and how beautiful it is and the power it's certainly possesses incense through and the power in the room we have the night and what we're feeling\nIt's certainly a is inspiring a and and I guess for people who know nothing about the schools why is this crystal skull so important and why is president so important in the room tonight well\nIt's a considered one of the ancient skulls and like you say the skull stores knowledge for everything it's seen been around for all the years and so uh it's believed to be a receptor\nCola mind and\nIt's this reciprocal in mind has been programmed by the ancient masters with the knowledge of the universe so uh it's it's here and it comes through is very very a gentle but very powerful\nYeah certainly I'm sure it has a lot of things to tell us I'm sure it has a lot of the tonight we have a of course we have a lot of things a lot of uh I'd say uh\nYou know people who want to join into the program tonight we of Gerald Davis coming up tonight who we've found on the program before she's a medium\nUh also uh I guess a psychic can away she's\nShe's she is a person who communicates the skull\nAnd she'll be on the program tonight we have Stephanie Phelps who was just come on the program tonight and of course we have a with is also a we have a a ...\nVon ... he didn't even ... and that's it and and what is what is ... what does your death and he's written books about the crystal skull heavy not\nA he's he's one of the more experts on the crystal skulls he he works with them for a number of years you've written books he's a doctor and a a he has a lot to say about him I that's what I Would I think it'd be interesting to hear what he has to say ...\nOr ... or drop out let's go to let's go to job right now job you there is I mean yeah\nAnd it's good to have you on the program thank you for being on the program with us we're here with the bill and of course the crystal skull or tell us about your interest in how your interest began in this in this subject\nWell it'd be again a very emotional experience ... and ... but it was it Nineteen Ninety four I met ... well at least I didn't
