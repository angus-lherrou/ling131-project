ears open on this one and hope to get more facts more information more data upon which to base our analyses shoe Julianne right age\nThe way you hear the news talking about the reporter ... at first I thought it was one of ours there's just not our issue\nNot our citizen and not on our territory I feel like this wouldn't have been so big an issue of Trump had not just exceeding getting our pastor ... and not just succeeded in getting her past her back or why are these people not getting arrested\nGen do you mean the people the Saudi people that are because they were arrested or are we talking about the caravan I'm not clear right me again and let me know\n...\nBook my wife and I just returned from our annual trip to Albuquerque and for the international balloon fiesta and we always worked in a couple of days in El Paso well out there I like to watch a lot of local news whenever I'm Out of town and during the commercial breaks\nThere were obviously tons of political ads several which featured the highly touted Beto O'Rourke this was my first\nExperience at length with senator or ... or send your or send your O'Rourke sorry to send your or ... to say and I came with a thoroughly non plus\nHe's not all that photogenic he can speak incomplete sentences but the crappy throws out as truly style over substance he of course accused Republicans of a smear campaign against him with his DWI attempted escape and when he threw out it's not a Democrat or Republican thing I stopped worrying about him Obama\nConcern me two thousand for that speech at the DNC ... concerns me zero empty suit except he seems to issue shoots whenever possible Dale\nDale I I think that they are going to try to make a better way national figure I I think that they do\nBelieve that even though he couldn't win in Texas or they might think of him as a presidential contender because that's the only way the Democrats are believed that they can win was to run somebody who has a national level profile even if they don't have national level of political experience that's what I think\nI'm\nChad Wright's book love your stuff however you don't have the knowledge or experience to take on the vaccine topic either\nLearn more about both sides of the issue or just don't talk about it it's no elitist liberals who choose not to vaccinate many conservatives like my wife and I would over forty years in the health care field between us don't vaccinate our six kids\nIf you want to understand both sides and when the answer any questions you may have for many it's always an except the risk until it happens to their child good parents aren't the ones unwilling to look at both sides shield side shot OK chat\nUm I I don't pretend to have any knowledge about this other than just what I can read and what I can learn on my own I I have no professional experience in medicine or health at all I Do have access to a number of people in my personal and professional network\nWho I Believe would be considered world class MDs including somebody who is chief of infectious disease at one of the biggest and most well regarded hospitals in New York City\nAnd they can just tell you they have no time for the vaccines cause\nAutism discussion and debate they think that it's essentially like saying that the moon landing didn't happen they do not take it seriously at all as an intellectual position worthy of debate\nSo I I can pass that along the ... by the way they're conservatives so I mean that there are people that politically I I happen to agree with all of that doesn't matter for this discussion but they're not a liberal so caught up in some kind of a fad\nThey I've asked them about this a few of them\nAnd they're very definitive and I know people get very mad at me I'm just the messenger here man I have yet to meet a doctor in fact that would be my challenge you give me a well regarded or epidemiologist or a or MD with decades of experience\nAnd an incredibly a acclaimed record who will tell me that vaccines are dangerous and people should not get vaccinated\nAnd then I'm happy to take that on board as something that might sway me to one side of the argument the other\nI can just tell you chat I've never come across that and I've asked a lot of people about this and all I get our people to get mad at me and then they send me a link to a blog that has nothing other than just somebody posting other blog link articles\nAnd that's it so I I asked him when I when I talk about the global warming debate or climate change whatever they call it the other side says well there are no there are no well regarded scientists who disagree with us\nAnd I know that's alive because like a name well regarded scientists Richard lens in a you know that there are there are well regarded scientist on the record\nWho say that it is not true the climate change is the threat that we are led to believe\nI just wanted well regarded MD to tell me that is a an insight to studies or the research for it and then I'll take that on board I just people get mad at me for this I Know they're very passionate about the topic\nI Am never given any reference or research that serious I'm just giving people that say well look at Suzie so and so who talked to Bobby so and so who knows the guy who's like a really important researcher and says that vaccines cause autism two\nPeople can get mad at me all they want I just I'll change my opinion when I have some facts were some research that's all I don't know\nSo I appreciate your writing in shadow I'm Glad that you love my stuff and I hope you don't get mad at me for this response to you but I Am ... because I Know people get mad at me for this would including my own team\nI don't know what they want me to say give me some evidence and
