{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "Tone I Love it Chris you know of course I I just I I think that there's ... there's an adaptation going on in my thinking and it's maybe something I've been a little slower than some of my other colleagues on the right to adopt in some ways because I come from this perspective of\nWell this'll sound self aggrandizing but knowledge having a background in in the actual work that I Do especially in the national security side knowledge and facts and wisdom that's how I tried to approach what I Do and and so I always want to think that I could have\nLiberals listening to this show and I certainly hope to all the liberals who are listening that they still feel this way but I Want them know that I I Want to bring them over to my side a and I don't want to be too strident that has always been my approach but recently the left has gone insane and so I Am separating out in my mind\nI Want to say and saying I mean more insane than usual I separated in my mind how I speak to Democrats really in general from how I'm now speaking to the hardcore left because I Am an ideological war with the hardcore left a centrist Democrats\nI Want to come over to my side not necessarily even on everything but on whatever they're willing to put the hardcore left just must be ideologically smashed and and destroyed must be defeated you know the ... the ah the people that are running around with the pink hats on and that are saying due process doesn't count anymore\nOr and they they the ones who are doing deep platform ing and want people to be boycotted and to be fired from their jobs for\nExpressing that served her opinions we have to fight that ideology not not meet it in a gentleman the contest but we actually have to throw some elbows and that that maybe has been a a learning process for me in this Arab Trump because I've seen more and more of what the left\nAnd not just with the left is but how much of\nThe Democrat Party and how much of the ideological a center left they control\nAnd the hard left them in the progressive vanguard is way too prominent way too powerful and can and cannot be a just wished away any more so if I sound at all like I'm a little more strident or a little more uh fired up about things in the last few months it's really because\nI've seen this battle we're entering into is all about and this is political total war this is not a you know made the best man when this is one man will win and one man will not leave the octagon so to speak\nAnd in that kind of political environment you ... you have to be ready to to go ... and in a sense that's really what I've learned from Trump\nYou know there there have been some things\nThat Trump is Donald Trump is said and I thought oh my gosh that's such a mistake oh my gosh how could Trump if\nHave gone with that that's so that's so foolish of and that's so silly and then within a few and this happens less and less now because I realize we're dealing with with Trump uh and then time passes and I realized wait a second he was right not to apologize for that they would've just\nMould him like a like a ... I was going to say a flock of per on us but now I'm mixing things up a like a school of angry raging Peron has\nA ... they they would have torn apart if he had agreed to what they said he should agreed to about one statement you made or another better just stand and fight and constantly push back on these issues these things that I'm learning from Trump isn't just like all of you\nI have to adapt my approach and my thinking for the the current moment I have to actually think about what's working what's not working and I I reevaluate I'll say one of the most important lessons I've seen one of the biggest\nUh differentiate or when it comes to whether someone is successful or not is do they have the capacity for self correction\nOr do they have the ability to look at whatever they're doing in life how they're treating themselves how they're treating other people how they are doing their work or whatever how how they're taking care of their health and an objectively assess what is going right what is not what is going wrong are not going well\nMake changes and I'm constantly making changes I mean I have core principles and a and an approach and an east coast\nBut I'm counting making changes to what I think is going to to work best in this this ideological fight I mean that's really what I Do hear every day yes I like to present information and there's an aspect of this that's\nA really just about dare I say it's far from the left community right we're all a community here on the show um but there's also how can I quit\nThose listen to the show with the best arguments possible and equip them also with the knowledge that they are in fact correct in their beliefs either ... explain not just what we should all think about different issues but why we should think that way\nSo I think that's all very very important um and and yeah I I Am\nAlso in a process of of learning all the time I don't want to ever make it seem like I'm just the one guy who thinks that he's doing it the right way and it has never adjusting I'm adjusting all the time Brad writes dear book I just read that Hillary Clinton security clearance revoked at her request\nI was wondering what are your thoughts on this are and why in the world would she makes such a request especially if she's planning on running again in twenty twenty I'm a loyal podcasts listener and wanted to thank you for releasing your podcast earlier\nSo us folks up here in Alaska can listen to it on the way home ... thanks for keeping us in the know Brad a well Brett first of all I'm so glad you liked the pocket gases out sooner\nAnd I'm hoping that everybody in the west coast now is that we're pretty much now are pod cast is going up for this show for the buck sex and show\nIn drive time on the west coast so ... there's no problem with you deciding that you're going to just get a little bit ahead of the game and a and listening to it a little early ... you don't have to wait and wait for it to be rebroadcast her to be broadcast on whatever stations near you you can listen to it on the\nOn the podcast however you consume puck is\nUh and so that's great news you're listening up in Alaska that way and as for keeping everybody in the no I certainly try Hillary under security clearance\nLook let's just let's just call it where it is Hillary should never have been able to keep a security clearance after the debacle that occurred with her private email server private email account all that stuff and that was just\nCompletely it should've been terrifically embarrassing for anybody not just associated with Hillary Clinton but who was willing to defend that nonsense that she held to a new clearance until this point just goes to show you how broken the system is\nUndermined you all that to this Friday I Will be doing an event with my friends at stansberry research will be about what's coming next in the markets and big big things to tell you about I'll be joining them for a full [noise]\nLive event this Friday just go to book event dot com free to register folks totally free you can watch the whole thing register forward free all free\nBook events dot com and getting ...

whatever you want to call it would start breeding in America and you know I Know that people ... near the the very suggestion that the United states is starting to resemble some sort of a dystopian Ninety maybe for\nThose ski a position by demons type of thing um in fact I brought up\nYou just ask you a story or when I did my show the other night uh when I was talking about ah what was happening in Portland or we had over the weekend we had a the the the rival ah groups get together and fight in downtown Portland\nAnd so uh it was certainly you know under being the things that I had to stay out again and do work\nUh because of the fact that uh they needed someone to go wall to wall and I'm not complaining because I I Want to be in on the uh I Want to be in on the secrets I Want to know about the big things that are being planned I Want to know\n'em I Want to know who's involved and why and so I brought up this book called possess the devils it's a book that was written by a there was the ski\nAnd off it was pre revolutionary or if it were at the details that the middle class society would be destroyed through a crackdown on dissent\nThan islands expected to revolt in a way to the time where the people would rise to the occasion and give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain\n\nDenial is expected some sort of revolt so they awaited the time or the people would rise to the occasion\nAnd give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain basically giving this power structure heartening to resolve the power structure to literally come in and clean house\nYou know I began and does the U.S his book and began with the silencing of the people the silencing of those people who are putting forth to the fired state power that happened\nYou know they went and they shut down\nThey shut down the you know the printing presses they shut down or you know journalists silencing people their free speech the freedom of the press everything taken from them and little by little information became scarce and the result was a ferocious anger that erupted in several fires destroyed the main city\nThen came the flashpoint a will to power that ended in destruction and violence and it ended up in a huge war\nWhere young people were sacrificed in order to empower the leaders with a blood bond or the blood bond or a blood cement they would hold their grip on a frightened world the American people\nHave actually managed to solidly adapt to intolerant ideologies to dissent all these forms a of of\nUh you know group said to are supposed to represent neo Nazis and fascists and and then we have the anti fascist and the left wing umbrella of shades communism and and all these factions fighting together thinking there's one side or the other side wouldn't reality that there is no one side of the other side there are several factions within both sides\nAnd everybody's trying to identify them is one thing but you can't anymore\n\nI mean what are your conscious of it or not you can say that doing this\nDividing and fighting is anti liberty it really turns out to be very difficult for them you need to understand or except that's why they say well we have these guys over here that are out right and we have these counterprotesters the hour and they never say who they are\nI've never I mean maybe I can find some place by every time I have never heard anti far being spoken of by the media\n\nAnd you know the only ones I hear about are Proud Boys in antifa\nBut there's also others and you know\nWe have to learn and we have to remember that there are two main dangers to liberty right now one that comes from the left and when that comes from the right and that is this bond receive from the Warren groups of the city's literally adapting this\nBlood Samantha back in time in Germany and Hitler was blue kites they called the book the kite balloons kite demeaning blood Senate meaning that the leaders were commit acts of the accent of murder and violence and the others would follow suit\n\nAnd that's what's happening now we have a little blue ... going on\n\nIn in the deep state certainly is breathing this boots kite\nAnd we are\nHaving a little something called fascism and and ah and fighting a this is this is how we do terrorism American style this is how we do civil and civility or instability was reduced in civility uh American style\nI mean\nYou know the jak boots of course are coming from our own people now be enforced is their own people police show up I mean this kind of stand there and wait kind of a referee between the factions fighting\nBut here we are following in the footsteps of or well we're following the footsteps of do CFC we're following in the footsteps of all these guys who forewarned us it's the way I mean given all we know about what's going on\nAnd given all we know about the new world order and what it's going to do and what the new I mean this is this is the example of new world order it trades citizens like faceless statistics\nAnd economic units we bought sold barter traded in tracked\nIt lies the system why is it cheats it steals it spies it kills\nBreaks laws over reaches authority abuses its power almost every turn and they love to violent their empire so what they do is they create wars they they uh\nThey take over everything they they're swallowing up everything little by little\nSo we have this deep state that is a\nMyth superpower ... worldwide deep state a global industrial the state\nAnd so\nIt might get like you know network where are the ... says there are no Russians there are no countries there are no there is no west there's only one organized system of systems and that's money and that's takeover and that's dominance\n\nAnd that's ... that's become becoming true you know conspiracy theory but it's becoming a a a true thing\nFor everybody\nAnd that's what's the most terrifying as it is it's very true ideology we we were first afraid of terrorists\nNow we're afraid of each other we're afraid of the rising up rising up all the middle eastern terrorists and now it's us that needs to be careful because you know we have a fourth estate it's failed us\nAnd and what they have is they have these controls in place now would you be crucial in creating a warm climate of politically motivated violence\nMay want you to speak politically correct speech politically the dismissive talking points political fanaticism I mean we manufacture racial tension we've for fifty one people that we don't like\nWe burned the books in the same places we burn people\nAnd it's because of the global establishment has risen up against the people and the people responded by radicalizing political ideology that by all intents and purposes is eating us from the inside out\n\nAnd we have a large number of people that always cannot be Gabby happy with themselves and let's say pressure other ... other people into believing the whims of of of the deep state or believing the whims of this coercive solution or this course of project to get people angry at one another but see in the end\nIn the end if we're all terrorists to one another all mean to one another somebody's going to step and say well you got to clean house\n\nWe got to clean house we got to make this place say because everybody's at each other's throats then we got to go in and we got to get everybody to play nice we needed an intervention of some ...\nYou know we do that with other countries\nWe did that with other countries it it you know we always he always something going on in Iran or Iraq and we see a civil war we step in and we sending soldiers we tried to clear up the problem\nAnd how would you feel if we all are fighting like we are right now and China says you know what there's a problem we gotta send troops in and take care of the United states and when they're done they're going to thank us for what they've done for them\nThat's how vulnerable we are that that's how fragile we are you realize is that if someone decides that we're just at each other's throats too much they decided they just wanna walk in and clean house they will\nAnd boy you won't like that will you be fighting against one enemy or\n\n[laughter]\nThis is a Bloomberg market

be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this order that wants to take over to go to Jack in California hijacked or on ground zero\n[noise] ... yeah this is an interesting story but there's a couple of things to just didn't ring true to me about how you pronounce his name ...\nLike I had known to show gets ... junkie show ...\n... you know\nSo you had the Turks came out ...\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise]\nWell if they knew that these guys were there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stopped them so I think you have a the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is have you ever heard of a of\nAny nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill more people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump is a between a rock and a hard spot now because\nYou're coming up on the mid term elections and they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you could see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly\nAnd the price of gasoline would skyrocket\nWould have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of worldwide deep state manipulation it is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump it's about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence\nWith this ... this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go bust\nWell\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy ... we're looking at\nAnother indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil's going to start going up I think tomorrow can be a very bad day in the stock market if if this thing somehow\nStarts to escalate now how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ...\nIs a Saudi citizens\nAnd he was actually in a Saudi embassy which makes him on Saudi territory\nWe have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states is of no consequence the president United States has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia but you don't watch him get pressured to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to leak the story out the Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey has said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and they flew is remains I Can't remember the ... too but they will have a country\nClyde is the Turkish government had a video evidence of the team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it to\nProbably do the same reason you said that he was in a he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can get in there and embassy and do anything about it\nWell but you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey are making the argument the CIA was facilitating operation deep played operating the argument that he said operatives lady I pay for facilitators to the murder of this uh uh of cars Yogi\nAnd of course Saudi Arabian us a beep said operators were involved here as well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed to\nWhat I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more
