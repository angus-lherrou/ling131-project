the American people would they be liable for discarding that does once a marine always a marine what if in American citizens are fed up with the republics\nBureaucracies do with these leaders the decision that we're the last defense against an invasion force an invasion force should echo from here to the border\nAnd to the heavens so there's that or this brand rather should I go from here to the heavens cheers a mud Matthew I'm I ... well the the point\nIs that the border patrol has to tell people not to come into the country illegally uh but what I Will tell you and many others won't is that they're they're abusing the process\nRight now by their not technically illegals and I we all need to understand is if they show up at a port of entry and they're from Honduras and they claim that they are incredible fear of their lives\nOr nor the you know whatever the specific verbiage is that they're all using because they've been told this is what they should say they're not technically at that point illegals they will become illegals\nWhen they were led into the interior of the United states and they do not show up for their hearings or or if they're at their hearings they are\nTold that they must leave the country and they don't but it's important to get all this right and they're not technically illegals if they show up at a port of entry or even if they claim defensive asylum asylum laws are very the I shouldn't say that laws asylum process is very favorable\nAnyone who shows up in the United states and and claims that they have an asylum case so we gotta gotta remember that uh she Jay writes a book about these bomb packages I Know it's too early to tell the monies that it was the Russians they know both sides blame each other and therefore thereby resulting in more political chaos\nSimilar to how Russians pay for political ads on both sides within twenty sixteen election and\nPromote disdain TJ my friend I I Can't tell you if you're right or wrong on this one I all I can tell you is that um you know we don't know if we really just have no idea um be the way that we don't know who's behind this\nWe know that it's a it's a terrorist act and that's that's kind of where I have to leave it for now I don't know the speculation at some point can lead you down a road of well let's just say that once it turns into more wild guess territory you're really not helping yourself or anybody else out\nSo I'm trying to I'm trying to withhold my father's in how you guys know that so I ... when they're tough call that I feel strongly about them I'll make it right away\nAnd and I knew right away that it was of the fix was in against Kavanaugh and that that was all hit that was a an ambush\nUm but you know that that\nThis one I just can't tell you that I have enough of a enough of a sense of what's going on to to go to deep into it I'm just I'm just telling the truth I guess\nIs there a part of me that thinks that if you were trying to create a lot of sympathy for the Democrats are and for the left right before an election that this sure that everyone is thinking that in the back of their minds but that's not enough to say well that's what I really believe that's what the evidence leads me to believe is happening that's a different thing\nAries rides a brilliant analysis as it concerns the media's propaganda toward Trump\nThey'll sign a simultaneously say ... a Trump is in students pocket while saying he will start a nuclear arms race with Russia maybe they're flipping out over Trump's handling of the show the incident try to create the narrative the Trump is in a K essays pocket\nBecause the king of Saudi Arabia because of the narrative him being Russia's pocket isn't working out so well funny how you call the situation with case and turkey like a scene out of the Sopranos I felt the best way to handle it it was like a scene Sopranos especially dealing with these characters\nMax Boot is a disgrace I have a few of his books I won't be buying any more\nBy the way speaking of jackass is did you see Don limit reading the ten commandments with Max Boot on air and how Trump has violated\nThem uh men\nThere you go berries thanks written and man I always know that when I when I get ... areas as part of that is for that team but crew when when they write in telling me I'm doing good on something I Know I'm really really do an excellent stuff you're doing really good work 'cause if I'm if I'm mailing it in a little bit which I never do but if I'm just not\nYou know if I'm not a hidden triples and I'm just getting on first base where with some part of the show I'll hear about it I'll hear about it uh so I appreciate that area's thank you for writing and I'm\nTired of the book I Can't believe you haven't mentioned the assassination of general ... an attempted assassination of general ... in Afghanistan last week there are a lot of us veterans who depend on you to help the country remember there were still fighting Afghanistan\nYou spent a lot of time talking about the show the but not on ... what's up with that I'm giving you a partial pass because the midterms but I just uh but just you know I'm disappointed oh ss Tabitha Tabitha you're you're right you're right it it it's not\nA wasn't a a conscious choice I just got caught up\nIn the news cycle you know day to day out like everybody else that's that's trying to put together a Daily Show and a and I I uh I missed the\nI missed the boat on this one um yes there was an attempted assassination of a U.S brigadier general in Afghanistan insider threat Taliban infiltration this keeps happening and uh and and they got a general a rustic and Afghan general\nAnd you know now they're going after senior military a very senior military officers\nAnd we can't protect her very senior military officers the masters of that sends all the way down\nThe uh the chain of command is no one safe anywhere in Afghanistan now that that's the message\nAnd it just goes to show you that uh we are not\nLook we're not winning the war in Afghanistan my friends and we're not holding the line either in Afghanistan we're losing\nOur area control is receding and we think that because we don't have that many of our soldiers doing frontline patrols every day that they're not\nQuite in the same you know they're they're not really in harm's way quite the way they'd be at other stages of this war but there's still a threat and if things go really badly then it's going to be all hands on deck so to speak and that means our men and women are going to be the ones that have to keep ... from falling\nSo a tablet thank you for the reminder I did read about that story and had done some research on it I I have also reached

call me out or not get into that get into that story um and spending way too much time of the show getting but I've been telling me what the show things all about which the other people are which is really just about bashing Trump\nAnd also of journalists care more of a journalist than anybody else so uh that's going to be how we close up the freedom for today friends got to have a lot to talk
