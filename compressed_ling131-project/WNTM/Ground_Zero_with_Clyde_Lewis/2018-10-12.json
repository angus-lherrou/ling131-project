civil war\nI keep in mind that insurrection combative and revolutionary events in history had small skirmishes before the big ones are up to ... and this is why now\nWe should take a page from history and understand that we're about to witness the return\nOf what would be called the mob or the mob rule or the vigilante justice or perhaps even something a lot worse\nAnd the reason why I say this is because of the fact that a\nCouple of nights ago I did a show called new a new justice no peace and ah I attempted to point out that the traditional way we think of civil war in this country has crowding the fact that\nWe're already in one and well no one will attribute school shootings the pizza gate shootings Las Vegas attacks the symptoms of civil war in progress our leaders both left in writing knowledge that violence will be an inevitability in this country after the after the November election\n\nPresident Trump warned that there will be violence if the Republican Party loses the November's midterm elections and he stated that the rights of the American people were under threat from violent people\nAnd I'm sure he mentioned he did mention that they were on the on the left and many people have told me the left or violent Clyde you got to start talking about how the left or violent yes they are violent\nI've seen it myself here in my own home town I seen it all over the

we'll see you see you see he wants violence\nYou see the arguments are such that they can be both ways and extremism became even more intense after CNN's Christian um and poor sat down with the

speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some divinity\nJust try to make it even if we have to include disagreements we're not going to war with each other

violence\nDonald Trump said violence if the Republicans don't get the vote Hillary Clinton says violence until we get to vote or we we have this instability until we get the votes so\nThe motive of course is getting what you want by any means necessary not not that their vote matters just how much trouble intimidation and instability you can create\nIn order to change the direction of the votes and that's\nVery disconcerting and ... it's unprecedented meanwhile while the media will say that Trump's words are to be\nFact did they failed to expound upon the comments she made Hillary Clinton
