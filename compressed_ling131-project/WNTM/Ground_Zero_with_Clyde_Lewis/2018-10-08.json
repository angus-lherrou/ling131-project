you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man\nYour father was a man what kind of feelings damned towards your husband and your dad your

believed\nIn other words every now and then a woman lives and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape\nOr sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up there was a line to be murdered merged between the me too movement on one hand and went on a ... percent acceptance on the other the fact you want\nTo believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney a take off my hat and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar eyes or a victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault\nWant to believe that person but then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says that person is due process rights because that is the rigorous reaction of substantive and procedural due process that pursues the truth\nAnd make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor Ford through a any rigorous process to determine the voice you were saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people that attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was\nThe timeframe but it happened in the two front door was a kind of hard the fearing to fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out and said she was a safe\nAnd some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally is not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News\nAfter she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says you say if it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and it went in not because she needed an extra way out but because\nA small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door that had nothing to do with cost her phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying we've for little planes all over French Polynesia\nAnd ... and uh Hawaii we also went on trips to Central America to South America and Europe she had no fear of flying it was a lie but there was nothing she said fires later turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about\nFinding the truth they had a ball face mitigated allegation that could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe is mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and the person with the Y chromosome ... that's a liar\nBut then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me with the facts that's what caused a writer for the Kobe or CBS late night show to say quote aerial doom is said quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote\nFat is reflective and indicative of what the Democratic Party things today about Brett Kavanaugh we ruined his life were ruined his wife were ruined his mom and dad and were ruined his daughters\nSo aerial do most of their Steven Kobe or show\nCalled whatever happens I'm just glad we

New York west of Albany Fox's Brian Younis\nThe way this this mob rule mentality is leaving us down a path to what President Lincoln face as soon as he took office Nineteen sixty water and that is what I Am afraid of I'm not afraid of democratic control of the house with the Senate or the presidency [noise]\nI'm afraid of civil war and we're on that path and unless these people get checked somewhere and I'm not talking about suppression of vote so I'm not talking about\nThe limitations of their First Amendment rights I'm Talking about\nThem actually getting control without any facts\nTo serve born there their case without anything else they will stop at nothing when Democrats and and we're aggressive liberals in this day and twenty eight team came out with a ballot box of the court they kept one of the courts they go to the streets if they can't win in the streets the next thing is buddy revolution\n... years yet before we go to bed tonight part of the Drudge Report Michael good one who writes for a New York or newspapers has a great column about the coming second civil war read that we got to run take a look let's continue\nLet's go now to Mike in Wisconsin Mike in Wisconsin welcome to the bill Cunningham show Mike how are you\nA great Billy how are you good really I think we need to learn from\nExperience and you had an earlier caller because Brian from India that that was an inspiring phone call because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side how are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways number three I think are people like Brian saw\nNot only dishonest they are downright evil they will do nothing to get it our number two the Democrats look socialist progress is incapable of analyzing back whether it be about climate change whether it be utilized but that Dr forward present it in front of the Senate tradition\nProvable lies that still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie\nI Want to be ... say they're misconceptions but damn it they were alive because she lied about flying\nShe lied about the second front door she lied about the poor boys became one she lied about or late teens now Fifteen she lied about the fact that was the mid Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nAnd and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like them is by\nOn his political force I talked to McConnell yeah I talked to college hats off to Lindsey Graham about that political forces the only way that we are going to come and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by Bruce winning forced by beating about\nWhen you've got to vote you got to you know Schumer said one thing Saturday that was correct you got to vote in the Denver if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere is no Democrats hardly any where there's a sea of red from the the shining see it they irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone\nAnd the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president they didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts you there and look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice and\nFrom Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... meets her maker you watch that fight\nReally didn't get a thank you today\nEric Holder whose contempt of Congress to say that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of the of the Supreme Court let me see Billy for the last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven cents conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never\nQuestioned malignancy of a prominent but now all of this when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation\nAll of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimate process do you recall outrageous\nDo recall in the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it\nAnd the media had a meltdown one Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept the results ed ... elections if he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary Clinton the New York times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought accord sailor was going to win\nThen Trump won and up to this point\nHillary in the mainstream media has not accepted the outcome of the election and so they became criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election\nBecause it looked like it it's rigged however the media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary let's be clear about what are you saying and and that means he's talking down American democracy and I'm appalled that someone is the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton\nBut then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election should never accepted the ballot box\nNew York times never accepted the fact that Trump won so they became what they\nCriticize it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your call let's continue now with a Joe and New Hampshire it's been there for about an hour show in New Hampshire welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joe go ahead\nI could Mr Cunningham thanks for taking my call um I agree with everything that's been said prior to ... and your summation of everything so there's no need for me to repeat any of that but what I'm calling you about tonight is so important have you ever heard of Jonathan\nSigning his book code red about a ... issue voter mushroom Freud in America actually in the cities\nYeah I I think that there is\nA bind up him example in the city of Cleveland there were more votes cast for Obama\nThan citizens registered in certain words and and it's because the because Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio\nI'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York and whatever but Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there's hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance because there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're ... code red China concern would be an excellent guess for your show before the terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and the ... and the companies that manufacture and then they only three or four for the entire country and it's done in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine is program where the Democrat as a thousand actual votes cast Republican has an actual votes cast\nMachine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance\nAnd the person that runs the city the Democrats in most cases they're the ones that oversee the installation of the ballots for the ... term who's on the ballot what have you on the machine can be corrupted and the algorithm what would the\nWay from the Republican the end of the Democrats\nOr give me the name of the guy in the book again I'm going to talk to my producer\nJonathan Simon and the book is code red and he was a guest on coast to coast a month ago when I ... it was on her three

Senate because she turned Detroit and it largely Muslim now [noise]\nUm there's areas that Michigan like in Minnesota where\nWe don't have any choice people are not even running against or\nIt's unbelievable isn't it\n[noise] and you know we've got a proposal on our ballot which is really interesting um [noise] because [noise] you know they're they're trying to get away get away with redistricting thing because they think it favors Republicans at that moment [laughter]\nSo what do you care that proposal from the ballot now where they want to go kill which as we can keep all that will be ... by the secretary of state randomly like brand that will be you know get pending on whether the secretary of state is a Democrat or Republican [noise]\nAnd they picked like Thirteen people for sided Republican and for decided Democrat\nJohn event just just look at John James I think John James has a shot at winning that seat it would be wonderful if this was an upset how anybody in Michigan a good vote for Debbie Stabenow is beyond me\nWhat to do and you was more along becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven coming up later as coast Florida North Carolina Nevada and ah and also California bill\nCunningham the great American why would you regard was\nLosing come live with you\n[noise]\n\nReturning to Hank Aaron stadium this October thriller nights of life family brings his driver's license for nine to music playing through your car radio diaries Britain we go down ... all dancing to find your idea of the year and really nice to light thrilled can't get a dose of all ages open nightly\nFrom September twenty eight and thirty four inch rain or shine getting into this one of the time I can only be the year ... thriller night to my dot com\nFrom the moon audiologist hearing center mobiles studio making the world you're better to do is use radio seven ten W when GM\nFox News eyeballs even tropical storm Michael currently in the Caribbean would maximum winds now sixty miles an hour possibly reaching hurricane strength Monday Night or Tuesdays and approaches before in the panhandle\nIs forecast move slower and grow stronger making landfall as a category to storm mid week along the north east Gulf Coast a category to store\nThat means the panhandle Big Bend could see when the next steps excess of\nOne hundred miles per hour Florida governor Rick Scott already declaring state of emergency for areas potentially affected by the storm gas prices heading up\nGasoline prices are rising again this time up seven cents in the past two weeks the new average for regular grade is two Ninety seven diesel fuel also rose seven cents at the pumps to three twenty eight\nYear old be lumber to the lumber survey at Los Angeles the highest average gas price Houston had the lowest this is Fox News\nContext severe weather meeting face\n\nReally coming in my heroes now Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham of course the president Mitch McConnell those of us who are conservative\nOver the years have not had great feelings about Susan Collins or Lindsey Graham boil I flipped on that when they bought my loyalty for the next two years anyway there is a big deal the five conservative voices on the United States Supreme court and maybe one or two more to follow this president good to have as many as four or five selections because\nSmart money says Clarence Thomas and the next year or two of the center stays Republicans going to are going to bail out he's got twenty seven years in\nAnd he's made he's Seventy years old now good health but he's made many comments that he wants to have some life after the Supreme Court brighter is eighty and a or B gee is eighty six and bad health\nWho can and should get identified now the fourteenth amendment so the probability of one or two more appointments do a Supreme Court by this president are very good\nBecause you genuinely recalls to belong becomes available eight six six six or seven seven three three seven was go to Ben in Nevada better Nevada welcome to the bill Cunningham show Ben how're ya\nThanks for the great American\nThank you thank you I I Want to say that as President Trump nominated changes Christ himself [laughter] I'm sure they would or nail them to the crotch\nThey banned it certainly crucify bread Kevin all say that\nThey sure did and now we have Chuck Schumer one further investigation Kavanaugh how about if we investigate where I Believe to be a very suspect guests of a former Supreme Court justice\nAntonin Scalia I certainly believe ...

Cunningham show Bob how are you\nA great bill great to be with you and I have three things that I think we all my keep in mind as we go to the polls in November one is that just like you mentioned this woman who says that she doesn't care what happened she is glad she room Brett Kavanaugh's life when awful what\nThe left and the Democrats have indeed done to others they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh they will try and do to us if they can\nThe second thing is is that\nAll mine this entirely destructive behavior of attacking institutions people the people of constructive in ten of these things about our society it really to me bill is nothing less than the continued some version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties [laughter]\nWith the communist and their attempt to undermine us from within and I don't think we\nSee that but I think if we do it will provide a great context for the situation that we're in your Catholic as mine are you aware of this terrible a present state of revelations in the sex abuse is and the official cover up\nThat that was actually very much started by the communists\nWell whatever it was it's all those restaurants and we should be able to do it again let me\nTell you this path Joseph Stalin the mass murder and Soviet dictator want it to church undermine from within to neutralize the\nCemeteries and to eliminate the healing power of the church that have the Freedom Tower the church in this country a woman named ... died who was a member of the Communist Party starting in the Nineteen twenties the late twenties and for Twenty years I introduced into the\nSeminary placed in the American Catholics cemeteries\nOne thousand one hundred men who were communists and of or no overload faith or morals and according to the plot many who wears a sexually deviant one that was established\nThen successive waves bought and more of these people and they work their way into the

about time dying in the polar income caption habit of going through with it\nI think I Want to get up at like Clinton thing and I had\nA pretty interesting isn't it wonderful that the Republican Party\nWhich has become conservative of late and the president has individuals like Dianne Feinstein Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer and Dick Durban to run against\nAnd Blumenthal of Connecticut the war hero isn't it wonderful to have someone like Elizabeth Warren to run against I mean you couldn't pick these caricatures any better\nIt ... you know by that I'm kind of got caught in the game and crack the demon rats\nAnd why they have mental problems and a lot of rain but they take their personal background can live that they can get anything anything they want it and I really hope they come up
