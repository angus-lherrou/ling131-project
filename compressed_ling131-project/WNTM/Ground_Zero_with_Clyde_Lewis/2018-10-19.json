It's MORNING with Kelly Bennett's an uncle Henry on news radio sevens and somebody when the M ...\n\nI mean what we're seeing limited concepts of time\nOr hearing about how there are different dimensions we're hearing about there are different ways of thinking we're hearing that you know we're hearing in the quantum immortality I mean science is basically going all\nParanormal\nAnd they want to quantify all the paranormal in a scientific way scientific way like ah they wanted me halfway with their religion they want to eat half way with the conscious this they want to do ... and this is where I was working for about how here we are\nGoing to shift this ... this is a a major paradigm shift\nAnd we have a temporal blind spot in some regard because events happen or we perceive they do\n\nAnd then later when you're a school on the idea that everything we perceived\nAs wrong\nIs that what we think we know is not exactly what is the end that somehow we reach a point\nWhere we're satisfied with their opinion and and all that it's based on his bowl nebulous stimuli we all agree to this and it's like this is my opinion and this is\nMy truth and you say\nIt's not true if it's just what you think it is see it's all about your selective perception and we know the selective perception is necessary because we didn't have selected perception\nWe wouldn't be transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory overload we're now getting today our brains are being filled with all sorts of sensory overload thing about it we have simple perceptions of light\nLight light love survival spirituality God you know and then we're exposed to a media print television Internet videogames cell phones many other things that you know that are pushing the brain further and further\nAnd all that stimulus his place in a limited area known right there and compartmentalize area called the brain we don't know if the brain is limitless and we have we've learned that in old age would be [laughter] whose memory\nAnd we lose perception of time I mean the brain can be objective if it chooses to however it's emotion that is driving these guys and so there's this war going on between the brain\nAnd the subjective experience and this is what they called the explanatory gap where we've had to bridge the brain conscious is experiencing motion critical announces we're struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experiences worth feeling it all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\n\nAnd of course now we experienced virtual meaning hyper reality from electronic allusion it's unfortunate that we're seeing more and more people responding\nTo the electronic illusion they're becoming a non player they're becoming a person who just sits there and watch it watch things or you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script that it is to follow the follow their own hearts follow their own minds\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting for team right now\nOver what George Orwell called double speak double speak actually disguises the nature of the truth giving new meaning to words with would appear to be scripted dialogue and it's provided by the party and it's never ending\nPropaganda that keeps pushing and pushing and pushing see many people who have not had the the time nor the guess desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four\nAh by George Orwell usually you know they say things like a big brother's watching you ride ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they know a few lines right\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones are groomed to follow the wishes of the ministry of love\nThe George Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to see the possible future he predicted a totalitarian world where the government had corrupted the language forested citizenry to believe lives\nAs if they were truth and they were being tracked with a ubiquitous tell a screen that was basically extent in every home place of business and public facility today we are still the screens that are attached to our hands\nThere in virtually every communication device they are the first thing we look at it in the morning there the last thing we see at night\n\nThey are programming the masses with emails music can beams and with every algorithm we're slowly being coerced into following anything that seems to be calling our confirmation bias so this process we're not only beginning to wonder if someone is watching us we're also noticing that somebody is scripted us or is it Lee ... some people and acting like\nWhat are now being called non player characters the non player characters are NBC's or the newest name that have appeared on Twitter and Facebook and they seem to be a form of counter propaganda against the liberal left\nNow\nNBC is I mean there are there are NBC's in games gamers do it and the seas are okay\nOr actual NBC's or computer controlled characters and video games with limited scripted responses I'm given the parameters of the games which they appear for example NBC's may assigned missions to a player like in skyrim\nOr they joined a player as a companion like in fall out but they've created is NBC mean\nAnd what it is is that it's basically there to um to attack or a mock what it's called left wing propaganda and I think\n... really I I think it's being used cleverly to exploit what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like fascism\nWhere it's like not being overused outright connections to the KKK and the NBC me mocks left us and they make it it's basically getting expressionless\nFaces kind of like I'm a statement face of it and and you can see these things on Twitter read it in fortune and over the weekend Twitter responded by suspending more than Fifteen hundred accounts associated with the MP seem as they claim it violated the terms of service namely intentionally misleading election related content\nSeveral months ago unfortunate and read it the online you know where you go to look at messages on fortune read it they started using the term and PC to refer to liberals and these people said well they said that\nYou know they've joined the anti Trump crowd because they're sheep\nThey're brainwashed she that's what they believe in and they'd been conditioned apparent left wing orthodoxy in the matter of scripted characters so when you look at one of these and PCs they're basically\nThis crudely drawn great cartoon avatar has appointee nose in
