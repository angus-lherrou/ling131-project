Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all the world they're coming in how important was to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious later and it was a dinner they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight

of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just such a human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico in South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they would say so that's why I refused to call it after I said the deal with making our refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal I made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much are much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea are so\nMany jobs you're talking to my Everytime I cannot Mexico we're talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in during the Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send the piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year":
