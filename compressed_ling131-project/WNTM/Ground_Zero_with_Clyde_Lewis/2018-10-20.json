ancient mysteries and sacred a location has been featured in some of the world's largest media outlets and he's a highly sought after public speaker around the world we have him tonight Thomas shared in welcome to ground zero\n\nI tied delighted to be here again\nIt's good to have you and like I said ah it it's it's just amazing to\nBe able to have you in such a time I mean as I was explaining there seems to be like this shift in attitudes towards I guess you could call it conjuring attitudes towards what would be considered darker magic or some of the darker arts why do you think that this is starting up now why do you think there's a newfound interest in this\nI think people will be brought these ideas for all kinds\nOf reasons I think you'll have people who will be drawn to choose things like social bears there's a sense that there's an insecurity within society you see that happening in Brooklyn tomorrow at these these wages are going to bind cabinet is other people will look at things like you know\nQuantum physics and these ideas that reality is malleable to a certain extent and that\nThey will they let you want to test these ideas and they want to say well you know is it you know is the five cents reality is malleable and that kind of change it cannot ultra towards my will and still the only effective mechanism out that the dude\nIt says things like magic and so people are drawn to it for that reason as well I think also there's a there's a kind of the maturing going off the mall and that its oil is living in the age where you know people have looked at it especially in recent years we've seen like the behavior of the major religions and the crimes of\nThe Catholic Church and other organizations have been exposed quite readily and people have set themselves at these guys are on the polling things and here they are telling us that you know which ... evil so\nIt'd evil really considering the source that's coming from and then I I think that's got a lot to do it I think a lot of people have a kind of a hunger now to see if they can test the boundaries of reality using their will\nAnd it's becoming more apparent that they can uh I was just talking last night\nWith Chris Jones Riggio we were talking about this new medium that is on the Internet right now but uh certainly is causing the the left wing of the United states to be disturbed because they say it's humanizing it it's certainly\nA it's called the NBC or the the bid on playing character meaning they did the symbol of those who sound like they are repetitive Lee speaking from a script and it's very effective and I was saying to ah Chris last night I said isn't it interesting that this character\nKind of resembles the monkey was serve alchemy and it seems to be very powerful it's just a simple silk like looking character grand color very simple way drawn but it's supposed to be there is some sort of a a I guess you could call it a ... or some sort of me that it is spreading and certainly going viral and this is a form of magic\n\nI'd been taken a great interest in this as soon as that came to fruition on the electromagnetic spectrum last weekend I knew this was going to be something special\nThe like I I've been watching this whole thing around for ... the the way these people have been using ... years now and we are in a different world there's a basically\nA a generation of\nInstinctual chaos magicians who are using things like me to actually mold reality in terms of the political structure that they send it to send ... is ... is quite fascinating and not so much in its was putting out there but the reaction\nTo it it's it's it's tapped into something buried visceral and frightening in deep within the people it's been it's been aimed act it's almost like the you know that that the judgment is the mirror and the mirror has been held up to these ... these kind of like get\nCultural Marxist repeaters or whether you want to call them and they're not happy they're not happy because they wanted to believe they were special and certainly they're realizing that the only thing ... they're probably just like androids\nYeah and that's the thing is that they're saying oh the humanizing it hurts us but you're right it's like putting a mirror up to them and say look at what you're saying look at what you're doing look at what you're acting upon and it just reminded me when I saw that as\nA you know a several characters that have just been ... characters that have been effective in the past like the ... that was discovered a that was actually created that a ... a a created the among kill it so he had a ... ah the ah the one\nWe're right now but the fight happening in the TV show is between witches and war locks and whether or not a character by the name of Michael he's the Supreme which or the anti Christ said it's amazing fight because the witches are fighting amongst each other as to who was about to lead and

hundred but I Thomas shared it is with us we're so glad to have him or you've been with us today from Ireland as we talk\nAbout what's going on of course a what we were talking about earlier where the pope apparently a was at a Senate and uh he pulled out this staff it was a very familiar staff to those who are pagan do those who are which is a staff is called the staying\nAnd a conservative Catholics were appalled can view the pope's choices staff as evidence is something scary something diabolical something which she was going on at the Vatican and so you know while most folks do use\nOr what is called the feral oh a pastoral staff that uh has across the top um\nThis one was different this one uh looked then it's Thomas commented it ah it it it seems to be this staff that represents a the the nail support staff was there to the pope had a nail going through it\nAnd when you look at the iron nail in staying it symbolizes\nA lot of things uh Thomas was saying that uh that includes the ballots and that is\nBasically what unites the part of the womb is the triple motif of a threefold serpent teen to lurk came Nick uh and uh we were hearing earlier about this man or

earth when you're talking about chain of power that comes from Cain\nAnd so um we have a Thomas Sharon back you know it seems to me that and this was said uh this has been said I Can't remember where I heard\nThat when Donald Trump was elected president\nAnd Hillary Clinton was not elected president United States this basically jarred or at least a peak the rage of the feminine power and so the feminine power had to regain a a place and so now they're fighting for that power again is this why you think or is this could be why\nA witchcraft now is is being a actually is having a renaissance\n\nThomas that's a good point I never thought about that one and you hear me okay I can hear you fine thank you yeah go ahead can you hear me uh-huh yeah yeah I never yeah that's an interesting point I never thought about that the thing is that this witchcraft\nThat we're seeing like in Brooklyn tomorrow and so on it's not it doesn't come from a healthy place it doesn't come
