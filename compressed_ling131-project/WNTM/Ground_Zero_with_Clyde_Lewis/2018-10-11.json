their lives around them and I've said this to miss Molly before she she's never safer than when she's around me because\nI Would risk my life to protect her ... and I think that as my obligation as a man that is somebody who cries to uphold some standards of of honor for himself\nOr I Would if there were a threat to our physical safety I Would act or whatever way that I could whatever the costs may be so I you know I think that often gets less out of a left out of the discussion and a lot of I Know the guys listening to this program I now know exactly what I'm Talking about that the women\nIn your life not just your wife or your girlfriend or but you know the women in your life mom's friends colleagues sisters are are never as safe as well may or in your vicinity because your honor as a man is at stake the moment that any of them are under threat\nSo I just you know just trying to give the full context to this try to make sure that we approached this discussion from all sides page writes I now have a Fifteen year old daughter named Reagan Cheney listening to your podcast as well\nShe's sharing with their friends and they started a young Americans for freedom club at their school page thank you so much for shall Reagan Cheney is an awesome name and my ...\nIt was ... so I Know something about awesome names\nOr at least weird names depends on who you ask\nBut that's very very cool about your daughter and I really want to get as many of the young conservatives across the country tuning into this program and and the way we're going to do it as by telling people to listen to the the pod cast of the show a so there you have it Ronnie writes\nAh who shot the big book three friends okay this is a joke Ronnie I'll have to read this one on my own time I was like wait someone no one shot buck buck is fine he's right here\nPeter writes a book that quote whoever told you your goal in life was to be happy is from ... eight and a half when a widow Marcello must Rio on me\nOr talks to the cardinal if you like for an art films is absolutely brilliant it's one of those where you watch it again and again figure out the layers and symbolism\nActual literal translation as who told you would come into the world to be happy\nI'm I knew it was from somebody smart I a very ... writer friend of mine is one who said it to me once but it's it's an important point who told you come into the world to be happy\nThe answer is nobody really we are led to believe that by the society around us especially by the more commercial and a self indulgent aspects of the society\nAround this now because we live lives of what would have been inconceivable comfort even even\nA hundred years ago really in terms of our day to day needs and and all of that um but that does not necessarily make somebody happy does not make them feel hole and happiness is not just about\nPleasure that's really where the that's really where the the breakdown I think comes in the in the way that we all exist today\nA Caroline right table if you said something yesterday that that I've been thinking about for years the regional after so furious and on a hinge and so rabbits in their ... stations\nIs because deep down they know they don't have logical on their side every one of their ideas when enacted results and failure they simply don't have a good historic track record so with logic and facts out the window they react emotionally I think Shakespeare put it best they'd dust protest too much\nShield childcare on the first of all props for getting the Shakespeare quoted the roll call always appreciate that\nAnd on July the less get so upset yes I I think that the the weakness of their arguments is one of the reasons for their outrage right the the weakness of their arguments is one of the reasons that they are so unreasonable when presented with the opposing point of view\nWhat people tell me I'm really wrong on something and I know I'm right I don't get angry I tend to be pretty calm and serene and self assured\nIf somebody tells me that I'm wrong on something and my first instinct is oh gosh maybe I'm wrong I I can get a little defensive and I have to be aware of that because my initial impulse is to try and cover up the fact that maybe I was wrong on something I think most people are a lot of people at least have that as a as a response\nBill of rights Tom Nichols announced his departure from the GOP in the Atlantic on MORNING Joe usually Morning Joe or rejoice at this I look forward to listen to your opinion on the departure of the expert\nBill I ever had have had John Nichols on the show times in the past and he is a is a smart and we'll read guy\nAnd I think at the end of the day he is a very well intentioned\nIndividual when it comes to this country and I just I think he's so wrong on all this I really do and I don't engage with him any more publicly because\nI I don't think that he's fair minded about what you know he said recently on Twitter so I'm not betraying any confidence here but he said\nThat what the Democrats did the Kavanaugh was bad but Kavanaugh's response was worse that's just garbage I mean that's just not a defensible position that because he was snappy with them when they were calling him a gang rape is that's worse than ... than that that's just not it\nIntellectually serious position and so for somebody who takes the position in general as Tom does um that there's a lack\nIntellectual rigor among the Trump supporters\nI look I think that ah I think he's gone down the wrong path on this one he's not the only one who used to be a conservative at least he's honest though I you know give him some credit for this she says he's a Democrat now because he is he's a Democrat he so disgusted with the right that he is now playing for team left but I'm more okay with that than\nPeople who say oh I'm Still you know they pulled the Jennifer Rubin the Washington Post oh I'm Still a Republican no should not I'm Still a Republican I'm just going to trash Republicans all the\nTime no that's not how this works that's not acceptable\nSo that's how I feel about that and Max Boot whom I Know from he wouldn't remember me I was just an interim but I was in in terms of the council on Foreign Relations when he was there and he was despised by most of the people that I worked with that at the afar
