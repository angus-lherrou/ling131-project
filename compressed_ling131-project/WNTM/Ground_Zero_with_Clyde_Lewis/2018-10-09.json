interesting predictions if their predictions that to come from Nineteen forty five\nAnd a some of them are accurate some are a little off ... by just a a tad I think but\nWhen you're dealing with something called revelation to the method we have science fiction people all the time making predictions and having them come true I mean we're warned through this type of predicted programming about how we should be prepared to accept certain ideas\nCertain ... certain ideologies\nWe see in film and TV shows many things that eventually come to pass and would they do we wonder about the theory of retro causality and real time travel is these physicists have been talking about retro causality and whether or not there are things that\nShape the past future shaping the path time travel is a fantastical concept and most would consider the stuff of science fiction and yet we hear more and more that the idea of dream through time\nHe's he's he's quite possible actually a but to change the

time my little form after that that kind of thing I don't know but um it is possible we're hearing more and more about time travel is becoming more and more\nPossible plausible but um there are those who\nUs have had insight to see the future or they say they've come from the future to let us do you know through science fiction that time travel is possible and his happen from time to time and time after time or or time in ... and and that's ... ... as you\nMay know like I said I Am in the last hour I I just stumbled upon a film that I saw before called ... there was a Disney film with George
