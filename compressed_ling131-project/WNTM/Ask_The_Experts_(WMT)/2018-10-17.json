V. in Biloxi and news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the dragon mobiles news headlines coming up and about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want\nTo welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent build super build good morning\nThe morning I'll go and read them on and Kelly\nBuild there's some there's a virus that isn't affecting kids in the country a lot of people very worried about this\nYeah the CDC is also concerned about it even though at this point it is still very rare the numbers nationwide or not huge but it is concerning for a couple of reasons number one\nAs you mentioned all go Henry it really it targets children uh the average age of those who have come down with this illness which is a called a cute flaps admire light is or a F. M.\nOr the average age is four years old\nAnd Ninety percent of the cases I have been found and those Eighteen years old and younger the other part of it is that right now they have no idea what is causing this and it has shown up\nBasically nationwide while I said they're not a huge number of cases right now\nOr they're looking at a hundred twenty seven cases across the country\nIt goes from New Jersey to California to Alabama where they have some cases that are under investigation there they suspect are related to this so uh it it really is a cause for concern because right now they say it could be a virus could be an environmental toxin could be mosquito borne\nCould be something that has a genetic component to it so they are investigating and in the meantime there are some children who are suffering through this which includes\nA weakness a muscle weakness and impossible paralysis in some children\nWell it's a getting anything that affects a four year old really of course huge scare for parents\nUh and that's what's really leading to this warning from the CDC they are now saying that uh if you see your child develop a sudden a weakness in the arms and legs or maybe a grouping of the ...\nYou show features a seek immediate medical care or even though there is no treatment for this at the time being they can start a physical therapy protocols that might be able to minimize some of the effects which range or some children recover rather quickly from this\nOthers' experience continued paralysis and require ongoing physical therapy\n\nSo when did this when did this pop up is this relatively new or is this been developing over the last few months\nWell actually it has been on the radar for some years now the first cases were detected back in two thousand twelve the CDC started tracking it in Tony fourteen uh and it's interesting because it seems to focus on late summer and fall\nThat's when it's found and every two years it seems to spike I mean twenty fourteen\nYet arrives in cases twenty sixteen you had a rise in cases and here we are twenty Eighteen or the right now they say since twenty fourteen they have been documented about four hundred cases like I said it's not\nThe numbers are huge a but just the fact that it it targets children and can be debilitating is very concerning\nBecause we don't know what is causing it there's no advice on any preventative measures right you're just supposed to you're just supposed to monitor your kids and and see if they show symptoms\nYeah all they can say right now all go Henry is that you should treat this like you would treat colds and the flu a first of all get all your vaccinations this is not connected to any type of vaccination a number to frequent hand washing\nAnd if you're in an area where there are mosquitoes you should have mosquito protection either repellent or a be covered up in those situations because at this point they're not sure whether it is mosquito borne or not\nA bill for any other country dealing with is\nYeah there there it has been reported in some countries in Asia and also in Australia uh so it's not exclusive to the United states and again this is uh something\nThat leads to more of the mystery on it right now they're just really not sure exactly what causes this and and uh and there are a number of theories about it but still they're continuing to work on it and and you know the these cases continue to pop up\nWell All right well uh builds up for a thank you for your time You're welcome\nTheir egos bills or for ABC News radio national correspondent Kelly been just a a what a frightening thing if you're a parent and your kid develop something like this that no one even knows what it is\nYeah and in these cases where the diseases so rare it's not something a doctor would typically look for so I Would imagine it's even harder to diagnose if it does happen\nAnd that wow I Hope they come up with that has some answers soon ... calling us or\nWe're almost at a time in this segment of what I mentioned that if you want to see what goes on behind the scenes and hear the conversations we have during our commercial

I think that that's that common analogy is useful here as well most lasers that's what we're always telling patience\nIs really just not that uncomfortable at all now with the surface I mean we can increase the energy and as you increase the energy you're actually treating a little bit deeper and as you increase energy and you ... can be a little bit more uncomfortable\nBut with topical numbing there really is no problems with excessive pain\n[noise] what is that what are the results like ... on something like fine lines and wrinkles with the resurface\nLower a series of treatments over over time um you can see a nice improvement and violence and wrinkles and I think that also you know when you look globally you know you take a picture before you start\nAnd then a year later two years later take another you take another picture and you look at those two side by side you know see a really nice improvement or reduction of finalizing wrinkles are reduction in sun damage in just a just a healthier skin whereas if you didn't do anything\nYou would actually see the exact opposite right because the aging process even if you're someone who's taking better care of yourself in this space as we get a little bit older\nWe get a little bit wiser and solve a sudden we don't have much time as much time to get out in the sun like we did when we were younger\nEven though we're doing the right things and doing things better you're still going to see a deterioration and re skins health\n[noise] ah I've asked you about fine lines in wrinkles are so many people in the Gulf Coast do have sunspots eight spots um how does that work with something like sun spots\nYou'll definitely help reduce the some you know a lot of times what will recommend is we put patients on a good skin care regimen you know perhaps an antioxidant retinal product maybe glycol like acid product so that it will also help with those with other Sunday image\nAnd also it will help the patient keep the results that they get\nAfter the procedures are done any kind of get them in a good regiment taking care of their skin and continue to turn back the clock so to speak\nYou've been listening to board certified dermatologist Dr Thomas spender with advanced or mythology and skin care center a forefront dermatology clinic if you'd like to find out more about Dr bender and the procedures that he offers you can go to Dr benders website it ... during clinic dot com that's advanced during clinic\nDot com\nAnd one thousand dollars [noise]\nThinking word luck to you and you'll get a tax confirming ... radio in the\nState or data emitted rates apply that much to two hundred two hundred\nAfrican yet Ryan ... may I answer for\nHad our cell and having family or friends or ... financial I\nYou take a step back and let there hadn't been hanging fire and then you make a point\nI hate to point out that there's a good chance your way to Atlanta and I know you want to be able to handle the family and that meant when you're\nAnd ladies you need to try to learn that study yeah we're actually better and that and then I think you need to be involved in the planning process whether you're a male or female narrator sings all we can help make better choices for yourself and fair\nI had a holiday thick thick thick sat down and for complimentary half of\nOn line at NBC financial ... dot com\nVirginia O'Brian offers investment services through the wealth management L.

L. V. laser what do you use that for\nUm it's all very natural it sounds like so you're going that minute it sounds like it would be a very delicate complex painstaking procedure\nIs a very delicate and tedious procedure and that's why\nYou know we have a a team that is actually working with the patient generally you know in addition to the provider to myself there's going to be two other technicians who are helping with that procedure because generally takes all day depending how many are follicles we're taking\nYou know will generally do anywhere from five hundred to two thousand follicles each one of those follicle seem to have one to four hairs in it and so if you've got a a single hair follicle that's something we're going to put in the funnel heroin area okay 'cause that's what generally Guy Davis\nAnd then if you've got a two three or four or more hair follicle we're going to use that to kind of bulk up the central aspects of the scalp where are you having to use thing\nHow delicate is it wants to procedure has been completed um how does how how is the patient supposed to guard that hair with their life [laughter]\nWell and so we have that conversation with patients in and tell them hey look I mean this is\nI'm not an inexpensive procedure and something that you're taking time on your busy schedule you know don't run out and go try to run a marathon the next day or or exercise yeah take a week or two off and really the first few days are critical I mean we don't want you get down to exercise and getting your heart rate up your blood pressure up and you pop that graft out\nBut really the only three or four days and we usually tell patients at least a week to put a safety factor in there\nThose graph sorority nicely healed\nThe other thing is of course the first couple of days we don't want you because you know everyone's got great water pressure we don't want you're putting your scout running right the showerhead and blow in those follicles out and said well tell them you know the first few days you can shower but just for your scalp you know take a couple of water and just kinda gently pored over the scout and don't be real real rough with it\nSo if I have this done and I'm a compliant patient I follow your directions or what am I going to see hair grow well\nYou'll see her growing the neat thing about near graft is\nGenerally when I was in dermatology training we would we were taught that hey you put those graphs in there and even when it heals perfectly that hair that you've grafted the hair falls out of the follicle and then the regrets process starts so it's going to take you longer to see because of the ... had to fall out\nWith this is such a pristine procedure a lot of those hairs just stay in and start growing themselves\nBut it will tell patients generally about six months if the hair stays in the follicle and starts rolling you kind of put your hand up there and so that kind of perfectly you know just kinda like you're going out your beard or something\nSo does it how long does it last\nForever\nDoes follicles that we take from the ... program to last forever I mean if you're someone who's
