I'm sure you can imagine having been involved in law enforcement at that level and then have something like this pop up extremely embarrassed be yeah that's so there is a punishment there that's that's a ... and the fact that when things like this happened they live\nOn line or ever\nWrite those things are going to never ever go way not in his lifetime but it certainly makes you wonder there's always qualifications that we'll see you know passed out drunk in his car or whatever was going on but the keys were not in the ignition where they are in the rye or next so there are other circumstances it could be out there and that's why they are right is called\nBut like you said that's not necessarily going to hit the news just the fact of who he is what his position in history was and now this\nAnd also it brings up that you heard Cassie fan borough there talking to a member of the nine one one board about\nThe the issue of the fact that he's the nine one one director the position is supposed to be somebody that lives in ... county but\nAre they wave that for him they are going to be some people that that really hate hearing that and the fact that he's driving a county card to another county every day that's\nGoing to be backlash definitely some backlash on that one and I think that's justified you gotta if you have rules like that in place I think you need to leave those in place and I don't think unless you cannot find a qualified candidate I don't think there's a reason to just wave that randomly like that [noise]\nWell it's um it I Know that it's come up I'm not just on the county level but on the city level it's a complaint that we've heard from some city council people bill\nFor a number of years where they they hate to see department heads or immobile the city of mobile get hired that don't live in the city of mobile\nAnd I think they really do have a good point you know you want somebody to have a vested interest in our city\nAnd be living here with us and so when that happens it makes you wonder like what can we do to encourage people to have qualified people here in the city in those positions so is it a question of qualified folks or are they living here in mobile and then move across the baby you know for a different lifestyle what is it\nYou're listening to Angela immobile ... jewelry he is in here because coming up in the next hour or nine to ten on W.

had some new designs out so we brought a couple of each of those and we're not loaded down the shop with all these different\n... there's not a large display now a devoted to knives immobile by coincidence ... you've never if you've never been in there they have a small area devoted to knives but what you need to understand about the knives and we'll get off this topic I just want to make sure people understand 'cause you mentioned that they sold out that's not regained\nA Angelo can get just about anything you'd ever one that's got a sharp edge on it you got a gigantic catalog old\nFashioned catalog that is I mean bigger way bigger than any phonebook we've had around here\nIt looks like what the old Sears and Roebuck catalog used to look if anybody out there is old enough to remember those are like you said the old style phone books and I also wanted to mention we have the same possibilities there on the jewelry side as a matter of fact this week we just received in a shipment of ... rose gold over sterling silver rings\nSo everything from a small engagement style ring to some different bands that go with that and it's a stack of well designed it was something that an assault when she was looking at one of our suppliers catalogs and she brought some of those into the shop as well as some new jak pieces\nOh yeah I saw the jak pieces online yesterday on the mobile bay coins in ... a fine jewelry Facebook page so anyway um I just had to ask about those now I'm sure there was such an interesting thing that you sold out of them so quick\nTell us some of the things that have come into mobile bay coins and fine jewelry uh recently that are really cool items new items there\nWe have a lot of very unusual things like we mentioned those pieces a jury that Anna you know picked up those were very unusual very interesting role rose gold is extremely popular right now\nAnd rose gold over sterling silver makes it a reasonably priced item and it's very affordable Melrose go\nThe gold is ... is a metal is an element of either it's bright yellow and it's natural one hundred percent pure gold condition however you can aloe yet you can combine it with other metals fourteen karat gold for example is only about fifty eight percent goal the rest of his other stuff\nSo depending on what that other stuff is you combine it with you can change the color people talk about yellow golden white gold\nWell if you add more copper and a couple other darker metals to that gold aloe or you can make it a rose gold color almost pinkish and design huh\nOkay very interesting and a little different yeah and a lot of people like different so when ... you know they're in the catalog she ordered some of those those are at the shop I'm not sure quite yet if she's put those on display but they are available if you come in and ask for those\nOkay so are there cool items I interrupted you you know they're cool item\nAnd then we picked up a couple of more of the uh the trade dollars with the chop marks that you and I looked at a couple of weeks ago so\nWe had one of those now we have three everything from about on circulated to a much lower grade one so those were very cool run just got out a bunch of new silver dollars which were really nice and some Carson City pieces\nUm he's actually had a wide variety of things from Lincoln sense too large sense do some bus tabs so quite a variety of coins coming into the shop and available for sale and\nAlso a lot of men and proof sets now those are about the lowest price they'd been in years and years and years so we've actually seen an upsurge of people coming in since the prices are so inexpensive they're trying to fill holes in their collection and stock up on some of those and round at the heart of the collection since says meant and proves that they're so inexpensive right now\nRight now I'm a big issue this before and I want to ask you again we're we're in October Yes sir I Know that there are a lot of industries where the twenty ninth teams will start arriving anywhere between summer to the end of the year previous\nDo you have bullying items that do the same that twenty nine teams will end up showing up in your shop before we get to the end of the year\nMatter of fact very soon we actually have the queen's beast falcon that just came out that's the latest release in Queens beast series mad is actually a twenty Nineteen release even though we already have those there at the time so that is that's how they sort of stage those out so it's ready for twenty nine and it's there are a little bit ahead of the game\nThe ... already come out with the the new year of items and we're actually getting ready to order some of those I think twenty Nineteen is the year the pig if I'm not mistaken so we're going to have some big coins out there hey\nCoin Yasser Arkansas Faye\nAlmost almost bacon mhm you know sort of the predecessor to bake and you've got to get the pig first so we'll have this year the big points there should be coming in fairly soon as well a\nGreat Britain has the britannia went out silver billion piece just like the American silver evil that's coming out early so we should have some of those in as well if I'm not mistaken I think it's the end of this month the very end of October when we'll be getting those in and with those is going to be the third and the route sixty six series\nSo that's coming out as well and that's again that's not necessarily a twenty Nineteen item right it'll be tagging along with that order and that'll be the the Kansas\nPeace so I'm looking forward to seeing that come in\nYou've taught me that the silver egos is possibly the most popular bullying item in the country right and that they met them to demand they do so when did they start ... them to demand for twenty eight team\nBasically near the end of the year I'm not sure the exact date when they do that but they go through a shutdown process near the end of the year end of December where they're not mentioned in producing those anymore they're getting ready to tulip in Europe for for for producing the twenty Nineteen silver eagles and usually it's about the third week in January when the twenty ninth teens are available\nAll right so um it's it's there's always something new popping in\nThere certainly is and like we said it's it's pretty much daily and and I'd love for people to come by daily and check things out but that might be a little much for the time I once a week once every couple of weeks because if you don't do that or if you don't talk to us and let us know what you're looking for you're probably going to miss out on it we have things come in that never actually get to the cases\nBecause we know we have customers looking for those they

of the program I brought up American Eagles in the last segment asking angel low about what time of year or they're going to be getting in twenty nine teams of of of that ah when did they stop mending to demand all that kinda stuff\nLet's see that's I'm I'm intrigued by that I don't know a lot about your industry other than what you've taught me here but we see that if China is up to it in the U.S is up to you'd think that Russia would want to compete\nRight and I agree with that but if I remember correctly he told me that they are very very particular about letting\nGold and silver coins out of the country and it is they're trying to preserve their heritage got he mentioned that to me at one point in time I took that to mean old Russian coins and currency but maybe it also applies to modern bullying as well but I'll do some research on that next time round ask the expert I'll have some better answers for you\nNow I'm In Canada we talked about Canada United States does Mexico\nIt they do a ... a labor Todd and it's typically in a one ounce size but they also do some varieties and the sizes and they do some proof sets that are out there in silver that are extremely popular and fun to collect and that is also very very beautiful design\nAnd one more I Know you're probably tired of these questions on on the ... from around the world what about the middle east you know that's a that's a really good question you know they they are a lot of those countries are known for amassing some well\nThey are but they don't really do a lot with releasing a gold and silver coins that we've had some silver coins from Egypt come in a number of different times but other than that I Can't really think of anything off the top of my head you've also got to remember too though that a lot of these countries we're talking about releasing those things have\nGold and silver assets within their country and we know that the middle east certainly has a lot of oil but I don't know about how

Henry here with Angelo of mobile bay coins and find jewelry twenty two oh for government street in midtown mobiles [noise]\nWe've talked a lot about precious metals already this morning [noise] we haven't talked about the fine jewelry aspect of mobile bay coins in fine jewelry when I use the term find jewelry explain what that means Angela\nIt means that the jury we're talking about is going to be made out of precious metals now it may be mixed medals and so it could be sterling silver and fourteen care gold it could be a solid sterling silver\nSolid gold and we were talking about the carrots or sterling silver as opposed to nine nine find silver it just is talking about the amount of silver or gold\nThat isn't the metal said what the percentages are so sterling silver is Ninety two and a half percent silver\nAnd then probably a little bit of copper maybe some other metals in there but primarily silver jewelry so it's not going to stay in your skin like a piece of copper would a Cochran nickel sometime\nIt's caused a lot of allergy reaction with folks so and we're talking fine jewelry you're much much less likely to have issues with those pieces of jewelry as opposed to a costume piece of jewelry made out of copper brass and then just plated [noise]\nThere are some people listening that have not been into look at your jewelry can you describe your selection\nOverwhelming I think that would honestly be the first word that comes to mind when you walk in you see all these different pieces of jewelry and\nAll of those are unique different pieces of jewelry or if you go to the mall stores or if you go to the mall and if you can find a jewelry store and I know they seem to be closing left and right they have a lot of examples of joy they're really pretty\nBut a lot of them are the same thing just repeated over and over maybe with a different gemstones in them or larger and smaller versions of the same thing over and over again throughout the store you walk into mobile bay points and find jewelry and you look at that display of rings that are right there and every one of those rings is different and unique\nAnd now you could be looking at the silver and she could be looking at the gold rings and there's hundreds of different choices there\nWell let me let me ask you about the differences because you brought up other jewelry stores so\nThere are lots of national chains and we see their commercials especially as we head into the end of the year you're going to see all these commercials sir or they'll have mass produced items mhm maybe connected to a celebrity\nUsually where the item is based on something the ... the celebrities mama told him when there were a kid and they've got they've they've come up with some kind of a jewelry items on it um explained to the listener how the pricing is different\nWhen you have a national chain versus mobile ... how is the pricing structure different\nIt's it's drastically different in that when we buy gold and silver items we base our pricing off of\nThe the metals prices and then we may base them off of the wholesale prices of the gym stunts that are in those pieces where it when you're looking at a national chain they're they're paying that celebrity they're paying for that brandy and they're putting on some of those items and they're paying for this national marketing campaign they're putting out there\nAnd how are they paying for that by producing a whole lot of low cost but high priced items that they can pump out there under that particular brand and they can capture the profits from that we don't have those kind of profits built into any of these things so last year we had a collection of designer pieces come in at somebody was tired of", "year": "2018",
