M. and Ninety nine find enough in the jag immobile and these talks on it for nine W. B. the him Alexi Web\nNews headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent bills for Bill good morning\n[noise] I go and read them all I Want a galley\nSo we've had American military in Afghanistan for quite a while it's been it's been many years where do we stand now what is going on now in Afghanistan\nYeah in fact that anniversary just passed a Seventeen years ago this past Sunday was when we first sent people into Afghanistan so it is unbelievable that we have been there for Seventeen years and ... where we are now is they finally are going to hold a parliamentary election\nThese are elections that were first scheduled to take place in twenty sixteen uh then they were delayed because of the security fears and the upheaval in Afghanistan until\nJuly of this year than they were postponed again until October twentieth and that's when they will be held now October ... so uh in advance of this with only a week and a half to go the Taliban have now come out and called on voters and candidates to\nBoycott this election saying that it is nothing but a ... militias American conspiracy and they are ordering the Taliban fighters to attack those who are organizing the parliamentary elections so as you might imagine this most likely will keep a lot of people away from the polls\nAnd the government says they'll do their best to keep everything safe they're going to deploy over fifty thousand soldiers and police to secure the polls are but this has been a deadly year in Afghanistan for civilians I mean we've had over a thousand people killed and almost three thousand injured\nIn suicide attacks in in Afghanistan this year so you can imagine that uh the way things are very tense and have the potential of a good potential to be very violent leading up to these elections\nPay bills for was it last year that you were telling us yeah you you were reporting to me that we were dropping the didn't we drop like the ... the the the mother of all bombs in Afghanistan right after President Trump took election\nYes we did ah you're right that that was shortly after the president took office a and he was a series of incidents where first we launched missiles into Syria then we dropped the Moab Afghanistan\nA and a about a year ago is when we changed our military philosophy in Afghanistan again trying to\nCut a loosening the reins on our forces they're allowing them more opportunity to go after the enemy up but apparently a ... there hasn't been much of an impact and you have to remember this has been going on not only with us for Seventeen years\nBut a decade before that with the Russians right try to get the Taliban out of there so uh it ... and here we are uh uh just about in the same situation\nAnd there have been talks often on again about possible peace talks the Taliban now says the only way to end this war is a withdrawal of all us and NATO forces completely from Afghanistan they say they will sit down with the United states only\nAnd not the Afghan government well you'd have to think that the Afghan government will have to be involved so uh that's basically saying there will be no talks\nBuilds up or we've heard about success in in the war against terror and success against ISIS but as you pointed out Seventeen years in Afghanistan and the Taliban is still a force that\nWe are having to deal with a ... uh where I mean\nIs this oh can we expect another Seventeen years of this\nI I think we will ... if we keep groups there I think we're going to be there for a long time because of the Taliban is part of Afghan society I mean they were but they want to invoke they're strict Muslim rule\nSo it's a cultural divide as well in Afghanistan between the hardcore Muslims and those who want more of a western influence in Afghanistan like the government device Rob Donnie so there is it's\nDeep cultural divide and right now that it's a it's estimated that the Taliban control about twenty percent of the districts\nIn Afghanistan and thirty percent other are untested so that's half the country are so ... and in more in a situation where this is not just an army\nThat we're fighting the Taliban are part of society in Afghanistan that control certain districts through their type of government or how they want a governor and a ... it's it's a it's a very difficult situation to to encounter because you know on a daily day to day basis for U.S forces\nYou're not dealing with an army you're dealing with villages\nThat just happened to be controlled by the Taliban\nYeah it's it's so frustrating for us to to see the sacrifice that American servicemen and women had to make their over the Seventeen years and after Seventeen years to get to the sense that we're not ...\nThe closer to resolving the issue is just very frustrating\nCertainly is a and and it doesn't seem like there's any change in sight I think these elections will be key uh because they're twenty five hundred candidates who are running for two hundred forty nine seats so there is an interest in this election whether the Taliban can influence that remains to be seen\nBills for thank you for your time today You're welcome any time\n\nThat was builds up for NBC News radio national correspondent\nOut of time for Gulf Coast mornings

I'm familiar with uh the Gulf Coast in general um I you know I did my undergraduate or in Tallahassee and had a lot of teammates in the panhandle of Florida and spent many a weekend there\nI'm In their hometowns I have some uh extended family and the and the panhandle of Florida and my sisters in New Orleans so it was just a very logical place for us and we're extremely excited to be here\nWe're glad to have you here and\nThat you're a part of the hand and upper extremity surgeon teen at a as the ah the kind of give people an idea of all the different things that you can do what okay I always ask Dr what's your favorite procedure 'cause there's always one procedure that you just really like to do because it makes it so much of a difference for someone\nSure sure um well I have so many favorite procedures um\nI really enjoy a operating on the elbow uh that was one of my areas of interest and spend a lot of time a training how to fix a tendon and ligament ruptures around the elbow things like Tommy John surgery and a disorder biceps ruptures and repairs um\nUh but certainly all of the procedures and the hand or a major passion of mine is as well\nThat does it ... does your special to go all the way up to the shoulder or stopped short of it\nUm the vast majority of my training was ah was went up to the shoulder okay hum so primarily the elbow to the wrist in hand and fingers are but certainly a a you know a percentage of my upper extremity training did involve\nThe shoulder as well you uh you you talk about how vinyl the hands are in our day to day life the elbow or when somebody has a problem with the elbow how painful is that\nOh it can be extremely painful and extremely uh a disabling as well um the elbow is is is is very important in upper extremity function in general and can cause a significant problems\nIt's also an extremely complicated joint it tends to be a joint that a lot of orthopedic surgeons don't like to treat because it is complicated and so happens that I'm I'm I'm certainly very interested in treating elbow pads allergy\nHow do we usually end up with all the problems over extension or hitting it\nUm I I mean it can be any number of things overuse injuries around the elbow are very very common you certainly see that oftentimes in\nBaseball pitchers but also in a manual labor's people who work with their arms in their hands all day repay any sort of repetitive activity can a cause anything from a you know elbow arthritis to ah inflammation intending ... around the elbow as well as ...\nThe ligament problems or there's a lot of different muscles that cross the elbow joints and they can all be involved as well so it's a it's a complicated region of the body that has a number of a a very common path allergies associated with it\nHis surgery usually the the best answer for an elbow issue or what\nNot by not by any means there are a um a vast majority of a\nA elbow pads allergy that can be treated a conservatively meaning without surgery I'm certainly surgery has indicated for plenty of elbow problems but there\nAre a quite a few that can be treated without surgery and regardless the even the ones that do end up needing a surgery um are often treated initially without surgery because the number of those people get better without having to go through a big operation\nThat's reassuring because I think a lot of people they first thought is you know I've got something horrible wrong with my elbow and it's going to mean surgery\nRight right yeah that's true that's a common fear that uh you know patients relate to me and don't get me wrong I'm a surgeon I Love doing surgery a but I like doing it for the right people for the right reasons and to understand that that is oftentimes not the initial way that you treat these problems\nUh primarily because a lot of them get better with other treatment ... and never have to go on having a big operation\nNow you mentioned um Tommy John and you mentioned pitchers it sounds like I mean I Know that they have these sports medicine doctors that are incredible at ... sounds like there's a little bit of an overlap here\nThere certainly is and you see that throughout orthopedic surgery um were different sub specialty is within a the a a main special table with big surgery overlap\nAnd uh certainly um elbow pads allergy is one where there is considerable overlap um I got um extensive training uh where I did my fellowship\nA primarily because the athletes at the University of Virginia where I trained 'em ... it was just structured as such that any uh athlete with a sports related injury or associated with the risk or the elbow or the hand came into us within the hand division rather than the sports medicine division there\nUm but certainly there's overlap and we're both sub specialty is very well qualified to take care of these injuries\nI usually ask the questions that gets scorn [laughter]\nSo I Apologize in advance of we've we've interviewed tremendously talented orthopedic surgeons on this program from Alabama orthopedic clinic we've talked a lot about a hip replacement newer place which is there such a thing as an elbow replacement there is\nAnd it's a procedure that I'm well qualified and well trained to do the indications are very small okay um there's not a whole lot of people out there that require an elbow replacement nor meet the specific criteria for that\nHip and new replacement is much much much more common than okay hobo replacement but there is a subset of people who benefit from it greatly and it's certainly a procedure that I feel very comfortable performing\nI just I was curious about the house similar or those joints to each other I guess not as similar as I thought\nThat that is correct and the you know the technology and uh the knowledge base than the years of experience doing hip and knee replacements\nHum is far greater than uh you know what we know about doing elbow replacement surgery um it's a much newer procedure I'm relatively speaking um and like I said much fewer people are end up requiring them than it hit her knee replacement\nOkay we do need to take a break when we come back we have a lot more to ask about\nWith Dr boat ride here with Alabama orthopedic clinic you can find out more online I saw information about the doctor on line just a few minutes ago at a ... or so dot com [noise]\nOne thousand dollars now [noise]\nIt is different fundamentally different from a joint replacement in the sense that we think about it with a hip or and knee um it actually involves removing the arthritic joints in the I'm In the base of the thumb\nAnd replacing it with a tendon that we're able to borrow\nFrom the hand that has a duplicate function and putting it in there so rather than having um a bone rubbing on bone which was quite painful you basically have bone gliding across his move\nPillow of tendon um and that's a procedure I Do all of the time it's a very common procedure and patients are extremely are satisfied\nThat say that just sounds more comfortable when you when you talk about the difference between bone on bone and bones sliding on ... and it just sounds like I I I just got a sense of really sitting here thinking about that\nAbsolutely and that's what patients experience when it comes to that for sure\nSo if someone has arthritis in their hand they shouldn't just say oh well that's just what I have to live with no no\nThere are many options and and uh I'm like I said I'm a lot of the options do not you know necessarily involve an operation but there are many ways that we can treat and make 'em a patient with hand arthritis much more comfortable and functional on a day to day\nBasis I Love the thing you said about showing them how to open a jar different way well that's that makes sense if it hurts doing this don't do that is\nExactly and sometimes it's as simple as that woody to take a quick time
