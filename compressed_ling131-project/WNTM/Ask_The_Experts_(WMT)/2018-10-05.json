M. and Ninety nine to five FM to drag immobile and news talk one of four nine W. B. U. V. in Biloxi\nWe have news headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines\nWe want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent bills for Bill good morning\nYour morning uncle and aunt and Kelly\nSo tell us where is Mike Pompeo going\n[noise] uh this will be a whirlwind trip to the far east I'm not a lot of time for sightseeing here because he will start off in Tokyo or tomorrow into Sunday uh then moved to North Korea on Sunday down to South Korea Sunday and Monday and he'll cap it off with a stop in Beijing on Monday\nWow okay so yeah that's that's a lot so what what is the hope to accomplish with the strip\nWell you know what the this initially was\nYou know it's a trip to North Korea uh to meet with Kim Jong on and to lay out the framework for another summit between the Kim Jong un and President Trump\nAnd also talk about that ever elusive denuclearization issue but at this really has turned in I think has turned into a whole different trip uh his stop in Beijing on Monday should be particularly interesting uh right now the state department is only saying that he will meet with\nQuote Chinese officials ah he's not going to meet with President Xi and now there is a question whether he will even get to meet with any senior Chinese officials because\nOf the United states of course has a pretty long list of grievances now against China ranging from trade all the way down to illegal drugs to hacking at election meddling to a military activities in the south China Sea and then yesterday\nMike Pence drop the hammer delivering just or a blistering speech at a think tank in Washington regarding China he said that what Russia's doing\nPales in comparison to what China's doing and we know that Russia has meddled in our elections are everybody in the world agrees that Russia\nPoison ... that's why in a in\nA Great Britain or we just had some Russians indicted yesterday by the U.S department of justice so he's saying that that pales in comparison to what China is doing China has said this is ridiculous and that so that makes Mike Pompeo stop in Beijing all the more interesting\nSo and I think you pointed out earlier this week didn't you build them for that that we're getting along better now with North Korea than we are with China\n[noise] well I I think I ... I pointed out that or or speculated that we may be getting along better with North Korea than we are with Canada right now\nOh yeah that's right okay well I'm ... so how does a you said that he's also going to Tokyo how does that factor in\nWell or he will stop their first he'll meet with prime minister Shinzo Abe's their foreign minister or there'll be talking number one about about North Korea Japan still has some issues they would like to get resolved with North Korea\nUh and they feel the best way to do this may be with us help and a particular interest that Japan has an issue with North Korea reportedly allegedly abducted Japanese citizens decades ago some of whom are still there\nAre so they would like to clear up this issue once and for all with North Korea and also my mom pale we'll talk some trade issues with Japan as well we're about to enter into trade negotiations with Japan\nWow so this is a this is quite the trip or when you add all of the new stuff with China\nIt really is an end in a in a short amount of time I mean there's not going to be a whole lot of partying going on here\nOkay well you know I wasn't sure about Mike Pompeo in his ... his propensity to party\n[laughter] ah yeah I I don't think he's a party or but uh there's not going to be much time you'd if he was\nOkay so um I guess we have to that this was an additional thing to watch over the weekend along with the Kavanaugh but\nYeah uh and I wonder Mike Pompeo's disappointed about getting out of Washington for the weekend\nI think there's some say like I get out of Washington for the weekend\nWell bill ... thank you so much for your time today\nYou're welcome uncle Henry I have a great weekend you to Kelly\nThank you you to their egos a bills for ABC News radio national correspondent that is a big trip\nFor Mike Pompeo in the country\nSo we're about to go in our news break here at the top of the hour want to mention that you can watch behind the scenes and see what's happening by going to the news talk one oh four nine Facebook page we do have a live video during the show you can't see Kelly been at yet\nWe don't have the cameras shut up there yet but Kelly been you've decided that you're willing to go on camera now when we can set it up\nYeah it's all about who can figure out how to make that happen and I don't know if we're going to have a split screen in the future or\nI don't know I don't know technically how we'll leave that to the experts okay so but but in the future you'll be able to see both of us for now you can hear both of us though and hear exactly how this all gets on the air which some mornings is more dramatic than others [laughter]\nThat's there's a lot of truth to that article and yes or ... so that video at news talk going on for nine or the video runs during the commercial breaks as well as while we're on the air and if you want to know more about both of us you can go to our website\nUp information on Kelly Bennett and me uncle Henry can be found at news talk went on for nine dot com and on news radio Seventeen dot com you can look at all the different things that we put on our personal blog pages [noise]\nThings like that [noise] fight\nNews headlines or next along with traffic and whether we do that for you every ten minutes on the Gulf Coast mornings\n\n[laughter]\n\nThis is a Bloomberg mark had been at us\nStocks have been fluctuating this morning as treasury yields rise to seven year high the latest Jones report signals that tightening labor market that will prompt the fed to continue to raise interest rates down up Eighteen point to twenty six thousand six hundred\nAnd forty six years and the five hundred outside are about to ... percent at twenty nine o seven ... eleven pointed Seventy eight Ninety September employment report showed that while hiring cool more than four cats last month\nThe jobless rate fell to its lowest since Nineteen sixty nine three point seven percent and the youngest report was revised upwards average hourly earnings were up to point eight percent from a year earlier in September and that matched projections chairs of Tesla are down three percent\nAfter another series of tweets from Illinois mosque taking aim at the securities and Exchange Commission ... deal struck with the SEC barring him from serving as chairman for three years as a punishment for previous tweets about taking Tesla private ...

mobile bay ferry operating one boat and taking are being used in trailers twin\nWhere you are you most view and I are frauds can be\n[laughter] a hey you're sick I don't want to be okay [laughter] um [noise] a modern county uh came out of the recession a earlier than mobiles did so their their sales at two point four percent kind of reflect that they had a lot\nOf activity over the last two years or their median sales price a year to date has increased by five and a half percent [noise] uh uh their uh inventory force\nFor sale is down a a in a one point seven percent you know they have a lot of new construction\nAnd um [noise] their their unit or in August compared to twenty Seventeen\nFive hundred Ninety four units in August compared to five hundred and forty for such a pretty substantial part of their inventory so that that is why I'm\nTheir ... their units you know their unit inventory is not down as much as ... because of the new construction\nMobile has some new construction but they don't have the raw land that Baldwin county has and they've got a lot of pasture land over there right and if you drive through Daphne a Spanish for some parts of a fair hope I mean ... how you see are are sticks coming out of the ground\nUm there are inventory to sales ratio is a little bit higher than mobiles because of the uh um [noise]\nA new construction or they got about four months of inventory so still a strong seller's market in Baldwin county\n[noise] so um [noise]\nFrom doing this show with you for the last few years I've learned that in an average year\n... there would be certain cycles or ebbs and flows in sales and real estate that there would be some times of the year that would be better than other times of the year to sell what it sounds like you're telling me that it's even though we're heading into to autumn here\nUh although ...\nEven though we're heading into autumn here it's still a fantastic time to sell if\nIt isn't great market I don't think it's quite as busy as it was in the spring is when we came when we came out a a out of New Years I'm In the market was you know started going I'm really busy earlier than it\nNormally would you know like after Mardi Gras or beginning of march\nAnd the weather starts to get warmer people start thinking about buying a house\nUm and I September it was a was a was was a little off compared to say June but um [noise] excuse me [laughter]\nBut I you know the interest rates went up a little bit we had him make believe hurricane [noise] right [laughter] I say that because I had to evacuate from ... in Iowa none of vacation yeah show was not happy about ... we went back\n[laughter] to finish it um and ah you know and you had a major end of the summer holiday so ah which you know which you always having September but you don't normally you know has everything shut down for\nFor um for it or a pending hurricane and you don't always have a the interest rates kicking up so I think all of that kind of affected ah September and\nOctober seems to be busy I mean I'm busy I'm getting multiple offers still on houses\nAre so obviously there are buyers a lot of buyers out there\nSo I guess it all leads into the question I asked us all the time and that is is now a good cook it absolutely yeah if if I Want\nTo say I want if I wanted to sell my house I'd put it on the market now\nI'm I'm In the process of footing I'm a really nice house on the market and Smith field and it should be ready to put a sign in the yard maybe a week and a half to two weeks and uh\nYou know I mean I anticipate multiple offers on it it's a great house it was priced at two hundred thousand a it's almost twenty eight hundred square feet there's absolutely nothing wrong with it or it's a Creole which is popular four bedrooms two and a half baths\nA but what's going to sell it\nIs the backyard oh awesome backyard gorgeous pool I'm Jack\nAnd wood deck in addition to the you know the surround jak around the pool yeah ... a huge big lot plenty of room for kids to play despite the pool a and um it's just a great house\nOkay so so now is is it's still a great time to sell yeah and one hundred thousand is a great price for Smithfield okay so uh look for that coming up soon you check that out at ... dot com with that is ready to go so with all this or this career of yours\nWhich which you spend quite a while in real estate are you still passionate about it\nWell you know I've been doing this for almost Thirty years man at my dating myself [laughter]\nSo um yes I Am I'm very passionate I Love what I Do\nI you know if you work so much\nI mean a she's kind of like a doctor you're always on call I mean I always answer my phone unless it's eight o'clock at night and I'm I'm tired [laughter] there's nothing left\nUm but uh you know uh most of the time I answer my phone I answer it when I'm On vacation I answered on the weekend and so to be into it that much\nYou've got to love it otherwise I mean if you don't love it go find something else to do because it really it would be because it's a big part of your life and um you know I ah I I Love it because I get to help people\nOh hit their goals you know somebody always has a goal you don't sell a house and buy another one if you don't have some kind of reason for doing that [noise] um we kind of as real estate agents we kind of transition through people's lives we effect\nOr were involved with a lot of different situation say somebody you know somebody a gets out of college they get a job then they want they want to buy their first oh okay well then say or say somebody gets\nAir raid and they want to buy their first home well say then they have a baby and that home maybe isn't big enough for three people or or maybe they stay in it until they have maybe they have a second child and it really isn't big enough and they have to get a bigger house\nUm or say someone gets a job promotion so they can afford a nicer or bigger home or\nA or you know maybe they live in West Moby and they decide they want to do midtown or vice versa you know people have a lot of different reasons so or maybe the kids get you know they get rid of the kids now they have some money because they're not paying college fund fees [noise]\nBoy I my voice is terrible\nBut in order to get more money the sellers may need to do some things in order to compete in the market\nSo I'm looking I'm most people want me to tell them what they need to do well if I were going to put my house and the market I'd want to get the most money for it right so I Would do all those things so I tell them what I Would do if it were my house um\nBut it's not for me to list it they don't have to do that stuff right um so once they put it don't say you know once we do the paperwork age side they want to list with me or we're going to go over all this stuff that they're going to decide what they want to do\nAnd I'm going to wait for them to do that stuff I don't put signs in the yard until the work is finished because you defeat the purpose why do it if your initial buyers aren't going to see the ... the complete the job\nAnd those first those initial buyers are your best\nProspects because for the the first two to three weeks\nOr you're going to get the biggest pool of buyers that you ever have the opportunity to see her house because it's all those people that are looking at big pool of buyers that are looking for a house\nIf those people don't don't sell you don't buy your house then you're just going to get the um the the new buyers trickle on the market so maybe a difference of you had an opportunity say it Fifteen buyers or ten or twenty whatever\nAnd once you go through them you may only get one or two a week may get nothing a week um you know it just depends on the market so you don't want to miss your opportunity with those initial buyers\nSo you need you need to have the condition you you need to be cleaning and good condition for those initial buyers so they're not turned off by that and the price has to be right 'cause if you're trying to if you're asking twenty grand over the market value you lose that opportunity\nYou do and you never get it back um and those those initial buyers that initial pool\nAre the ones that are going to pay the most money for your house because fear of loss is is a big thing and they're going to be more inclined to make a full price offer 'em so they don't lose it and not keep looking at other houses\nSo it's important that you know I mean my the reason I get more money from my house is is because my objective is to sell it to those those initial buyers I Want to sell the house for the first thirty days\nAnd I suspect those first two weeks for buyers to buy the house and uh my objective also to get multiple offers so that I can maybe get more than the list price for that seller\nWhere you have to take a break we have
