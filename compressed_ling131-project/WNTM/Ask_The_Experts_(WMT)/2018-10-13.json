{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "Not I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there is there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThat work on them for on people\nWhile you're going to do these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of\nNegative emotional energy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and and that is\nThat came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel them\nIt accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so to negative spirits and\nSo they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homeless we clean them\nWash windows when you move into a new place a carpet paint everything but we don't we in the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air\nIs sick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment or whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent freeze the Seychelles and freeze exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because where I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all\nPeople call me who are agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and going strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways personal clarion wasn't touching anybody any ways really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there is lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes they're already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of\nFamily that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it where it all at once and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having your carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nThat are qualified extra system just about every religion\nBut the but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of work and past lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are the universe as I said before on on one of my appearances but the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which told me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you

N. T. I'm uncle Henry here with Mary from mix Ninety nine nine we continue our conversation with our guest\nFrom Alabama orthopedic clinic\nDoctors asked about right is brand spanking new to Alabama orthopedic clinic and he is a part of the hand and upper extremity surgery team\nAnd I want to talk about some of the common conditions and injuries that you deal with carpal tunnel syndrome can can you explain to me why that is I hear people talk about it all the time I don't really know what it is or what you do for it\nAbsolutely well like a lot of things in the hand or multiple treatment options for it but we'll start with what it is a carpal tunnel syndrome is a very common problem it is one of the most common conditions that a patient comes and sees a hand surgeon for\nUm it involves a pressure on the media nerve which is one of the nerves that goes to the hand um and ah causes symptoms such as\nNumbness and tingling particularly in the thumb the uh index finger and the rings and the um lung finger and portion of the ring finger from time to time I'm a if a\nLeft untreated it can continue to get worse that can cause problems waking patients up at night and I'm In very late stages can actually start to impact some of the a function of the muscles that that nerve goes to in hand what do you do for it [noise]\nUm well the uh the pressure in carpal tunnel on the nerve occurs at the level of the rest that nerve runs through a tunnel called the carpal tunnel\nIn the ... which is made up by the small bones in the uh in in the in the hand and the risk that makes the floor in the sides of the tunnel the top of the tunnel or the roof of the tunnel is made up by ligament\nThat ligament does not really serve much of a purpose um and in addition to that nerve benign tendons that bend your fingers and thumb down also run through the tunnel\nSo you have ten things nine tendons and one nerve which runs through a very small place\nSo any sort of inflammation within that tunnel and we're talking a matter of a millimeter to being the difference between that nerve being happy and having room to breathe versus not happy and when it's not happy that's what carpal tunnel syndrome is\nSo this is this something that we caused by our own behavior with our\nWrist and hand or just some people just developed at a ... from from heredity\nThat's a very good question and that's a question my patients often asked me\nAnd they have done large studies looking at that I'm a does typing on a computer all day or using your hands and manual labor all day predispose you to have carpal tunnel they've been unable to identify any association with any activity in carpal tunnel\nI'm now it is true that many workers and made people who use the computer all day get carpal tunnel syndrome but there are also people who don't really use their hands much at all who also get it and it really comes back to the fact that it's an an atomic set up to have a problem when you have\nNine nerves I'm I'm Sorry nine tendons and one nerve running through their um it doesn't take much for that nerve to become unhappy\nOkay so where do we start treatment lives with that\nSo a treatment wise it varies it depends a little bit on the severity of the carpal tunnel syndrome um and can be anything from for people who have primarily nighttime symptoms a which is you know numbness in tingling in those fingers that wakes them up at night\nUm and also can be a painful as well uh that can sometimes be treated conservatively by wearing splints at night we all tend to kind of sleep with our wrists in a flex position and that does increase the pressure and the carpal tunnel I'm In so wearing a splint at night can be helpful um\nI never even thought about how athletes [laughter] we all tend to do that and you can't control it\nWhen you're asleep so your letter you let a splint or a brace control it for you I'm a steroid injection into the carpal tunnel can be beneficial once again we're trying to decrease the ah the um [noise]\nA swelling in that area sometimes by just a matter of a millimeter to and an injection can be helpful and then last but not least is a surgery and the surgery is a relatively simple procedure I'm it normally only takes a less than ten minutes to perform\nAnd uh like I was saying the roof of that town was made up by ligament that really doesn't serve any purpose so we just clip that ligament and it opens up the tunnel and gives more room for that nerve to breathe\nAnd you have patients that show up that are convinced that got carpal tunnel and it's something else\n[noise] absolutely that does happen um and it actually can a stump a physician's as well with carpal tunnel being so common it's it's a\nYou know often it's very easy to say oh I've numbness in tingling in my hand this must be carpal tunnel but that's not true there are other nerves that can be a pinch other places in the body all the way up from the neck or where those nerves come out of the spinal cord\nDown across the uh under the surface of the shoulder\nAcross the elbow as they make their way down into the hand and rest um so there are certainly other conditions that can mimic carpal tunnel um and that's where somebody who is you know highly specialized in hand in upper extremity path allergy can be a very helpful in sorting those things out\nDo you find a lot of people under estimate the damage that it broken bones can cause in their hand or wrist or even the elbow\nYes absolutely that's something that that we see all the time I'm\nA some people were like well you people break fingers all the time and that's true they do and a lot of those can be treated successfully without a surgery um but it's really uh depends upon uh uh uh specialists are making that determination whether or not um it's it's one of the injuries that can be treated\nConservatively and a splint or a cast versus those that are\nA need an operation and the challenge there is that sometimes the difference between those two um is very subtle and so it takes somebody who has a training um in order to be able to discern a the difference between those two\nDo you deal with a lot of hand trauma cases\nAbsolutely uh the handy and risks are very very commonly injured portion of the body because we're using them all day there ah you know oh they're often around a machinery and people's work or a you know the susceptible to having things fall on them or\nUm you know in sporting events you're constantly using your hand in your wrists\nI'm In is susceptible to trauma so it's very very common thing to see\nWhat about like someone who has had a stroke can you help them regain mobility\nI'm under certain circumstances yes absolutely I'm as we all know strokes can be a devastating a a thing for a patient to experience um and often times the stroke can impact the function\nIn the upper extremity and in particular the hand or which can be a debilitating or not to be able to use your hand to take care of yourself or to perform daily tasks around the house and there are certainly operations in certain\nAre that can help restore that function it often involves borrowing attend in I'm In the hand or the risk that was a designed to serve one\nFunction and moving it to another place to take the place of a ... of a different tend and that was lost from as a consequence of the stroke\nI can you kind of I mean we have talked about so many different things can you kind of give us an overview of the kind of things you treat at and say\nOh sure absolutely we have done a good job covering a lot of those things but I'm In very general terms\nUh the vast majority of my practice involves a treating a can various conditions of the hand in the upper extremity which include a trauma to the fingers or the hand the risk the forearm and the elbow and that trauma can be in the form of\nA broken bones were dislocation that trauma can be in the form of last rated tendons nerves in blood vessels\nI'm as well as a arthritis within the hand the wrists the elbow I'm I'm as well as a nerve pressure problems such as carpal tunnel and cute little tunnel uh are very common conditions as well that of hand in upper extremity surgeon treat\nTennis elbow I ... I haven't even asked about that one that's one I keep hearing about and I'm not sure what it is\nVery common condition um if you have to play tennis to get it you do not not by any stretch of the imagination in fact the vast majority of people who I see for tennis elbow 'em or not avid tennis players by any stretch of the imagination\nA tennis elbow involves a ten at night is on the outside portion of the elbow do lateral elbow as we call it the ah a medical term for tennis elbow is lateral a kind of light is and that means inflammation around the ... of the lateral side of the elbow\nUm ... it happens a for a number of reasons but typically repetitive activities specifically activities that involve\nA extending your wrist or against resistance over and over again that causes those muscles that do that all start on the lateral EPA con dial the elbow in so doing those activities over and over again can cause problems are up there at the elbow\nOr as a as an expert on the hand do you get upset when you see someone ... [laughter]\nAsking that question we get the answer on this one is it a problem it is not a problem\nThat my kids it was [laughter]\nOkay popping the knuckles\nDo there's new evidence to suggest that it's actually a harmful in any way\nAnd do people who are double joined it such as myself is that a special power [laughter]\nDouble Jordan or in your case I think absolutely [laughter]\nWe're we're just about out of time or is there a condition we haven't gone over there that you want to make sure that we mentioned I think\nWe've done a pretty good job covering them or you know there are certainly as we've found out numerous a multitude of conditions within the hand in upper extremity that I or any uh upper extremity surgeon treat 'em\nAnd I am just really excited to be a down here in mobiles joining this community in a way that I can make a difference for the people of this community\nAll right we're at a time duck boat ride it's been a pleasure to talk to you I think married both learned a lot I didn't know you were double joined it [laughter]\nWell thank you so much as it's been my pleasure when you the listener you can learn more about Dr ... boat ride as well by going to A L or so dot com that's the website for Alabama orthopedic clinics you can learn about all their doctors all the services they provide\nAnd of course Dr boat ride is there as well again that's a ... or so dot com [noise]\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed keep informed\nPeep engaged gauge Matt ... here\nThis is just the beginning here\nIs your business to stay in Ames radio seven ten right here W when GM\nGetting ready to be in\nThis audio is for your review for ...

for almost one hundred years locally now before I go into more questions for you do you still offer the books are you still offering books to listeners\nWe are uncle Henry it's a lot of listeners have called in and oh and existing clients and what does get a copy we've got three books a one we've been given away for a while now is the stress free retirement great book right ideas you've read it oh we've got another one that\nAh the five retirement Mets burying say is just it's not you read it in thirty minutes a and then the tax free retirement ... written by the same guy Patrick Kelley who is just a a great person um the way he explains things in\nCommon sense are easy to read easy to understand and it gets people to think well maybe there are some alternatives out there to\nLike Virginia was saying to putting money in a CD or a savings account or putting money in in the stock market there's nothing wrong with having a little money everywhere diverse by they everything right and that's mainly what our plans do and uh we'll talk about in this segment\nYou know do we going off and sort of go on defense and see what happens but the book talks about that\nOkay and and the books all you've got to do is called mobile bay financial solutions to five one six six six five thousand that's two five one six six six five thousand or just to ask for the books and and no obligation\nNo obligation calling a ... will just get your address name and address and will\nMail it out to you know Johnny Neal just mentioned officer defense there's an article in entrepreneur magazine that argues that when it comes to a growing our money we have to play off ...\nRather than defense in Germany now you talked for years about defense so explain what that means one entrepreneur magazine says when he did play off debts\nWhere when we when they're saying you got a playoff aunts there are the articles very good article it talks about uh if you want money you've got to get on the up and she can't you can't win a boxing match or a soccer game without going only ... well\nUh that's true for a lot of people now depending on your age your circumstances the amount of money you have\nOr that type thing fortunately uncle Henry most people who come see us\nAnd they come to us for a number of reasons but uh most of the time when they come to us they're wanting to know hey this is what we've got can we retire now or or can we ... what kind of money can we expect to have in retirement as far as an income and for the most part if they could just hold on to what\nThey've got and earn an attractive right of return without chasing huge returns without going completely wild on the fence\nThen they're going to be just fine so what that means is if we can if we can play defense but still earn an attractive interest right we're going to be just fine and if the market does a make sometime\nCorrection a thing as of yesterday did we go into corrective territory I Can't remember a not yet not yet yeah so when we look at that but people do get concerned when they when they ah we had some money in the office on Monday and she said I don't want to sell my portfolio you know we'd\nYeah she was own up in age a little bit and and uh\nWas definitely more time in her seventies but she said and she was and she she said that now she is one that she had the financial\nAnd and you know where her financial advisors and she wants you know\nShe she wants to state we have some people that don't ever look at their ... and they have some people that she goes every night looks up all of her stocks and what they've done for the day writes them down track them very intricately I'm and she ... research is she is very very well rounded when it comes to that\nShe wasn't a financial advisor in her professional career she was um you know she she was an office manager and and and different things with benefits and things that she is just pay very close attention she was ... she said\nIf you have five myths of the five retirement Mets that's a good one and then tax free retirement oh so you're going to have stress free and tax free retirement ... that would be it would be nice so we well we [laughter]\nWay ah we're all from these books has no obligation just color office grace we'll get your name and address and drop in the mail that's it\n[noise] okay again that's to vote one six six six five thousand but we'll buy financial solutions asked for the book OR Books\nLast time you were here we talked about the tenth anniversary of the two thousand eight financial crisis and there's another anniversary to talk about nailed it was this week in Nineteen eighty seven when the market headed single biggest percentage drop in history [noise]\n\nLiving it is a day that will be in ... ... ... are covered I think identity seven when the stock market went into freefall losing more and one day that it that I'd like to say and I want it on\nSo that makes me nervous from Nineteen eighty seven yeah it uh it was a lot of a twenty two percent of its total value in that one day so um what would it mean for someone who's nearing retirement age if a crash like that happens to stay\nWell if you think about it that's just in one day and they were just ... if you just compare it to assemble ... or if you have hundreds um or or or I doubt you know you they usually are pretty pretty similar but if it's fair to the Dow index fund that's\nTwenty two percent said they have a million dollars that's two hundred and twenty dollars two hundred twenty thousand dollars that's just gone and that is you know for somebody that is um you know planning a draw 'em you know forty thousand dollars a year off of that you know that's that's roughly four percent of that million dollar portfolio\nAh that's quite a few years that they've\nLost of that power to withdraw and and they have to gain back then and only have to earn that two hundred and twenty they have to earn more on on that money because it's a it's a lesser value now\nAnd they would that would mean they would have to take more risk so it's just it you know kind of ... starts snowballing and and what happens is you have people that were in retirement like we saw and um you know I'm sure we saw this in Nineteen eighty seven and we thought this for sure and two thousand eight people that had already retired I'm retired retired very comfortably had to get back to work\nOn or people that we are nearing retirement had to keep working so\nUm that's something that you know if a weekend structure some of the money to be um like we talked about in some defensive posture as to where you know maybe only or if we go to a simple rule of one hundred\nWhich is um let's say you're sixty five well the rules on hundred says that sixty five percent of your money or your age should be protected from market risk\nSo you should all at sixty five you should only have thirty five percent of your money in the market so that way if this happens\nThat you would only have a loss of\nTwenty two percent on thirty five percent of your money so you're not as nearly as expensive as and so that's something that we look at you know and the role of a hundred isn't a isn't it sent a strict you know it's got to be this but we said something that will that we look at and look at that combined with your risk tolerance and other factors\nUm but it's something that we really take into consideration because the closer we get to retirement or when we do get into our time at the risk of these type days nobody knew by Monday was coming and nobody you know ... nobody said it's just something that you know every ... people are going to say that oh you know\nI Know when the market's gonna crash and timing the market but it's it's nearly impossible to do that I mean it it is impossible\nAnd we begin when we when we talk about protecting some of the uh some of your assets from the market ... we're not talking about burying or putting on the mattress or whatever we still have attractive alternatives we've talked about it for years on this show\nOr using certain insurance products like a fixed indexed annuity and then a lot of cases\nThere are no fees no charges or anything and Sundays and you're participating in the market gains but without the market risk\nBecause if the market goes down you don't lose anything you've seen in our dinner means I'm Larry example of Billy right one of our clients there's been a class since Nineteen uh Nineteen Ninety seven mhm yeah Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd uh we moved him in an index moody out of the market for part of his money very small part really\nAnd uh so in two thousand and eight hit or or or or two thousand two thousand one hit and market was down forty seven points during that period of time he didn't lose anything he didn't lose anything and when the more he just started going back up he went up from a point where he left off\nSo we didn't have to you spin the ten years between two thousand or eight years between two thousand one and two thousand eight gaining back money\nAnd ah and then it two thousand eighty crashed again fifty three points so that the wall street calls at the last decade if you stayed invested you got back to Yemen but it took you a long time to get back to even well if you're in retirement\n... which means you're older and you're taking money out of your retirement accounts and the markets taking money out of your retirement accounts it can be devastating you get to a point of no return you can't make up the difference because of the market drop spent twenty two percent like it did on black Monday\nBack then in Nineteen eighty seven oh just using the example of you that we've talked about earlier or in that clip from Tom Brokaw I think uh people have to make forty seven percent\nTo get back to even even though they only lost twenty two percent now they got to make forty seven percent because he had to wait to less money to her now so it's a it's devastating effect and if you compound that with\nYour taking money out to live on also it hits we call that double dipping you're taking money out and the markets taking money out now barrel a lot of ways to guarantee the income and that's what we ... we show people in our plan is less segregate these moneys into buckets keeps money at risk in the market\nBut also protect some of it this designed to produce an income that's going to last as long as you're left\nYou know another um his\nOracle thing to look at and kind of scary thing to look at but the crash of Nineteen twenty nine and black Monday of Nineteen eighty seven and the financial crisis of two thousand eight they all happened in October\nWho\nSo to Michael that it hurt when Michael [laughter] what what is it about October says well you have to begin with and all that [laughter] you at the beginning\nOf fourth quarter as what you have and so you have people going into the end of the year you have things like you know elections in November that are coming out a lot of a lot of uncertainty always around the market with elections um it's just you know October is just the end of the year and people look back and they\nIf they had expectations on what you know the GDP numbers should be it or unemployment which you know those numbers are good right now but it just things like that that I look at from the from the year it's also usually the end of the the fiscal year for most for a lot of corporations you know October that they do their taxes from October to October\nUm and so that's that's one of the things I look at look at something over at rolling twelve month period and October and so you have a lot of\nProjections a not for protections for the future and earnings from from the past that come out\nSo all these things cut a trigger people to make decisions direct in October about going forward and those decisions can impact everybody else's\nYeah and the market does not like uncertainty so when you have things like a mid term election coming up like we do and you have the uncertainty of who's going to have control of the house is going to have control the Senate um because", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "city": "Mobile", "day": "13"}
