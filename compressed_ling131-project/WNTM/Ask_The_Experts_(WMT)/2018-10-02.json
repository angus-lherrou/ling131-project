I I Would question because uh you don't know about the long term effects absolutely\nYou're listening to Belgium for NBC News radio national correspondent on another story that has to do with the economy what's going on with gas prices\nGoing up and and you're better get ready for them to go up even more because ah the situation is this so right now gas prices are at a four year Hi Brent Crude or that ... the benchmark oil is it eighty four dollars a barrel which is the highest it's been in years\nAnd everybody is now waiting to see what happens with Iran\nThose sanctions on Iranian oil or go into effect Iranian oil exports will go into effect November fourth\nIf they do that that basically takes\nOver a million barrels of oil off the market uh and that is going to have an impact some are saying that oil mediate go to a hundred dollars a barrel some in Iran are saying it could go to a hundred and forty dollars a barrel now you down their mobiles\nAre more fortunate than a lot of people your gas prices have been on the low end but still there are you at the two fifty six a gallon on average a are substantially higher than they have been over the last couple of years so we were looking for a possible spike in oil and gas prices here\nNow is this something that um I just heard you run down the factors of why does this happen generally speaking at this time of year\nWell you always hear [laughter] ah there's always seems to be a reason for gas prices to go up or down whether it be the re formulation of gas they go to the winter blend or whatever that is\nA I remember one time it was I don't remember how long ago it may have been\nTen years ago there were some pirate ditch they fired a gun near an oil rig in gas prices went\nUp [laughter] I'm Serious I remember that story\nThere always seemed to be some whether it's a refinery maintenance or some of the offshore rigs are shut down for inspections there always seems to be a reason\nFor those oil prices go up but the big reason here is with Iran which is the number three producer in OPEC with them being hit with these sanctions and the potential that their oil exports could go down to a President Trump wants to see him go down to zero\nIf that would have happened there's no way that the the the production could be picked up by other people ... the president is asking Saudi Arabia to turn up the tab there\nTo try to increase production but uh I don't think that Saudi Arabia is going to go against Iran and Venezuela by the way which is also under us sanctions in order to pick up all of that law production\nBills for thank you for your time today You're welcome Michael Henry\nTheir egos bills for NBC News radio national correspondent we're just about out of time here for this hour of Gulf Coast mornings\nThank you for listening to Gulf Coast warrant you can find out more about me more about Kelly Bennett by going to our Web sites\nLoose talk one oh four nine dot com or news radio seven ten dot com\n\n\n\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute stocks are little changed as investors turned their attention away from\nThe new NAFTA deal for now and\nFocus on a range of concerns from geo political developments to political drama in Washington D.

radio station and I'm forty nine W ... dream of we'll\nBe FBI keeps probing Brett Kavanaugh's past I'm Dave Anthony Fox News and Republican Senator Jeff flake who led the charge says he wants to be sure\nThat is the group of nations that at one point in time or another\nAcknowledge that they were a British colony and they still acknowledge the king or queen of England as their sovereign so if you look at a Canadian coin\nYou flip it over and you're like why the heck is the queen of England on this Canadian coin it's because they are part of that common wealth of nations OK geography class here for you\nTo so is it should I say that the commonwealth of nations or terrific at putting out all these great boy you know ... is it specifically the United kingdom that's good and putting out the boy\nAnd that is a great question in this case it specifically the United kingdom has games are all focused in and on and around the queen space which would be Great Britain Great Britain\nThe United kingdom uh let's see we started out with a line of England we had the dragon\nWe had the unicorn of Scotland we've had the Griffin of Edward and then we had the bowl or the black bull of Clarence and now the falcon ... with a plan hedging their bets and I've got to admit I've never really been much on\nBritish English history that's never a thing of mine other than Sherlock Holmes I Love Sherlock Holmes but after that I could have cared less\nThis has actually gotten me ... slightly more interested in British history\nOkay and these how popular are these queens beasts items\nThey have been extremely popular here at the shop and we've actually noticed it apparently globally extremely popular as well because the second one in the series the Griffin which most people don't really get terribly excited about Griffin's as a as a mythical creature\nThose are actually selling for about a hundred bucks right now so they have really really jumps up and go okay there silver is fourteen something announced ... say Fifteen dollars announced thirty dollars worth of silver at selling for more than three times the silver value those things have gone through the roof astronomically it's been pretty impressive\nHow long do you think they're going to keep making these are they almost at the end of the series\nAll their their past the midway point so their their their past hump day if you want to look at it that way this is the sixth going in the series there are ten total and they're putting these out roughly every six months so here we are in a toga or they you typically will put went out in October and six months from now there'll be put in the next one out as well\nOK well these are a great look ... really the ... and this is the falcon ... plan ... planes ...\nYeah I didn't imagine that it's don't try to say that three times quickly on ...\nMy I come from a family did struggles with with multiple syllable word [laughter] and that one is is got too many syllables for me to comfortably say on the air\nLet's let's move from that ... that great item and you can come by and and see these mobile bay coins in fine jewelry you got a couple of Darth Vader as well as a matter of fact we'll still buying Darth Vader well here's the cool\nThing to me is this is the Darth Vader we'd been carrying for a while now that's actually the twenty Seventeen version and the island of new is now released as second Darth Vader this is the twenty Eighteen version so still that great evil character as he is but a new different version and a very very beautiful proof like design on that\nAnd again flip it over and looked price around twenty five dollars very very inexpensive very reasonably priced bees\nAnd if you're in the pop culture if you bought the last one you you're probably going to have to come in and buy the new one because you know how it is once you start collecting a series or collecting a set you sort of have to continue through and get all of them\nYeah those are some pretty good look the way those are both of those even even though I'm not a fan of Darth Vader and feel that that we're worse off because of Star Wars these are gorgeous\nThey are really or just be I Can't believe you said that about one of the most iconic villains there is out\nThere well let's move away from that topic because we don't want to get into that to another Ellen idle Frankenstein is not a villain is he misunderstood and he's this under she had a monster well he's monstrous certainly but Frankenstein uh I don't consider it a horror story I consider it a wonderful science fiction tale\nBut you've got to pick that went up and again I'm letting you hold that I Know you tend to cringe a little bit when we hand you silver pieces are gold pieces and they're not protected\nAngel handed me a Frankenstein and I'm a ... would be Frankenstein monsters head describe it because this is not shaped like a coin or a bar\nWill know and it is actually a hand poured he's a silver so somebody has created a mold that will hold one and a half ounces of fine silver\nAnd that company is doing an excellent job producing these limited run pieces like this this is Frank and sons monsters head as you mentioned one and a half ounces of funds silver and thanks to the new law here in Alabama the coolest part about all of this is it's tax free you don't have to pay sales tax on that\nNow you you pointed out this is a an ounce and a half the reserves on head is an ounce and a half so\nI've seen one outside I'm ... now one and a half into art or as\nA lot of these hand where pieces they try to make them to await that will actually impact the design sometimes you start looking at the design of the item and trying to pour that much detail into a one ounce pieces just not quite going to cut it okay just like the sugar skills I showed you last time you were in\nThose were two outs peace with a little bit of detail into them and in one ounce they just don't have the same impact as they do into\nSo so the extra silver is to make it look but it's just better looking\nCorrect yeah it's more of an aesthetic part of this because they don't really look the same if you try to do them in smaller increments\nNow is this Frankenstein thing is this part of a series or just a one off\nAs far as I Know it's just a one off I Would love to see them do a whole series of the classic monsters if you will so you know you could have wolf man and Frankenstein all\nThe universal movie mom ... grade wouldn't that be a whole has ears you don't have to go through universal I'm sure that Frankenstein he become iconic everywhere he might be close to a public debate at this point\n... well you know if you think about it I guess Frankenstein and maybe you know Dracula you probably are public domain at this point in time if not they've been used so widely in so closely I'm I'm sure there's a lot of leeway and how your how your marketing those guys\nSo um what if people's reactions been to the Frankenstein head\nWell we just got that in the other day and so we put a picture out on Facebook and I wanted to talk about it today with you on the show so we've heard a lot of positive reactions they're on Facebook but we haven't actually had it on display here in the shop yet\nOkay this is just an unusual I really like this I really do [noise]\nAnd I wanted to mention to very briefly if we've got the time yes speaking of odd sized pieces this is a half of an ounce and this is a stack of all bloc one of our customers was so fascinated and we talked about that last time you were here that he is now ordering ten of those every two weeks and he is going to try to build himself an entire set of\nStack of ... really over yes or no I Can't use the L Word right\nOh well Angela it's um it looks very similar to a very popular child's toy correct popular over the over the world that starts with a letter L that that little children and immature adults use\nTo uh to build things of course and it looks like one of those so somebody did see this and decide that they want to try and build something what's a silver version of that is\nCorrect actually like the fact that he wants to buy just these plane pieces and build something really cool out of it\nBecause that that popular toy nowadays they make kits and sets where they take all the fun and exciting and creativity out of it you just assemble it the way they tell you too and I'd much rather have a toy that makes you think and create something of your own design so I'm I'm looking forward to seeing\nWhat he does once he's got enough of those to to do something\nSo he's getting Fifteen a week or ten every two weeks\nIn every two weeks wow okay well I I Hope that you'll end up putting pictures of that on your Facebook\nYeah I'm looking forward to seeing what he creates or or what do you miss and actually him and his son or both playing with the so it's going to be very interesting to see how that turns out\nAll right we have to run a we were going to take a quick break and then come back with more for mobile bay coins and find jewelry twenty two oh

athletes if you're a weekend warrior you can also take advantage of the same cutting edge minimally invasive techniques offered by Alabama orthopedic clinic\nToo um [noise] so are there are a lot of people around that are into investment grade coins that don't want just bullion that they want something like this that has significance historical says they're literally our values\nAnd and as a matter of fact some of the collectors get really excited and carried away with some of the coins like this because some of the early large sense here in the United states\nThat the guys are being cut

investment grade going [noise]\nHave we have not talked yet here immobile coins and find joy about the fine jewelry part of ... and\nThat was certainly haven't I've been so excited about the coins and the bullying and the tax free bits on that stuff I've been neglecting the the cool dory items so when it tried to showcase a couple of things that we've had come in recently they're both designer pieces one is a very very interesting ring for you to look at here\nAnd just look at all the details it's sterling silver and that center stone is not a diamond that would be a monster of a diamond if it was\nBut that's still a designer peace and just such a very very intricate detail one of the nice things I like about showing off pieces like that here at the shop or the fact that generally speaking we sell those for about one fifth of what the original price was on those out\nOkay we're we're going to get back to the one fifth part here but how would you\nUm ... um struggle handling I'm struggling to describe the ring that Angelo just hated me because you probably don't want me to use words like ... do those last year this has got this is like a wreck tech rectangular shape correct It's clear rectangular stone what would be called an emerald cut\nOr an Asher cut stone okay how would you describe the ring itself that is that's what is this\nWell it's almost got sort of the fill agree pattern or Philip redesigned all the way around the shank or the ring the shank of courses around parts that goes around your finger yes and in many instances arena is very simple and playing until it gets to the mounting itself or the stone is being set\nAnd then this one there is detail and not just detail but little Biddy stone set all the way throughout the setting itself even before you\nGet a casual notice that okay those stones I did notice that\nIsn't that amazing the amount of attention to detail that went into creating this piece is just absolutely phenomenal and you could probably sit here for the next ten minutes just perusing that ring couldn't\nYou well I mean yeah I Would I Would need to get out one of your and do you have available like jewelers loops\nWe certainly do actually carrying eliminated ... which is really handy one thing I've noticed that a lot of our customers love to do here in the deep south as they were their caps everywhere yes and so when you have a baseball cap on and you're looking at a corner a piece of jewelry\nYou're blocking all the light from above so it gets really difficult to see so we carry these eliminated loops eternal white on on your loop and you've got light right where you need to put it\nWell then that would come in handy with this ring I would call it ...\nIt is very ornate are very intricate it has a very intricate design a very detailed I just put pitchers that up on our Facebook\nPage okay now let's rewind to where you said one fifth right of what people would pay for it elsewhere how is it possible to get fined jewelry at only a fifth of what I Would pay for it elsewhere\nBut we have people that come in every day with their gold and silver collections of jewelry and not just coins in bullying but they have some jewelry that maybe has been passed down to them maybe they've changed their styles or their habits and they don't like or want to wear that type of jewelry anymore\nSo they will come in here and we'll make an offer on those pieces based off of the current market value of those items\nSo for example as a piece of sterling silver that's worth a couple of dollars as a designer piece of dory that's worth considerably more than that so we don't just put it in the silver pile and say hey we're going to offer you scrap metal prices we buy these based off of the fact that they are designer pieces and then we turn around and we have our professional jewelry finishing refurbish those\nCheck the mounting and fix anything that needs to be fixed and repaired if anything and then we put those up for sale here in the shop as a pre owned pre loved free one piece of jewelry\nBut now instead of paying five hundred or a thousand dollars or something you're going to pay one or two hundred bucks for it like I said about one fifth of the prize because we're paying somebody a lot more than what it was worth and scrap metal to get it and we passed that savings right back out to our customers\nSo somebody [noise]\nIt makes me feel badly for these people I see browsing in these big box stores\nAre looking at jewelry knowing that they're going to be paying a five times what they could have paid here\nWell you go to these big box stores or you see some of these designer brands and names that are out there and then you start to see the price tags and you get a little shocked and a little startled sometimes a little crazy", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "year": "2018", "city": "Mobile", "day": "02"}
