{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "\n\n\nOf them to go mornings with Kelly Bennett and uncle Henry where on news talk when I was ... feet and news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine five ... in ... Web\nNews headlines coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent bills for Bill good morning\nAnd go to Monica ... Kelly so the migrant Arab man how much has grown well\nSome estimates now that goes highest ten thousand a year remember this started off as about a hundred fifty people\nIn Honduras and has steadily grown in with other people joining in and all the publicity that this has gotten a ... is helping this\nAh but now you know the estimates are as high as ten thousand people are involved in this caravan which is in southern Mexico the big bulk of it anyway after we all saw the\nImages over the weekend of people gathered on that bridge between Guatemala and Mexico or they were waiting there to be processed and got impatient some ended up swimming across the river being drafted across the river others just pushed down the fence and scream through so are we do have this group in southern Mexico now\nSo what's the latest and could they actually make it to the U.S border\nStill a long way to go there Kelly over a thousand miles remain to be a covered by this group so still a long way to go and Mexico continues to try to tell these people are look I come to the processing center we will grant you asylum and and we'll go from there\nIn fact they have started placing buses now along this route because we're also seeing other suffering among the people we've seen children suffering effects of the heat or that they have encountered and the elderly with it might have some health issues or others are are are beginning to feel the pressure here\nUp physically up this track so what Mexico is down his started placing buses along the route\nAnd telling the people look anytime you're ready to jump on the bus will take you over the to the processing center you will be granted asylum in Mexico a ... a lot of people I've been unwilling to do that fearing that it will only result in them being sent back to their home country so\nUh will they make it to the United states they got a long way to go\nSit in the meantime you talk about how many thousands of people this has now become and you\nKnow they're being offered asylum in Mexico but I'm kinda curious as the conditions that they're under what kind of a relief efforts are underway or their groups and they're kind of helping them out making sure that their dad or they have water how's that situation being worked out\nWell I you know we don't have any reports of organized efforts by humanitarian groups but what we do a report solve is\nA tremendous gestures by the locals are along the route here who have gone out to meet this caravan or in some cases giving them everything from a from a water to a shoes to money in a you know there are some cases people handing out their own money\nTo some of these people to give them a little bit of cash on the way through so\nAh there have been a lot of gestures whether they're organized humanitarian effort so we haven't heard of groups that are involved in that but I'm sure they will be a just because of all the publicity that has been generated by this caravan uh so\nUh but uh the conditions continue to be bad\nSo what are we going to do if they get here\nThat's a that's the magic\nQuestion their uncle Henry the president has talked about uh putting our military down at the border or if they do make it to the United states okay even if we have our military there what do you do I mean you can't have a violent response to what these people are doing you could\nWe have an arrangement with Mexico now where we can just turn them away we don't have to\nPut them into the process if their request asylum we can just turn them away but then what happens do they set up migrant camps along the border hoping to get across any way they can even if it's illegally uh so that that remains the big question here but in the past\nThese groups that have started off in Central America and have to have the trek through Mexico\nHave really dwindled as they are the farther north they get a so I Would imagine that we're going to see a smaller much smaller number\nThat has gathered now if and when they get to the United states and truthfully now a what a Honduras Guatemala Mexico I've been unable to do Mother Nature may be able to do because we've got a hurricane\nThat is ready to hit western Mexico could be a category five hurricane or it is north of where this caravan is but still a what effects they will encounter a as they move north remains to be seen and and could cause problems for them\nWhich so so bills in for the ... you may not know the answer to this question but I'm going to ask it any way no how this number of of up to ten thousand how does that compare to what normally we have crossing the border because I keep hearing reports that some spots have four thousand apprehensions a week\nYeah uh well the numbers from September alone were pretty impressive ah for the month of September there were forty thousand people are detained at the border as illegal immigrants uh so uh I mean that the numbers are pretty big\nAh so you know even though this ten thousand people\nIs really a drop in the bucket when you look at the whole the picture altogether about just the fact that these guys are coming for all the way from Central America\nIs what is really drawing attention bills for thank you for your time today and I\nThank you for listening to the Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly Bennett and uncle Henry if you want to find

D area is awesome she [laughter] she's such a great visionary you know 'cause she can go in and see immediately you know\nWhy the flat or what's not working so um\n[noise] time you have gifts to get to your next\nMay be good\nOkay so in theory I came to visit me and to help me with my space the one thing that I loved about it was\nYou could tell what would fit in it I see that's my my greatest fear is I'm going to get the section that overwhelms the room or you know have everything up against the wall or something you help us not only with design but those space issues and making sure the furniture is going to mhm 'cause that would be just a horrible mistake to make\nYes I think scale in proportion is something that the regular you know people that aren't in this industry suffered a with and that's understandable so um that's where we come in and we can visualize uh what what accents the room and the ... uh architecture and the flow like I said\nIt's kind of like at Christmas you know you find the tree and and you say that's going to be the perfect tree for my living room and then you bring it home and they take up the entire but that's that's what a senior yeah I mean it's one thing with a Christmas tree [laughter] when you're in a bad thing and I'm sure you want to make sure you get if you don't want 'em and I think\nOh it yeah it's expensive\nWhat do you look at look at it everybody's eyes your eyes or pop and grain right away [laughter]\nNow are you trying to get us on to your do you have to call her\nAnd I will need Marion Barry an eye and force the others in black and white and a lot in your eyes would just Oregonian drying we've gone graphic [laughter] um but yeah I mean I wanted to rally you guys had a ... comics\nGreat when somebody I was just think that the area 'cause we looked at some things before and she's gone you know\nThis is\nNot going to work this Bill Maher and this is why this war so it's I'm so Tommy let's talk about your gifts\nApparently [laughter] oh that\nDoes make your eyes pop out but it doesn't hurt that I'm not I don't know [laughter] [laughter]\nLet's see what do we enjoy doing I enjoy getting to know the people and I love it when someone says oh\nI have the audit showed drunk and I'm like oh ride I Love it if there's something about that and it's just odd to them because they just did not know how to put the pieces and make them work I'm just like the one I spoke to us about earlier\nThe large sexual was in a previous home when the mood in this home it went in one spot and I felt let's reverse it so the reverse that and then realized it's a room that's open so there are only three wall so there's no all across from ...\nSo ... you know then you're stuck with it so ... are really really a functional as long as they are designed for that specific space and then it can work\nAs well and that's something that's a different about our ... as you actually can build them piece by piece a lot of places you go to the the sexual is already\nLanded in exactly you know it's left and right and that's that and you can't change it so that's always fit in your room where we are able to look at the room and build the ... to the scale of the room and how you would want it to feeding to be\nYeah I Love the I I thought that everybody did that 'cause I knew you guys did that that's not the case everywhere\nNo one size does not at all that's right so that uh so that's the beauty of of what we do but we start with the plan and that's what the essential said about the other part is on the other end of the spectrum you've got your said shows you know you've got your recliner into your room with you're brave [laughter]\nWhat you want to do is uh you you have a way you want your room to see a link to it you know we all have different personalities so our rooms have those personalities and so to bring out the personality that you want that room to have\nIts the details so what are the details you know we can get 'em you know the beauty of working with us is\nWe we know those talk and we know those points you know if you want your room to have a coastal look and feelings and you you get so for you get some fabulous [noise] uh tables you get some science but still it feels very sterile how do you bring out the small\nDetails that create for you that that ... was room that just says come sit down and kick back in ... with me and I like\nYour personality not looking at are kind of you know if you can tell that\nWe've been in the room that we didn't do a job\nThat don't don't don't die [laughter]\nSo you really that's why you ask us so many questions you want to you want it to reflect our personality\nYeah the one you you say you work hard you you know this is your space
