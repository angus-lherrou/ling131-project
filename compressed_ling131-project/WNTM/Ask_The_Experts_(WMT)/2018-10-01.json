{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "News headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines when a welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings Michael by our NBC News radio national correspondent Michael Bauer good morning\nOr good morning to you all Glenn are you happy Monday and happy October first\nHappy October first to you to show is anybody going to be satisfied with this week long FBI investigation\nUncle Henry it's D.C who's satisfied with anything nobody has ever satisfied with anything and everybody has to point fingers at everybody else except themselves I think that's where we sit here today we're\nAs of friday we know that the Senate Judiciary committee agreed to conduct an FBI investigation or to how they continued conducting the SBA FBI investigation into the background of Brett Kavanaugh which is technically what this is the president signed off on it so he's saying the president is that\nHe's given the FBI free rein in this pro but Saturday the New York times reported that the White House has asked the FBI to only question for witnesses\nAnd that would certainly seem as though that's a limitation on the type of FBI probe that can be happening here so then Sunday you had a Dianne Feinstein wrote a letter to the White House demanding that they provide to the Senate Judiciary committee a copy of the written directive to the FBI to which the White House responded\nWe haven't done anything all of the directives have come from\nYou guys in the Senate so\nWe're standing here today not knowing anything more but that both parties seemingly on some level are unhappy with the scope of this investigation that is now under way\nSo I don't know if this is all about justice for Dr Ford or for Brett Kavanaugh on his family it does seem like it's it's about making this last longer so I Would\nCertainly say I would certainly say that that's definitely spot on that is a very good point I mean you have not only a former FBI cheap James Comey who nobody wants to hear from but he's the former FBI Director has come out and said that there would be a lot of information that the FBI could find out about cabinet in a week's period of time\nBut he said that he doesn't believe this is about getting the truth out there because of the truth we're the only goal there'd be no time clock and the investigation wouldn't have been\nBrought to the table after the Senate Judiciary committee endorsed the nominee said that he thinks that this is about the Republican goal saying that there was an investigation and it didn't change their view and the Democratic goal saying that there was an investigation and they found incriminating evidence to the rail the nominee and that seems to be what this is all about\nWell so I see a couple of things that could happen and maybe you can come up with a few more but I think that uh they made in the investigation at the seven day mark and have a vote one way or the other and accept the results whether he goes through or not\nA or new accusations pop up around Thursday mhm and it and and then it becomes an open ended in ... FBI investigation or they withdraw the name\nYeah I I think I think any and all of those are possible like for instance we know that in the past twenty four hours is a former\nClassmate of Brett Kavanaugh's that's come out uh who is now an assistant professor at the north Carolina who says that are not only did Kevin I'll drink he was a frequent drink or he was a heavy drinker and when he did drink he would get aggressive and belligerent and that\nNow professor former classmate is done\nA swarm written statement that he's taking to the FBI so technically this will be put if you fall a procedure into Brett Kavanaugh's background file\nWhich is what the FBI is continuing to investigate here now does that get any further questioning are they going to sit down with his former classmate and try to get some information hard to tell at this point but it does seem like you know we know for instance Kavanaugh and Dr Ford neither one of them have been talked to by the FBI\nYet maybe it's because they have a a ton of testimony out there that the FBI would just used for the most part maybe come back with a couple of questions we know Deborah Ramirez the second accuser who claimed that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her\nShe's been talked to by the FBI\nBut Julie sweat Nick who is the third woman to come forward has not had any conversations with the FBI whatsoever so\nI think you're right I think there's a very good chance let's get to friday fast forward to fight it let's say the seven days is up there is a very good chance you're going to see a lot of screaming and yelling and fighting about what depth this investigation went to what they were able to find and you could still very well see of vote move forward maybe this time next week on the seating of Brett Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court justice\nSo I'm In we agreed that the next ... if if there is a next nominee during the Trump Administration can we agree that it'll be a woman\n[noise] it would seem as though that would be the next play right I mean that would seem as though that's the direction to go and I would think here\nUh based upon the the me too movement that's not a bad political move to go in and certainly I mean I think at the end of the day the big question that most people had over the weekend or certainly a a big number of people had over the weekend his\nIs Brett Kavanaugh the best selection is he the best opportunity for a Supreme Court justice that anybody could bring to the table or is it worth investigating\nOther possibilities maybe there's somebody who would not have these kinds of a background concerns are issues and and perhaps\nIf you're looking at a female nominee I mean listen there's going to be scrutiny and I think that that scrutiny is going to be certainly cranked up to ten or eleven or no matter who is going to be all go Henry\nBut perhaps if you can fit somebody through who doesn't have concerns in the background as much or if you've got any kind of a FBI investigation that sets up a background profile that would be the direction that go\nI guess we're looking for a nun with judicial experience\n[laughter] that's I think that would be the case yeah that would be the finite let's give it a thumbs up to everybody and\nBe able to pass on that's what they do look for\nMichael ... thank you for your time today you got to have a great rest of your morning I'll go Henry\nTheir egos Michael by our NBC News radio national correspondent what a mess it is [noise]\nThank you for listening to Gulf Coast mornings want to find out more about me or Kelly Bennett visit our Web sites news talk went off for nine dot com or news radio seven ten knocked off [laughter]\nThis is a Bloomberg Markets minute censor balancing hire a deal after the U.S and Canada reached a deal to update the north American free trade agreement General Electric is also providing a boost making a change at the time\nHe has named board member Larry ... to take over his chief executive officer a little more than a year after John flattery took the helm the company said it would also misses twenty Eighteen profit\nForecast because of weak or performance in its power business and Tesla is motoring higher after founder ... months settled the lawsuit brought by regulators over his August tweet about taking the company private mosque\nAgreed to step down as chairman and paid twenty million dollar penalty Tesla the company is also paying a twenty million dollar penalty down up a hundred and eighty one and twenty six thousand six forty the S. and P. five hundred up sixteen or six tenths percentage twenty nine thirty one\nAnd ... fifty two and a thousand in Ninety eight this report is sponsored by Hitchcock small business insurance Nina survey Bloomberg Radio\nThey might be like me and you pass by this place several times and then think about it or didn't know what it was ... for the E.

flags in Robert stale highway Ninety at the intersection and RVs I'm limited just covers the entire corner and got Jeremy strict lawyer and Sean Williams here Sean in our last segment we were talking about how it when you buy an RV\nArmies unlimited make sure you know what you're doing before you leave a lot which is I think huge and I loved what you said about we take an hour hour and a half two hours whatever you need to make sure you're comfortable not only without a hitch it up and all that but all the buttons inside\nThat's correct and even before we get to the uh walk through orientation you know a lot more goes on behind the scenes so when you decide to purchase an RV from her visa unlimited we actually take the time to put that back into our shop and I say back because\nWomen are becomes into us whether it's newer used it goes into our shop and we look at it over to make sure that it fits our standards to be put out on our laws so we can sell it\nBut once it's sold we put it back into the shop and we do a fourteen page not a fourteen point butter fourteen page inspection on the unit to make sure that every feature a function properly the way that it should be\nSo uh it's a pretty lengthy process um\nElectrical plumbing you name it we go through it um\nAnd if something needs tending to we fix it that way when it does go out on we called the point and you get the red carpet treatment um we know that we're handing over something that works properly to you that when you take it home it's not going it's not going to be a bad so\nEven a brand new R B\nYou still put it through this process such correct\nYep uh just um it's an assembly line so they go down the line they get built and it touches different people's hands and we want to make sure when it gets into our hands um that we have gone through to make sure that there were no mistakes and and believe it or not it's built by man so it's a piece of machinery and\nThey do come with mistakes and we just want to make sure that again when we get that product were handing it off to you um and that we've inspected that show up there is something that needs to be tended to that we've touched it we see it we know it and we fix it\nAs a customer I appreciate that because I Know [laughter] well I've known I've I've worked with district colors before with it and Jeremy strictly to I I Know this is the way they've always operated and I love that this is what you do RVs unlimited\nThat you know that before it hits a lot to be sold that it has already been infected and and is meat standards meet their standards but the idea that when you go to buy it you check it again that's just I mean that's got to make all your customers feel\nWell valued actually that you know that that you care enough about your customers that you want to make sure before that thing leaves in in my hands with me driving at the everything's as it should be I think that you would ship\nThat's correct them [noise] and so ... ... when we deliver 'em again you get the red carpet treatment we want everybody to be happy we take your picture afterwards\nI must have seen the pictures you had a red carpet that's grown in the face of weed out the red\nCarpet so we want everybody to enjoy that experience and we want everybody to experience that pleasure and buying from RVs unlimited [noise]\nUm [noise] so we we we go through that and provide that to you now I Will tell you this a lot of of our competitors out there um they will charge you for such a inspection and I want everybody to know that we do not charged for what we call a pre delivery inspection that as a part of our service that is a part of what we give\nTo our customers that safe peace of mind\nUm but just something to look out for the competitors do when they talk about fees they slip in their ... delivery inspection they want you to pay for it and we do not do that are already some limited we actually take pride and knowing that we're handing over a a quality unit to you that it functions and works\nAnd we don't feel that you need to pay for their [noise]\nUm so be be very very careful if you're out shopping other competitors are an ask those questions um and just to make sure that you're you're\nGetting the same treatment as you would um and not paying for it some charged for that walk through to some church for the walk through some of them charge for the additional battery\nA propane so when we when we say we're going to do a pre delivery inspection and we hand over a unit to you our units come pull propane they have a battery it in a battery box\nUm we've gone through the inspection\nAnd so ... and you get to experience does she get to see it all so we don't have any uh hidden fees and which we um which we packed back there in in in ... so I'm just to be up front and honest with everybody to make sure that if you're out on a competitor police watch out for those hidden fees [noise]", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)",
