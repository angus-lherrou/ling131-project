I'm Ninety nine and five and the jaguar Henry here with you news headlines coming up in about ten minutes John McNeil is and he's going to be on the air with me and the next hour on news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. along with\nVirginia McNeil O'Brian to talk about mobile bay financial solutions that's the new name for many LA orange labor financial group now\nOne of the stories we've covered this morning is that the postal service wants to raise the price on stamps again here is more of that from Fox\nThe postal service wants to raise the cost of a first class stamp by side since bringing it to fifty five cents total approved by regulators the increase would be the biggest we've seen since Nineteen Ninety One\nThe service claims to be leading money because of a drop in the amount of mail it carries the increase request comes after President Trump blasted the postal service for losing a fortune\nBy not charging higher shipping rates for Amazon dot com and other online retailers the service has been seeing some strong gains in package deliveries\nBut that's been outweighed by pension and health care costs in Washington Jill NATO Fox News\nSo the postal service going up wanting to go up five cents\nI'm Johnny Neal I've followed this for years how the postal unions really resist a lot of attempts to to to make changes there in the postal system or do you think they're going to price themselves out of sending things\nThrough the mail by it by continuing to go up a ... it seems like they already have I mean it's a I mean I just know in our office we don't mail a whole lot of stuff everything's done electronically yeah I\nI understand that the postal workers in the union are are very worried or unions are very worried about jobs being lost but it just seems like you're going to\nWhere we're going to continue the postal service in this country it will continue but they're going to have to make some kind of changes just as you mentioned technology has changed our habits have changed people just don't use the mail like they used to\nKnow I mean if I if when we do have to send something other than electronically ah it's usually pretty urgent and if we have to have a wet saying that you're going somewhere we're going to send it to make sure they're ten o'clock the next day right and there are other options out there that uh that allow for that\nThe the poster unions have resisted a white vehemently any change in the days that mail is delivered\nTo me that would be a quick way to make some change just dropping a day or two out of delivering while the ... that makes sense I mean what are you getting your mailbox uncle entering you'd kit junk I get junk in bills\nAnd I don't get things in my mailbox every day in fact a at least once or twice a week there's nothing there on a day when mail is delivered oh so [laughter] so what so we don't do we needed every she did we need six days a week of it\nNow and that's what the the postal truck shows up at our house on Sundays because they're delivering Amazon yes ... Amazon Prime or whatever that's that delivered on Sunday mass so that they're getting paid very well\nOh by ... medley hope so but the Trump says that the Amazon is taking advantage of the postal service but you know in any of it it is a while we need six day delivery of male and why not have it you know Monday Wednesday friday yeah something like that\nOf that ... that she used to make more sense to me because the more you go up once they observe I was talking to kill a bit about it earlier she feels like fifty five cents is no big deal\nI just think you could continue to price yourself out of people using it at all because right now most people do write letters so they're going to be mailing they're going to be mailing payments\nAnd I don't know what else what else what else we do male I think you know more and more people I Know we don't have my wife does all the bills banks you she very rarely males they check it's all done online than a year and a lot of people are scared to put my biking stuff online will\nYou know the male and the check through the snail mail is that it's safer than just pushing a button that you know\nI I Am with you on that I it's something that\nUh it's the kind of I just I just don't think you should resist change the way that they are resisting change because it's going to end up\nThey're going to end up turning making themselves obsolete yeah if they continue to resist change yeah now we're getting a part of the season where we will have stuff in our mailbox every day because they'll love Christmas catalogs will be coming out Christmas catalog send Christmas cards yes yeah\nI Wonder when when will we make that transition away from mailing Christmas cards to the electronic equivalent I guess we're getting close with Facebook and things like that yeah\nOh well\nOr almost set a time this hour um anything else you want to throw in about the Missouri game before we're out of time it's going to be you know we're going down to fifty five degrees tonight you know mobile a friday night in Tuscaloosa and the ... they'll have the bonfire for the for the homecoming bon ...\nOr there's somebody just sent me a picture of herself set up ready to go nice of you have correspondence sending you photographs while you're here yeah it's it's the one of my friends that was in school with me he owns a big they make pellets wouldn't pallets\nSo ah they supply all the palace for the bonfire and things like thirty feet three stories\nTall of pellets that are all stacked up and if you've never seen Alabama bonfire on friday of punk

OR Books now last time you were here we talked about the tenth anniversary of the two thousand eight financial crisis\nAnd there's another anniversary to talk about nailed it was this week in Nineteen eighty seven when the market headed single biggest percentage drop in history [noise]\n\nLiving it is a day that will be an ... ... ... are covered I think identity seven when the stock market went into freefall losing more and one day that it that I Walk through the and I want it on\nSo that makes me nervous from Nineteen eighty seven yeah it uh it was a lot of a twenty two percent of its total value in that one day so um what would it mean for someone who's nearing retirement age if a crash like that happen to stay\nWell if you think about it that's just in one day and they were just saying if you just compare it to assemble ... or as you have hundreds um or or or I doubt you know you they usually are pretty pretty similar but it is fair to the Dow index fund that's\nTwenty two percent said they have a million dollars that's two hundred and twenty dollars two hundred twenty thousand dollars that's just gone and that is you know for somebody that is um you know planning to draw 'em you know forty thousand dollars a year off of that you know that's that's roughly four percent of that million dollar portfolio\nAh that's quite a few years that they've\nLost of that power to withdraw and and they have to gain back then and only have to earn that two hundred and twenty they have to earn more on on that money because it's a it's a a lesser value now and\nThey would that would have to take more risk so it's just you know kind of ... starts snowballing and and what happens is you have people that were in retirement like we saw and um you know I'm sure we saw this in Nineteen eighty seven and we thought this for sure and two thousand eight people that had already retired and retired retired very comfortably had to go back to work\nOn or people that we are nearing retirement had to keep working so\nUm that's something that you know if a weekend structure some of the money to be um like we talked about in some defensive posture as to where you know maybe only or if we go to a simple rule of one hundred\nWhich is um let's say you're sixty five well the rules on hundred says that sixty five percent of your money or your age should be protected from market risk so you should all at sixty five you should only have thirty five percent of your money in the market so that way if this happens\nThat you would only have a loss of\nTwenty two percent on thirty five percent of your money so you're not nearly as expensive as and so that's something that we look at you know and the role of a hundred isn't a isn't it sends a strict you know it's got to be this but we said something that will that we look at and look at that combined with your risk tolerance and other factors\nUm but it's something that we really take into consideration because the closer we get to retirement or when we do get into our time at the risk of these type days nobody knew by Monday was coming and nobody you know ... nobody said it's just something that you know every ... people are going to say that oh you know\nI Know when the market's gonna crash and timing the market but it's it's nearly impossible to do that I mean it it is impossible\nAnd we begin when we when we talk about protecting some of the uh some of your assets from the market risk we're not talking about burying or putting on the mattress or whatever we still have attractive alternatives we've talked about it for years on this show\nOr using certain insurance products like a fixed indexed annuity and then a lot of cases there are no fees no charges or anything and Sundays and you're participating in the market gains but without the market risk because if the market goes down you don't lose anything you've seen in our dinner means I'm Larry example\nOf Billy right one of our clients there's been a class since Nineteen uh Nineteen Ninety seven mhm yeah Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd uh we moved him in an index moody out of the market for part of his money very small part really\nAnd uh so in two thousand and eight hit or or or or two thousand two thousand one hit and market was down forty seven points during that period of time he didn't lose anything he didn't lose anything and when the more he just started going back up she went up from a point where he left off", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "city": "Mobile", "day": "11"}
