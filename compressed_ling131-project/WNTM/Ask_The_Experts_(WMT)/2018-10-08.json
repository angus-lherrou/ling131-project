N. T. I'm daddy died by them the drag immobile with the news headlines coming up with about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines when a welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent Michael ... Michael good morning\nGood morning or good morning Kelly how are you this morning doing\nGreat I'm very curious about cabinet\nAnd will he will there actually be an effort to impeach him because I Can't remember somebody trying to impeach a Supreme Court justice before\nI Would say uncle Henry Kelly the effort is there now whether it's successful or not we don't know at this point but we know that even prior to his swearing in and frankly I think even maybe prior to to Susan Collins a giving her speech on the floor a petition had already begun\nAnd now that petition to impeach Kavanaugh's gathered over a hundred and twenty five thousand signatures we know that progressive groups are are raising money in a raise money to expel them from the federal bench and at least one key democratic lawmakers promised to investigate the judge if the party retake the house in November and now the key to that is\nIf the party retake the house in November So all of this on both sides for Democrats and Republicans are going to add up to what happens here in the mid term elections and and this Cavanaugh\nA appointment and the Kavanaugh swearing in is going to be a giant part of that Republicans hailing not just the swearing in is a watershed moment that will propel their party to the midterms but also highlighting\nHow Democrats acted going back to the very beginning\nOf the cabinet confirmation hearings where we saw uh the protesters and what were we saw Democrats interrupting every couple of seconds to complain that they didn't have filed all of that is something that they are going to use all the way up to the very end here\nAnd how they they brought these charges against cabinet that were\nUnheard of and and and and President Trump saying not only should a cabin or be able to get the nomination and get sworn in but also should be able to sue\nAh Christine Blasey Ford for liable on some level so all of that part of it is going to play into the next four and a half weeks share what we've got mid term elections coming up and who is able to bring more people to the table\nYeah well it sounds like what you've just said ah if if there is a noticeable effort to try it positioned to impeach him or investigate him that's going to help the Republicans isn't it\nI think it's true I think that's a very good point I Do think that that's the case 'cause it just highlights again with the Democrats are willing to do and I think you even got some some Democrats who are lifelong Democrats who are really concerned about this element of\nThe impeachment part of the more progressive part of of the Democratic party being the ones who are fired up behind this portion of it and I think you've got the the more moderate\nDemocrats going what will will will will hold on a second here listen let's get people to the voting booth let's give them a message or something that they can count on instead of just impeached this guy or not that guy won pointing at President Trump\nAnd they don't have that as of right now now is it still possible that this is all just sort of a movement to try to win over millennial voters who may be\nYou know in the past certainly haven't come out to the polls to vote and maybe you need some sort of a small reason to do it without getting into the ... the ... version of the political ISI world they just need some sort of something to stand behind perhaps a hash tag like me too that they can do that with\nThat sounds like a good plan but is it\nGoing to bring them to the voting polls we don't know in those people that millennials are generally not people who are answering much much of the the precursor ripples that we look at now\nAren't so Michael our what what is that we know the reaction from the the two political parties what about other reaction are we getting reaction from the judicial community itself\nYou you will certainly are um we do know that the former dean of the Yale Law school where Kavanaugh ... education\nUm is calling out the cabinet out confirmation\nHe actually has referred to it as an American tragedy uh and has said that the new Supreme Court justice is the black robe embodiment of Rob partisan power\nInconsistent with any ideal of an impartial judiciary so and this is what he's saying is that the testimony that judge Kavanaugh gave to the Senate Judiciary committee where he was very defensive um he said that that in of itself when he called on Democrats when he called out the Clintons when he called out\nEverybody in that fiery speech that\nIs part is that as a partisan power and that does not sit well when you're talking about the Supreme Court ah where you're supposed to be impartial\nIn regards to the judiciary in the meantime chief justice John Roberts has received more than a dozen judicial misconduct complaints in recent weeks against Brett Kavanaugh\nMost of those centering on the statements that he made during his Senate confirmation hearing so that fiery speech you you saw from him that the Republicans are touting as most importantly his ability to stand up for himself and clear his good name\nMay come back to haunt him here on a judiciary kind of a level where that highlights of partisanship and less of an ability which we know for a fact\nThat the the Supreme Court and more importantly chief John Roberts the chief justice John Roberts and trying to make sure the courts legitimacy in standing as a neutral arbiter isn't primo spotlight form this is going to challenge that\nRight well Kelly been it or not we're hoping that we will be done with this Michael by where I guess we're we're Ninety me too\nYeah I Know I was hoping to be dealt with to trust me I was hoping to be something talking about something completely different than cab and all this morning but here we are\nAll right Michael ... thank you for your time today\nYou gotta guys have a great rest of your morning\nTheir egos Michael by our NBC News radio national correspondent wow Kelly been we could be talking about this for months are you excited\nSounds like it now that excited I'll just be honest [laughter]\nWonder about people that signed these petitions and stuff like that if they really feel like it's going to have the outcome that they're hoping that well\nThey may be the only thing they ever do politically this petition thank you for

and that makes up the skin is just absolutely worn out okay just like an old driveway or an old ... dry and so what we're going to try to do is we are going to try to get rid of that old college and by literally destroying it letting your body hall at all\nAnd then tricking your body into regenerating new college in\nOkay and so that's what we start fussing with this year to laser\nUh this ... I think that's pretty good analogy so I went out there can understand\nNow there is no one and done procedure the more sun damage you have the more years we're trying to correct even with the CEO to it's going to take several treatments to take care of it and so the stimulus here too we generally tell patients enter probably be healing for five to seven days\nAnd really that's to the patients benefit because when I was in training which now is getting further and further in the rearview mirror about Seventeen years ago\nWe didn't have that option we it was all or nothing and so you literally take the entire outer layer of skin off and you let that regenerate over about a month and you can imagine with all the bacteria and viruses are environment it was really hard to keep patients from getting a secondary infection and if they got a secondary infection they had all kinds of complications so\nI'm I'm sure that there's some people that are listening that would love the idea of of a a resurfacing to use that term again\nUh but they may think well I'm sixty too many years the sun or I'm sixty five too many years the sun why even consider it can it work for somebody in their sixties\nI think it's a wonderful procedure for someone really of any age\nUm you know a number one all of us are living longer which is a good thing and so I mean I can remember my grandfather you know and he was one of these guys that do you know doesn't matter um I'm I'm leaving this Baltimore are going to see you know going to have an ... you know right I think he said that for about at least a decade or longer we buried today\nI have that person in my family to that did the same thing and we're worried about passing away Twenty years ago\nSo yeah and so I think that I'm most patients are really excited to take good care of themselves and like we like we said we're living longer patients are feeling great\nYou know seventies eighties even in their nineties there there are still active they're still getting out there uh and so I think that you know we're going to see patients getting procedures like this on up into their uh upper ... upper ages\nSo somebody sixty five Seventy years old if they come in for CEO to re Juba nation they're going to get a good result\nThey are now they're probably going to need more treatments live then if they would have come in when they were forty five or fifty five and of course that's also depending on how much sun damage that they had no if there's someone who worked outside is a PE teacher worked outside in construction or you know those types of of\nYou know employment opportunities then they're going to have a lot more sun damage and they probably need to come in sooner than someone who has an inside job most of their life you know most of us\nDidn't do the right thing in our teens and twenties why we got busy with work and kids and got a little wiser and start wearing sunscreen we did have an opportunity to get outside and so most patients that come to see us even ones who are going skin can't just say you know I haven't even been out in ... much I'm not a beach go or whatever for the last two decades but\nI tell them well what we're doing the forty years before that\n[noise] [noise] yes so the results are going to depend on how we treated our skin through the years correct but you're still going to get some results even if you come in sixty five Seventy are older you're still going to get some results yet now I when I go to advanced during clinic dot com your ... website\nI look at all the different lasers you've invested in every kind of technology possible to help people out and help people get the best\nPatient outcomes can you explain the difference in C.

N. T. I'm\nThis is ask the expert our expert today is board certified dermatologist Dr\nThomas Bender\nWith advanced or mythology and skin care center a forefront dermatology clinic Dr ... patients in Daphne in Bateman at and at his mobile office in ...\nBut it's park near Providence hospital nap you have any questions at any time about the procedures that are offered at advanced grim pathology and skin care center you can learn so much by visiting Dr benders website\nThat Web address is advanced term clinic dot com that's advantage Durham clinic dot com\nDuring this hour's conversation with Dr bender we've concentrated on some of the cosmetic procedures that are offered at advanced or a mythology and skin care center out in the last segment of the program we touched briefly on\nSomething called vanquish a doctor bender explained to us what vanquished years this is a way to get rid of excess fat around the belly\nWell basically there's two ways to get rid of an wanted fat besides exercise and the good that okay so if we're talking about a procedure rushing through as one of course we all know about ... right out\nTo you can freeze the fat which is ... and then three you can eat the fed up to a temperature in which the fat cell then explodes and then of course the volume that than the fat cells removed by your body naturally\nSo those are the three ways to get rid of it and so we have a question we will like to make was procedure because unlike crawl up policies you can treat the entire abdomen from love him loving and on one treatment\nSo saves a patient a great deal of money and they can still see several centimeters a and girth reduction with each procedure so are you serious procedure as to say it's actually one procedure every week for four weeks\nSo and we've just had good results with it and patience really don't complain of too much discomfort or anything with that and uh\nThey wish to some it's been very well received [noise]\nOkay so ah vanquish is something people need to know is an option for them you the listener can go to advance during clinic dot com and take a look at vanquished and learn more there explained to me Dr bender on the topic of uh some cosmetic procedure is how do ... fillers\nWork how do you decide when to use a terminal filler and what are they used for\nWell you know normal fillers are used to basically fill and increase the volume of areas of the face where they've lost fat usually\nIn as the aging process goes on you know we it's kinda like hair for us guys right\nWe we lose here we want to keep that we gain here where we don't want it right so uh you know the situation where basically gaining fat where we don't want it and losing it where we need it in our face and so we try to refill re volume eyes with fillers and it's and it's\nVery uh American way of doing things because it's instant gratification\nSo you come in if you don't have enough time in your lips for example we can put some ... if you don't have you know there's ... like the nasal every all falls in the lines between you know the nasal angle and and the angle of the mouth and we can fill those in with fillers maybe someone has some temporal called temporal wasting\nWhere you are you're losing ... like a sunken temporal area we can fill that in for patients\nSo there's lots of areas were trying to reverse aging and reduce that volume loss but fillers [noise]\nNow does a filler is it something that's going to be there for the rest of my life or does that does that a fade away\nIt fades away and if you have a really high metabolism it'll fade away quick or most of the fellows in the market they last around a year\nUm there are some ones like radio ... for example that we can use that that last between Eighteen and twenty four months or something called sculpture which basically forces your body to regenerate college and around the particles we inject which also last little bit longer than righty s\nSo there are options that lasts longer but sometimes that scares patients you they they especially if it's their first time they'd rather have something that they will go away at some point if they like it those come back and have some more\nThere's another procedure you all for something I'd never heard of before until I met you and that's mirror dry for excessive underarm sweating how does mirror dry work\nMirror dry uses microwave energy to centrally heat up and get rid of sweat glands in its only FDA approved for the under arms I Wish they would come up with a way to treat the palms in the soles 'cause we have a lot of patients that suffer in those areas and there's really not a lot there's not any great treatments in those areas\nBut for the armpits it's wonderful patience absolutely love it\nIf you look on line it's just one of them as ... you know love procedures because at work so well and you know when someone has hyper hydrate basis or excessive sweating of the un norms especially young ladies in or something it doesn't matter what they're doing they're not hot and they're just sweating profusely\nYou know trying to an interview for a job and that's occurred rise or try going out and buying some nice clothes that you keep ... and ruining because you're just sweating profusely and so it's very life changing for those patients\nNow is this something that requires more than one visit or ... crime be done in one visit\nWhen we're drawing first came out it was a to visit procedure so they come in once we train them they come in a couple of months later we treat them again and they were gonna get eighty plus percent reduction in sweating\nThe protocol was revamped and basically we're able now to get those kind of results with one treatment\nWe tell patients that they're one of the ... very unlucky rare few that still wants a second treatment we give them a second treatment for half price and I'm impatience I think we've had two patients and four years that thought they needed to second treatment", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "year": "2018", "city": "Mobile", "day": "08"}
