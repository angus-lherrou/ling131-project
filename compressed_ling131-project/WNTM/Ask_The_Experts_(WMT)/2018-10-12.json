{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "Four nine WVU being Biloxi and all news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the dragon mobiles we have news headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines\nWe want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent bills in for build good morning\nGood morning I'll go and read them on a Kelly\nSomeone Kanye West\nMeeting President Trump I knew it was going to be out of the ordinary but I really did not expect how out of the ordinary it turned out to be\n[noise] yeah I don't think anybody did uncle Henry and now this was a good idea that the president had get together\nA group of uh representatives from the African American community to talk about policy policy issues like prison reform in and violence in inner cities and specifically Chicago maybe gang influences on young people and things like that pretty good idea\nBut today after this and and Kanye West are\nAlmost like a stand up routine during the meeting um there's one question that people are asking that I still haven't\nHeard an answer to and it is what was that\nI I I mean if we really are trying to figure out exactly\nWhat happened here I mean Kanye West talked about everything from alternate universes to the thirteenth amendment which\nI got rid of slavery to hydrogen aircraft to the second amendment to comparing his comments to wind to hugging the president and yes the dropping the F bomb in the oval office or so or ...\nYou know what I compare this to all go Henry and and uh I I Know you'll understand this and you probably will to Kelly I think he's like the uh the enigma machine that the Germans used during World War two you know there's a message\nIn there somewhere but you got it was hard to find it wow\nOkay [laughter] a long one ask you this what he was not alone in this meeting with President Trump there were other people there\nYeah a Jim Brown or the NFL legend was sitting there as well as some other uh representatives too and one was an attorney we didn't hear them speak at all Jim Brown spoke a little bit but that Kanye West dominated the whole time\nNow I have noticed some of the records ... you'll hear a brief clip and it sounds pretty coherent and in might even be something that you agree with from a policy standpoint but as you pointed out if you listen to the whole thing\nUh it's it's almost like you might want to worry about Kanye that he's okay\nWell hey that's one of the reactions coming out today or I'll go Henry is a concern for Conyers of course he was hospitalized in twenty sixteen for what was described as a temporary psychosis and later diagnosed with bipolar disorder ah and ah but he'd\nYesterday during this uh thing in the White House said that it was sleep deprivation and not a bipolar or so for that reason he has discontinued any kind of medical regimen for that and those close to him are concerned about this\nOr that they say that that he should be back on his regular medical regimen or that he is a band and and and for that reason there was concern about Kanye also uh some criticism coming out of course for the president that\nUh he allowed this to continue on at the same time that\nUh we had a the wall by you know the ... going down another five hundred points and we're seeing all the scenes of devastation from Florida and the death toll rising and we have a serious foreign policy issue developing with Saudi Arabia or but yet the president allowed ... to go on his rap for about Fifteen minutes\nWhat about fall out for ... sorry Kelly Bennett\nWe're getting a lot of reaction are you know there has been some positive reaction to this saying that uh that it was it was great for the president to do this and Kanye West is yeah he's a character but he does bring up some important issues\nBut then you have others like another rapper TI you know I'm not familiar with them but apparently a colleague of ... called repulsive and disgraceful an embarrassing\nAxle rose from gums and roses actually a responded calling it a joke\nOr Don Lemon the CNN commentator said he called it a minstrel show so it really uh most of the reaction we see was very critical\nOf of of ... performance will say during this meeting\nYou've got to wonder if the president is thinking to themselves that you know he's going to touch on some important topics with some\nInfluential people like Kanye but it's such a loose screw I mean I think most of us remember him most\nFrom the uh American music awards I just was where Taylor Swift was getting an award and he came up and interrupted and said beyond said deserved it yeah I I Wonder if he's got a mental issue or if he's just an attention seekers and he does this kind of thing on purpose\nI think it's a little of both actually you know boy this diagnosis or\nA couple of years ago a of perhaps a some type of a mental disorder or medical disorder Andy yeah see of course he's attention seeking he's a he's a celebrity he's a he's a an entertainer of course he has attention seeking so I think it's a combination of both\nCan't believe he really is I'm Sorry I'm Glad he's taken a lot of grief ... supported President Trump that which I think is really interesting and here's why because\nWe are so politically divided in this country right now that you can't talk politics it's aims without an argument\n[noise] political we're at a time we could\nOnce you've got ... million axle rose we could talk for hours [laughter] [laughter] I don't have time yeah\n... thank you for your time have a great weekend you to ... and Kelly Bennett and I will be back with you

N. T. and would marry from mixed Ninety nine nine and our guests from operation reconnect\nTrying and Mali Sherry are are here to talk about this program that started really out of\nYour experience as a family trying to reconnect and then when you share that experience with a buddy or when you were deployed in Afghanistan you realize that not everybody had this opportunity to spend time with each other but I think I I just want to touch again on why it's so important\nFor you know families to reconnect after a deployment you went to Afghanistan twice in four years yes ma'am and when he came back home and nothing had changed right\n[laughter] well [laughter]\nI a lot changes over time and you don't realize how your life changes day to day until somebody steps out of the situation\nAnd then just comes back into the situation months later and your family lives have really changed like I mean when he when you take 'em to the airport and they get on that airplane ... your family life is one way\nAnd then me and the kids every day our life continues to evolve the kids go they change their likes grow and change\nWell when they come back for the service member though\nThey're looking for that day they left that's exactly where they left off ... and it's very difficult for everybody to sort of get back on the the same page kind of things changed while he was going\nWell like the very well when our son was younger on our first deployment a huge thing was you know when they leave\nOur three year old only drinks from the red cop or only likes this certain book to be read at bedtime you know and everything is very regimented and then then the service number comes back you always feel so bad when they go and reach for the red cup and you have to be like ooh\n[noise] we don't like the red cup anymore we liked the blue cup we don't read that story anymore he likes the story there is just for the civil wars in a different\nSaying what reorganization [laughter] that seemed very normal that you forget that win fifty little things change that's a huge change for someone to come back to win fifty little things are ... have changed over time and\nYou know and when they come back it's life just is still resumes it's like okay well you got off the airplane and we were everybody's excited but you know for us it's we have cheer practiced tomorrow and we have T. ball practice and we need to go to the grocery store when you do all these things you never really get that time to just\nReally hey Hi this is how our life goes now like welcome back\nYou know you see the big reunions and yes those are so amazing and those are amazing points in your life that you will never forget and when he's surprised or a chair and we've popped out of boxes we've done the whole gamut of things which is really fun\nBut then everybody kind of goes away and there was a huge chunk of time which can last for months to rediscover everybody again as a full family unit not just new patterns that were formed while they were gone\nSo you're you're ... you're hoping that operation reconnect helps the whole so we've we've heard a lot about how a returning service people end up sometimes with mental health issues\nThat slowly from all of it and it's not just about what happened when they were gone and might be about what happened while they were gone at home at me moving operation reconnect you're you're trying to to try to start that healing ... a ...\nI Believe the healing that operation reconnect provides is indescribable um we've had so many situations in so many stories or had a service member that lost his grandfather the week that he was supposed to come on to reconnect trip\nThe rest of his family had to take the time off of work to attend the funeral services and he decided that he was still wanted to come down to the beach he came by himself\nAnd it was the most relaxing peaceful week he'd ever had in his entire life and he said that is exactly what he needed after he lost his grandfather [noise] um so if it impacts people in so many different ways but that's\nWhat we're staying focused on is that operation reconnect doesn't provide a service whether it be marriage counseling um you know in any of that we just provide the gift of time we give you the seven uninterrupted days to do what it is to heal yourself\nWhether that's walking on the beach uh you know being on a boat or just just enjoying time with your kids in in reintegrating on those those small steps at that are needed\nAnd it don't neutral ground absolutely yes you're not having to run the soccer practice or T. ball and grocery shop and do all those everyday things that are stressful make you run around you actually just get to spend\nThat time together to really quality time somewhere else you don't need to dust or clean everything perfect you know the beaches there you just going to go have fun I really enjoy each other as a family\nIn the military members for the most part are self sufficient [laughter]\nIs not a handout to the needy but removing the barriers to entry of having the cost of the accommodations eliminated I don't know about you guys but uh three thousand dollar donation on a property is sure sure it's going to entice me to go on vacation [noise] um [noise] and again our military members it's public information\nThere's not a military member that's a that's a millionaire or they're they're not making a million dollars a year to go rent a three four five thousand dollar we've had twelve thousand dollar week houses donated to us [noise]\nSo again eliminating that barrier of the accommodations and then our partnerships with the local businesses a rental management companies are my real estate is a huge one uh they they pay for the cleaning fees for our families which reduces the burden on our organization as well that is something our organization would normally pay for\nBut because they want to be so involved there taking care of additional auxiliary cost such as cleaning season parking passes\nSo everything is taken care of everything except for the travel to the location right now we were not all inclusive they do have to get to our area [noise] uh we are working on travel we're not there yet so if if anybody's listening that owns a delta airplane\nWhere we definitely love that [laughter] but no it's it's almost all inclusive but the accommodations is the biggest barrier to people taking the time and enjoying enjoying the time together", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "year": "2018", "city":
