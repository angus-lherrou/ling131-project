mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of at all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trait\nAnd we're going to trade in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow were to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none I I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for exactly but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits and suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we need to do that if we\nTake it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not hosting the debt smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky net and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so forth and so on but he recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm\nA tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence and you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect\nGod because they know everything they see everything they they don't control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYeah I ... you\nWrite an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button that up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small but\nYou know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day ... singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\n[noise] yeah and it\nAnd I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is listen you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine so\nAfter I like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that says you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquered the yes raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely senator and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour

Can't even think of it all on my head and he's got all kinds of a criminal activities background including a previous previous bomb threat\nUm previous bomb threat I think for two thousand and two as well as drugs stuff and stealing and he's he's got he's got a long long wrap sheet\nSo the threat based on everything we know it was completely gone there is nothing there's nothing to suggest that this guy had any one assisting him there's any cell or cluster hear anyone else that his operation on his behalf this was a lone crazy in a van\nThe van which you may very well have seen already\nA

I mean he's a really pathetic human being um but ... now we're supposed to act like this guy has supporters are this guy is representative of a broader sense but on the right meanwhile do\nWe have a country of three hundred and twenty million people\nAnd now I can think of er there's one there's one person that we can associate with being a Trump supporter or who since Trump has been president\nPeople would say oh well\nYou know he's a he's a lethal threat because of his\nA wave uses his politics\nUm but now that they're going to make this you're going to hear about this for ever is never going to go where they're going to be talking about this one I mean they still talk about oh an abortion clinic bombers from like the Nineteen nineties and things like Nineteen Ninety three you'll still hear about bombing abortion clinics haven't happened and you know a very long time but that's\nAnytime you talk about terrorism and and then you also get into this whole discussion and\nI wanted to discuss this with the young Turks guy who was on my show and rising morning with junk we're now we're going to hear again you watch next week there'll be this oh right wing terrorism is really scary terrorism right wing terrorism kills more people that tends to be the\nThe headline that they lead with and I always had to point out well\nBig issue there is one do you exclude nine eleven from it\nAh that's first and foremost but then also there's a whole bunch of other things and how do you really count this\nWhat is the determining factor whether something is kind of his terrorism because with some of the federal\nStatistics that they look out for this they'll say well you know a neo Nazi got into a bar fight and stabbed someone to death Nicole ... well if the guy was a minority of those ... now is that a hate crime is murder yes\nIs it terrorism though in the way that we think of terrorism the the definition can be a little bit\nAh a little bit less obvious less clear right it's a hate crime it's murder but is it terrorism or and then you you look at the way that they constantly exclude from a from the discussion\nAnd from the statistics forwarded attacks I mean the moment that you start looking at worded attacks and you realize that radical Islam is far and away the biggest threat them yet\nYou look at the times square bomber you look at the underwear bomber frugal most of them a column I mean these are attacks would it kill hundreds of people most of the right wing terrorism at the site\nWith a couple of exceptions over the last Fifteen Years most the right wing jurors may site is single acts of violence against individuals by\nA neo Nazis or or or white nationalist again heinous evil or\nCrimes that should be punished or the full extent of the law but it's not strategic level national threat terrorism the way the radical Islamic terrorism is\nBut I'm just telling you you're going to now that we got this guy who's been captured today\nThis this uh says our fellow says are uh say rock was what I keep forgetting as I was in his last name I mean everyone remembers his first name but not not studied everyone's saying ah everyone's saying that\nYou know he's obviously so pro Trump that he's such a bad guy or say ... say opposites Iraq say are\nOr what is a we know what is\nIt is not I mean these American but what what is his parents nationality or his parents parents nationalities wondering if there's any news his first name says are the kind of unusual anyway [noise] ah\nYeah they're ... they're going to run with this though and this is where we have to deal with now this was not going away anytime soon it's ah unfortunately going to be used against us and\nI don't know if it's going to sway the midterms I really hope that uh

finished with the hour but uh and by the way Carlo piss has joined us a here along with Ron had junior from heads heating and air conditioning so uh where are we at that time of year now we're we're going to be transitioning out of the the sweat and into into foot on a sweater\nYeah we may be it's a good look cool Jill the morning and yesterday and ah I had turned my heat on at my house it didn't get cold enough and the short of a period of time to cause me to have to but I had turned the heat on in my truck driving to work\nThis is the time of year I Know um when it when it when we talk about maintenance for air conditioners when I think of that I think about it mainly in terms of making sure that I that I get the most\nFor my money because of well maintained air conditioners going to be more energy efficient it's gonna last longer a and I don't want it to break down of on a weekend or at night or something but when I think of a maintenance for this time of year uh see I use gas I think about it as terms of safety I Want to be safe\nUm uh that's important\nThat's something I Want a gas is very important\nTo have checked every year and make sure they're operating properly they're clean a 'cause a lot of times when they get dirty that's when you start having issues would produce and CEO and uh if you have some other things going\nWrong with your unit a lot of can produce CEO and you never even know is doing it high quality to kill somebody and you don't know it because you haven't had a check and it's just everything's working right so it's going out and you don't know that is going on or but all it takes is one\nThing that happens and then everybody's in trouble\nSo skip and a year of maintenance on on on on\nGas bad that I recommend that no of course if you will recommend it\nBut um but it's as you pointed out this is this is such a safety issue even if it if if it doesn't uh if if it's not the end it you can make you sick rhyme\nDeath and the and it's it's even worse the older the heater is the more\nThe you definitely don't want to skip er or why you want to get it checked out you know the year\nAnd you always wanted right now is the least turned your unit on so you know this operational whether it be a heat pump for any other uh but it's a good time just to get checked out before you hit that good cold spell and you flip that switch and go oh no I don't have any\nWhat um when when somebody calls you for maintenance uh for for this time of year what kind of things will you do\nThis depending on whether it's a gas heater for the heat pop or ... or strength electric straight electric has a list and everything else to do but on the gas heater we checked operation we look at your burners make sure everything's burning Bernard shaw clean\nNowadays we have or like a jet burner so there we don't have to clean burners as much but we have to look in your heat exchange or make sure everything's claimed you're you've got a fan now that\nWhen you meet a veteran you're meeting a hero\nWhen you donate your car to the Purple Heart foundation\nAnd most important of everything frankly is safety or anything we look at and we address for people and recommendations we make whether we do um or other people or to do those recommendations we want to make sure that everybody is safe and the process\nSo we do need to look at a bigger picture\nOr we are air conditioning folks first and foremost that's what we started out as but we realize decades ago that we have to be something a bigger than that we have to see the big picture of an entire house or or business or structure in order to figure out what's\nCorrect or incorrect about air conditioning sometimes it may be that it's doing everything it can but it's the wrong size and that leads to some problems\nAre not just under seizing but others are seizing can cause issues and there's a variety of other things that we look at we don't put our blinders on when we come to your house and because we're able to do a lot of these functions like\nCross basic calculation insulating a or do you measure of vacation and stuff we look at things in a broader away a than a company that can only do one thing if you call an answer later and say I have high power bills he's going to recommend insulating\nIt may not be the answer\nIt may not be your biggest bang for the buck but if he doesn't sell insulation\nMan he's kind of wasting his time and perhaps yours too but the bottom line is a we have more options than I think anybody in this area to help make your house better make you more comfortable and save your money in the process\nIt's I'm having watched you do the task the home performance tests um it it showed me that that a lot of what you do is is there's not a lot of guesswork I mean you really boils down to these are the facts\nAnd well let's say the scientists guess a lot less\nAh because they are better equipped with tools and diagnostic process these and logical thinking and we apply all those things\nAre sometimes a we have to kind of speculate on what the result will be and if it'll be several enough to solve it and we have to just you know throw at people hey do the whole nine yards and it's going to be this much\nInstead of saying let's take steps in the right direction and see when it finally relieves your symptoms and when you're basically in a position to say okay well now let me focus on you know the kids' soccer\nSeason or the holidays coming up or whatever because\nMost folks don't want to focus on the things that we do for them they are drawn to dealing with it because it is just a thorn in their side that they can't get rid of\nAnd we understand that and so we want to help them solve it you get beyond it get back to the things they they enjoy doing on a minute to minute basis\nYou're listening to hands heating and air conditioning\nUm and as you just heard in this segment it's way more than just heating

N. T. M. with heads heating and air conditioning [noise]\nOne hand junior and Carlos ... are here with heads\nA and we started the hour talking about getting maintenance done for a variety of reasons of course this time of year I mentioned that I think about maintenance because I've got gas or a gas heating system and I think in terms of safety\nThey don't want to make sure that I'm completely safe\nUm Carlo are important to get it done also before the first cold snap\nYes and in ... bill generally we pulled out a jacket by the time we hit Halloween and thrown at on or kind of thought about it and by the time we hit Thanksgiving\nWe will have turned on our heater to use it to take the chill off or to actually keep from getting too cold and the bottom line is it is safest to have that checked out prior to using it initially\nUh if you do and I'm procrastinating are forgetting and then you do have to use it because that cold spell came in ah of course you'll probably do so but\nStill get it checked because it's important that it's safe to operate and that's with all systems not just the gas systems\nBut the gas systems we have more concerns with for safety than the heat pumps and the straight electric systems but we recommend it for all of it it's not just for safety it's also for getting you good performance in keeping that equipment last thing and and uh extending its life\nUh so you don't have to purchase a new equipment prematurely\nSo when ... when we have our first really a below freezing few days how hectic does give\nAnd what I was fixing to talk to you say something about but uh when we get every time we get a good coach spill first glucose but we're wide open and that's one of the reason we're saying check it out early because there's\nLots of people who haven't turn there's on or they don't use like me I go without heat a lot\nRight and uh so I can I won't term on on until this is very very cold in an generally the kids were yelling at me and so then I'll go and turn the heat of the heap up all but\nWe get swamped and we can't get to everybody's fast and a lot of times when you start getting that they belong back up\nAnd uh so generally that will happen to like the first three or four good coal spells we'll get like that and then after that yeah we get a little busier but we're not swapped and uh [noise]\nBut so that's another reason why you want to check it out I haven't checked out before you get the first good cold spell and a cause that goes back what it's like that for us to like that for every body they're all getting those calls and everybody's running around trying to catch a\nAnd our service guys don't knock off at five o'clock they will work longer into the night and everything like that yes uh but there comes a point where you basically get run ragged\nAnd that's what happens to those guys and they are real troopers I have to commend them for their extra effort and everything yes but we do have to kind of a plan a little uh as homeowners and as people who want to be comfortable\nAnd take into consideration that there's only so many of those folks out there are services tax and guys\nAnd if you have something major\nThat has found like a cracked heat exchange or or some other major repair\nThat really doesn't make sense to fix it uh it takes a little longer to line up and get a replacement done or at least the next day or a couple of days depending on how many folks if like the in that predicament but the bottom line is that if you plan to head\nThat won't be done as an emergency type thing it'll be a minimum of inconvenience and\nUh it you'll get your best prices that way too\nAnd I'm just having regular maintenance done um it's also going to increase the lifespan of of all of it\nYes just like it does with your car with your body and knock at the stuff is uh if you treat it right it should last longer for you\nOkay so you can call heads heating and air conditioning and get the maintenance done to find one six five three seven eight seven three now explain how the the maintenance agreements work\nMight miss agreement should depending on how many systems you pass a certain rate and we come out twice a year will come out once and the spring or summer and and the fall some towns you know depending on when they own schedule we have a lot of people would call them and\nUh they're they're busy at that time so they'll wait till the last minute but we come up twice a year and check it out in the heat and check it out in ... and we perform or the the tests are talking about look at your outdoor unit you're further charges during the coup in season you all your electric connections and [noise]\nUh will wash the outdoor called the indoor coal if that's dirty and then that's a lesser priceless outside of it we got the price for that but\nThere's a lot of things that plus you get a ten percent discount on many parts that you need\nA and you get priority service\nThat doesn't mean that you call in and we your next go call 'cause we have a lot a lot of maintenance agreement people\nAnd uh but we try to get you the same day and we'll take you before we take somebody who if you got ... no heat we're going to do those before we do a maintenance person or two we'll try to move our stuff around trying to take care of\nOkay we've got only a a little bit more than a minute left in the show one of ... more time uh about heads heating and air conditioning is going to take\nA a trucker to to Florida with supplies for the people that

Facebook page for the fun of gay or straight Facebook paid\nBy a lot of options there were all over Facebook right now awesome [laughter] well I'm I'm honored to have Jacob butts all with us this morning I got you know hey how's it going good Jacob he uh he's our ports coordinator\nHe has a very very important position or armies unlimited uh without Jake or we would have a hard time finding the parts that we need to repair the RVs that we service for\nAre the ones that we still of course the ones that we service for customers we ever an amazing service department or an amazing staff of people that managed that unsupervised that and it's just our customers with their needs and\nJacob is a key component of that department and uh I'd like Jacob to maybe described to us a little bit about his process and what he does it already is unlimited in assisting or our technicians and our service Reuters and our customers are with their parts needs\nTook us an example of um like if somebody needed apart what you would yeah\nOkay so the process is very simple um\nSo the customer comes the parts coordinators are with concerned about their part of ... of course it goes for our service riders they're going to ride the customers verbatim\nFor what's going wrong with her unit of course our technicians are then going to you [noise] ah overview or their report that they made about their unit the shoes so let's just say they have the\nLeak and their bathroom [noise] okay that's that would be a huge problem of course you know um [noise]\nSo they're going to tell the service writers service dryers are going to take down that information and I'm\nDispatch the work orders or what they call we call him a to our technicians so our technicians around polls their unit into their bay overview the shoe fine now um what the issue is right up how we're going to correct it and what parts are needed\nThey then come to me with the parts for quest we order the part when it comes in I receive it\nI take it back to our storage building and I also put in the computer so that the technician technicians can see on the paperwork that those parts have arrived in that they are\nPerforming to work on the customers unit\nSo they're trying to get it to the customer in a timely manner as possible so that they can get that link the bathroom or whatever it is\nIt's actually kind of at a two fold sort of a thing because you've got the house part of it the living part of the army and then you've got the automotive part of the army said that's a lot of parks that you're having to find\nThat is correct um so let's just say your water heater goes out you have a lot of components in your water heater so that is why we have the technicians there they're not just run the middle people off the streets it's people who know exactly how that water heater works there going\nIt apart and tests individually the parts of it the components of it so they know exactly what the issue\nIs because you might miss just need a small part of the water heater you might not need to replace the whole thing\nCorrect why replace the whole thing when you can replace a small part you don't throw away car windows higher pops you go get a new tire well\nSome places you would take it and then they tell us your water heater go get a new one because that's easier\nCorrect that that is how some places operate a but this is where your home that we're talking about you know a RVs unlimited we we do believe that we sell homes now just RVs\nSay you want to take care of people in their homes and get them back and living in their homes the way they the way they want it to the way they intended to 'em now you also when you're looking for part ... you're trying to find the best deal on a part to\nCorrect um because [noise]\nI mean our customers are all from all walks of life or some of them can afford to get four new tires put on their car some can afford to get a gently used tire only one of them on their car so of course uh with money in mind\nIf you're going to buy an RV nine times out then you've got a family um\nSo that tells me\nFinancially it can be a little type because I have family myself a so RVs to me\nThere I guess you could say the new age homes yeah a mobile homes or time to go now style Harvey's really coming into style because uh you can move with them yes you can go\nAround the United states with them the whatever you want with them and that's definitely something that is appealing to a lot of people\nAnd says so when you're looking for a party you give people options you can get you know a new part or you can find and I'm a gentle use refurbished part are you at least given the option of hey we had this available here's here's what you can can choose from\nCorrect and the final say so is of course always up to the customer\nI'm impressed with your service department and your parts department and I can you describe it's been a while since we've talked about how big your service department as Jeremy can you give people a visual idea on the radio [laughter]\nHow big they said it's not just like oh we got one day let's put you in and you'll have to wait three days for the next shot\nWell we we actually have um we have two buildings\nIt's surely nothing to it you know you just got to take a leap and and you realize it's not that bad\nAnd you guys will help people find the RV that meant that meet their needs back\nWhen when a customer comes on to the lauded armies unlimited marry you know we're not we don't see that customers a dollar bill\nWe see the opportunity to serve someone\nWe want to find out what your needs or we want to find out about your your desires of what you're going to do with your vision you or your family going to go with you is just going to be you know what is it that you're looking for what's going to best meet your needs\nAnd we're going to guide you in direct you and and show you know if you want something that's built a little better maybe than than one ... will tell you about how it's built was built with and\nHow long we expected to last compared to ... you know obviously in anything in life you get what you pay for\nI mean quality costs more and so you know will help guide you in theory you and and help you make a good decision when you've got a sale going on right now\nWe do all the Sean talk about that\nYeah we all fail or false sales so fall into our our special savings hair [noise]\nUm but we have a false sales going on and we have a lot of selected products out there that are discounted to fit just about anybody needs a we've got some special financing needs so we've got a zero down\nAnd no payments for Ninety day program nice yeah so it's a really affordable now a ... so come on down and take a look I'm you will be met with a a nice sales staff um like Jeremy said they're going to find out your watch and your needs [noise]\nUm but we have a

going to try to sell you something like\nYou typically get at some places you feel like you're just being sold these guys are truly there to serve you to help meet your needs and help you get a quality product and you feel good about what you're buying and you're spending your money on and you're a you're happy with it when you get home and you're like man that I made the right decision you'll know before you leave\nAnd you know we talked about earlier in the program you have just gone to the up and half and you've got some new ones that you are going to be making available including Jeremy's favorite to ...\nTo try to ... the the new edition we have lots of them um that are there now already from our selection and then we have a few more that are that are in route and they're

really need make sure that you're you're doing it in a in a manner that\nGuarantees all those things and we can do that inside certain structures that no matter what happens in the market no matter what happens in the political arena or whatever might occur worldwide we can set up plans\nAnd we do it every day to make sure you're are you we have all the holes field and there's not a gap and they're like you know talking about off the air [noise] we're in a in our planning we make sure that you've got the right liability insurance for your car and homeowners people just don't pay attention to those type things\nBut in this in this world we live and if you do something wrong\nSomebody's going to see right and and especially if they find out you've won the lottery especially if you want to monitor that try and and you know but if you've got any money to certain ways to protect certain assets so that if you are saying they take everything there are certain things I Can't take take if it is\nPositioned correctly and the different buckets that we we set up that's important\nAnd and I'm sure that a lot of this also involves tax strategy because I'm I'm I'm guessing or the federal government the state governments every government once a part of that yes whether it's\nA lottery or an inheritance or\nA a pension payout that's right you got to make sure that the taxes you know once you send money to Washington or Montgomery you usually not going to get it back\nRight you know is just ... if you've been fortunate enough to not be on the government do so to speak you're not going to get it back\nSo we need to make sure we're doing things correctly so that if you do take I'd lump sum of your pension than it is moved directly from the pension directly to an hour right and that's a non taxable and men\nYou're only going to pay taxes when you start taking an income and ah that's just very important and they're always certain strategies like you've started talking about with a certain trust that can greatly or eliminate greatly reduce or eliminate your tax liability so\nThere are ways to to coat mingle certain techniques and ideas and\nBuckets so that we're you know paying our fair share to Uncle Sam but not somebody else or share to you know that's just not fun\nAnd you're absolutely right about that are so as a as a financial planner\nOr one that's been doing it for as many years is you have when you see these lotteries happen in the ... it's on the news every day for two weeks oh yeah does it get on your nerves at all do you think it's because it does me I it it just all the interviews with people standing in line and talking about all the money to throw it at these lottery tickets\nI just wonder it just doesn't make sense now I'm not going to say that I was in Montana last week\nWith a group of friends and we go out every year\nAnd Montana participates in the lottery so we said look there are nine of us let's go by ten tickets will will split you know that like you see all these people splitting up you know we can split no one point six billion then that's nine way that's still pretty good little deal but it sounds like you're thrown at a dollar age what what'd you\nTwo dollars each ... dollars age and I'm and I'm I'm I get these people are on the news that are all talking about throwing in twenty bucks thirty bucks whole\nPaycheck in they'll cash a paycheck and go spend their whole paycheck\nAt the detriment of the landlord who they're renting from or fate and the kids I mean it's it's not good but you know\nA look people people are grown up they need to make decisions for themselves a it is kind of strange that Alabama is one of only I think eight seven or eight states where one of six and we're about to

do\nThey for them or I just had to call when we were off the air from somebody who's listening said that the uh uh for ... twenty eight so twenty eight thousand tickets the day before the the drawing twenty eight thousand tickets\nWell that's what fifty six thousand dollars that they brought in to those at that one little play yes so you think about that's in forty six states you know that's how they get to one point six billion dollars\nWell Louisiana uh they they revealed to their most profitable lottery ticket sales locations are along the Mississippi border surely are where the Mississippians go there to buy the lottery ticket yeah\nSo that will change when Mississippi Institute's their lottery yeah Mississippi's most profitable locations are going to be on the Alabama border sure they are right there at the rest area Rob soon as you get into the to the state\nIt's a and you think about some place like for example there's nobody that lives there [laughter] there's two thousand tickets in one day yes [laughter]\nUh we're we're moving on from that or we're going to talk about the topic of Social Security\nNow Tucker Carlson is somebody we're going to hear from in this segment now he's the guy that you may watch on Fox he he replaced Bill O'Reilly on Fox News he's got his nightly show he's got a book out called ship of ... and I have heard that it's a pretty good book\nNow the idea is our politicians care more about their own agendas than they do about the voter and according to Tucker Carlson that's when the voters fought back and elected Trump is saying that that was one of the reasons that Trump was able to win now uh you got a chance to see Tucker Carlson right he spoke to one of your industry groups\nYeah one of our small groups that uh you know I get to sit down with Sean Hannity couple of years ago and\nAnd Tucker Carlson and just listen to people talk about because they have their finger on the pulse right the swamp right you know and that's what Tucker is talking about the one of the big raises Donald Trump one is that they were tired of the smoke tired of the politicians doing stuff that was in their best interest rather than the best interest of their constituents and he also went in great depth about Social Security\nHe talked about pension plans Ben and Social Security and and those type so let's listen to what he had so Kay\n\nSocial Security is seen as sacrosanct obviously has been mismanaged and surpluses evaporated et cetera and it's it's been consistently misused over decades however there is a broad understanding between the parties\nThat it will be bailed out if necessary inevitably will be because one it's a secret promise and to um the people who benefit from it are the most reliable voters in the country so I think Social Security is find the pension question as a much more complex one\nBut I think I mean you certainly seen people get ... on our pensions before for sure\nNot I'm not I'm not but in your industry so I don't I don't consider this every day the way you do but I but I I Would tend to agree with the Tucker Carlson did anybody any political figure that messes with Social Security is going to regret it that way yeah regret enormously but\n[noise] uh you look at how we handle finances in Washington John McNeil so when when your clients come in and talk to you about this what do you say to them on how much they should count on Social Security\nIt depends on their age uncle Henry so when we sit down with a husband and wife for example and they're in their forties\nOkay no obligation so again that's to find one six six six five thousand to five one six six six five thousand\nFor any of those books you heard John McNeil mentioned including ship a fool's\nBy Tucker

I don't I'm not going to need that much income you know at age I'd rather have more income now than at age between eight Seventy and eighty when they tell me I have to take all this money [noise] uh\nRight now we're in a position because of the Trump's tax plan where we all get a ... ... ... a sale most everybody is in a lower tax bracket right now will be the next six years then sunsets and we go back to the higher taxes unless they do something about it\nSo right now it is not a bad idea to take a little more income from your RA four O. one K. and take less money from your brokerage account or your savings accounts and those type things let's take some more taxable income we show you this on your road map\nYou can you know if you're getting X amount of income from all these different sources including Social Security we can take a a little more income from your IRA right now without moving you up into the next income tax bracket\nSo why do we go in and spend some this takes more money draw some of that taxable income out now if we're not going to use it or spend it or blow it or will buy lottery tickets with what I Would do is reinvest it into another account\nThat we can draw on later when probably and I use the word probably probably we're going to be in higher tax brackets\nBecause you've heard the news while we were you you were reading something tummy outlined online about over half the people\nAre drawing more welfare benefits than they are paying impacts the headline\nIs over half of America gets more and welfare than they pay in taxes over half\nOf the population so how long can we sustain that system what's gonna have to have my I don't care if they're Democrats or Republicans in in uh in Washington they're going to probably have to raise taxes uh unless the economy is booming like it is but that's cyclical\nUh so we know what tax brackets ran right now we know that they're historically low right now so if it's if the hooves you tax wise and strategy was moving forward for the next thirty forty years many of the life expectancy\nOr let's go ahead and take a little bit more taxable income now pay less tax on it then we may have to six eight ten years from now when we were forced to take an amount of money out of the plan so by taking it now our account balance is in the four oh one K. R. I. a buckets\nThey will be lower because we're drawing money out they will be lower so that when we do turn Seventy we or even if you have to send me we can go ahead and start reducing that now\nA then you're not dictated on how much you have to take out and that may coincide with our tax brackets so it's it's definitely worth looking out at looking at a Maria Bruno writes write a great blog follow her you know she has some some terrific ideas and we've been as many her ideas for a number of years now\nWell a whiff somebody retires of full retirement at age sixty five\nAnd a let's say it's a lady that's going to live until she's Ninety five right um the tax laws could change numerous times during the ... that long retirement they will not they could they wheelchair so I'm going to guess that the retirement road map that you put together it gets a changed now every time something like\nThat pops up oh yeah he just changed it gets changed even more not just led about changes in tax laws and whatnot it changes with a family events you know the death of a spouse or inheritance of a parent you know those type things we changed the road map and that's why we design or a mass to be very flexible\nUh we know that a lot of people\nBecause real estate markets done very well a lot of retirees are downsizing right now selling their houses for real good money", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "year": "2018", "city": "Mobile", "day": "27"}
