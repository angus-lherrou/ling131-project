{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "Thanks so much for listening to morning with Kelly Bennett and uncle Henry where our news talk for nine ... seats and these radio ... pm and Ninety nine five as the jak in mobiles\nRevenues headlines coming up in about ten minutes from Fox and from NBC Fifteen or in other\nNews sources here on the Gulf Coast mornings before we get your news headlines we want to welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings Michael Bauer NBC News radio national correspondent Michael good morning\nGood morning or good morning Kelly Abby Monday\nYeah I Know you you too I Know President Trump was on sixty minutes last night if we have time we'd like to get to that but I'm curious about complaints about FEMA and hurricane Michael Kelly minute and I have been through several hurricanes here on the Gulf Coast and I think people tend to always have complained about FEMA\n[laughter] I I think there's actually wallets unwritten for the most part guys I think there's rules that even FEMA abides by what they know that\nX amount of days into a calendar after a hurricane is drug that is one of the complaints are going to be I think they have that kind of clarity as well so I don't think this is unexpected but I Do think there's a certain part of this\n... when you have the storm the size of hurricane Michael ... grew as it impacted the Florida Panhandle and exactly what it did to the Florida Panhandle I think now we're starting to see some elements of a little bit more concern in regards to FEMA's abilities and and what they are and are not doing so\nIn some cases where Singh reports over the weekend journalists have been out speaking with people in Panama City speaking with people in Mexico beach and I have found in regards as an example one story barber Sanders hunkering down with her daughter in an apartment in Panama City\nThat apartment complex badly damaged but Sanders told reporters not a single relief agency has come by to check on them not one group of organs or organization has come by to check on them and all that so they're not getting any help they need food and water it's just crazy now\nNot to say that they didn't prepare or not have X amount of days of food water on hand but again this storm\nA much stronger when it hit land than most people were expecting certainly than they would have had time to prepare for two days in advance so um they're out of water now they're out of food and they're looking for help and there are no FEMA trucks making their way around dropping off any food or water so abrupt long administrator for FEMA\nOr out of a statement yesterday saying that the system is working their system is working but it takes time when you see devastation like that\nAnd he said we have to set all the citizens expectations saying that they have twenty three distribution points\nWhere residents can get food water and other essential but it seems guys that probably one of the bigger problems here because Michael was so strong when it came in and did so much destruction certainly any areas still without electricity and at best spotty cell service\nThe information is not getting to the people who need it the most right now they are not getting the information of these twenty three different places where you could go and get food and water\nNor do they necessarily have a car that may have been washed away with the flooding that went on to be able to get them to one of these twenty three distribution centers and in the case of the woman I was speaking of earlier missed centers um she said the only way that they were able to get water was there was a a group of people a truckload of people are from Louisiana that happened to pack a bunch of water in the waters of bottles\nOf water in the back of their Ford F. one fifty and we're driving around looking for people dropping off water that way and the question then is why isn't FEMA doing something like that\nOkay well this is um I as we started the conversation I'm Kelly but you're not surprised or you I mean this is this is ... after every storm like this there are criticisms of FEMA\nYeah and I think it's unfortunate but with the cell towers down in power down I think you're going to see this kind of situation exactly\nAs Michael our explains you know people that just aren't aware of where to go to get it or that there may be help close by they're just not even aware\nAnd you know female even admitted look you know there are some areas where we we just we're having trouble getting in there right now it's going to take some time they were talking about food drops this morning\nSo I'm a ... it's it's a rough situation for everybody involved in this thing I you know like you said it got strong so fast\nAnd it's a situation where a few days that hurricane supplies is gonna run out on you yeah if you're in a really hard hit areas\nAnd that seems to be you know as as as you mentioned there you know you've had more than a few ... saying that again\nAccessibility to these to these cities to these neighborhoods seems to be the biggest challenge so far because of of debris and and and rode roads are literally crumbling on those kinds of issues and safety getting people to that area which is why as you also mentioned according to governor Rick Scott they were going to start deploying some air dropping of food and water\nAnd some of the hardest hit areas but that still kind of this information not being able to be exchanged between FEMA and the people who don't have power electricity that should be something that you would think\nOn any normal level any hurricane well there was a category one or a category five they'd be able to remedy that on some level how do they get that information out to the people that should be one of the more important things that they're doing in these communities are they're going to visit and if you have people who can't get there because their cars were washed away\nThen how do you get that food and water that you've been preparing and talking about your preparation for\nHow you get that to them before it's either too late or in the case of what some of these people are saying is listen you're going to have residents in the area where people from Louisiana helping and bringing food and water until FEMA can get in there and then the ... going to take all of the all of the pluses and thumbs up for doing this fantastic ... even though they weren't there for a majority of the time\nAnd we're out of time here didn't have time to get to President Trump on sixty minutes Michael ... thank you for your time this morning you got to have a great rest of your morning\nTheir egos of our NBC News radio national correspondent ... aren't we told that before hurricanes we should have at least three days of food and water that's yeah and and\nYou know you do the best you can and ... and I think it was just such a monster storm\nYeah nobody's going to be happy with the recovery effort [noise]\nWe have news headlines coming up next to you for listening to Gulf Coast mornings\n[noise]\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute

I never expected Cooper riverside park would be such a great venue to do something but when it's not Ninety five degrees ... that's a great venue\nOh yeah we had that and it's kind of like you eat prey to the ... guys out there you know you need your good weather and and the right number of people to come and the right people to come together to make the event happen and it really happened for us last year\nSo he's been thankful that we've gotten to have a lot of the same people returning returning partners international wine with with us last year they're coming back this year and same with Land Rover\nHuge project a couple of different people and um where an absolutely anticipating a you know an even bigger and better and that next year\nAgain that's one on the river immobile dot com to go get tickets in Rebecca what does your ticket get you\n[noise] so it gets even the gate it get you on you will receive a souvenir wine glass and that you get to take around and I mean it made him glass so it's not just a little plastic cup it's an experience as a part of that where you get some you know it's over two hundred different types I Want to say I counted the left it was pretty ...\nExtremely expensive so there's something there for everybody\nYeah and you get a passport booklet that are the same as around the world said there's winds and\nBears from a little bit of everywhere there's some that are more semi regional like Pensacola something out of Birmingham too um but then winds is I mean as far as the ... you really want to go away um to try different type of wine and so as you come in and you get the glass you get the same playing on\nPassport booklet thinking mark off your favorites remember to buy him at the store trying to restaurant in town we're going to have some food vendors as well we have on some really great the vendors this year um and now we're testing my memory if I can remember all of them\nWell we have we have plenty of Ender's cottage at least there today so yeah I'm a little everything\nYou can find out at one of the river immobile dot com so tell us a little bit more I Know you're going to have a lot of ones there and you can't talk about all of them are are are there some want to point out now that we should have our our eye out for\nA man that that are so many different styles that are going to be there um but yes there's actually some some fun winds that I think for some people that might not be serious wine drinkers or beer drinkers\nWe've got a few recall kind of like cocktail Spitzer's there's a handful um they are going to be in camp packaging like Ramona\nIt's a it's a sparkling white wine with a little bit of grapefruit juice and they're just a little bit of residual sugar still very easy to drink and not a sugar bomb 'em but some unique style packaging and cans and we've got some Spitzer's at a really popular over in Europe right now\nSo I think we've got about three or four different styles of of those little wind Spitzer's I'm Better than that or a blast um but then really we got Washington state represented Oregon\nUm you know California as well I'm One of my favorite little producers out of a France some in particular burgundy's out there be show so we'll be showcasing some of the ... and ... and ... days of from that particular producer\nNow it's called one on the river is they're going to be anything else to drink other than one\nYet so we got some said so we got some beers at it like she was saying that can be represented locally from Pensacola Bay brewery I'm obviously over in Pensacola and from red hills I'm up in Birmingham and then we got a few other ones um mattered in between there and then like I said that we've also got those\nSparkling kind of cocktail drinks that are unique in social is another one which is a rice based Psaki an alcohol was all organic USDA certified um that's just a unique kind of mixture as well to to keep people interested because not everybody's gonna enjoy the wind and the beer obviously going to enjoy the park\nSo we wanted to throw in a few other things just in case you're answer your grandma your husband\nIsn't super high on those things they'll have a few things to sneak away and and try for themselves\nNow some listeners may never have gone to a wind event or wine tasting is there any special etiquette they should know about\nActually it's it's funny you say that yes there is some fancy etiquette which\nSometimes you get really fancy wine tastings you know try to keep the cologne and the perfume to a minimum\nBecause as the person next to you is trying to you know sit there and wine and smell the air um addicts if that person next to you has a lot of cologne or you know perfume on them you'll smell Chanel number five instead of the the blackberry under tones to the cabernet um\nSo if I wanted to I could stop people if I detect an axe body spray\nEvacuate you're given to actually have waited\nFor years I have a legitimate reason to stop people from wearing acts bodies burning so um what about ... I'm sure that that's one of the things people ask you every day of your life is food paradox with one can you give us some basic just some basic education on that\nYeah so some basic things remembers you know with with food pairing is you know red wines always go with red meats and white wines generally go you know with with white needs you know but that's very basic but when you started expanding from there I think one of the key ingredients as your company and who you're drinking you're wine with\nBecause you can have a nice bottle of wine and the nicest you know slap cheese but if you're by yourself sitting in the corner eating and drinking it it's just not quite as special to be able to enjoy that with your friends and family you know in in loved ones\nThen you take the combination of what's the setting you know from being outside being with your friends there's really no rules that if you're spending your own money you know on a ticket to come to an event or spending your own money on food and wine if you enjoy it\nThen that's your perfect pairing but the only way to ever find that out is to get it get out there stick their neck out there and try new things try a new wine with you know chicken ... or try this new cheese with you know ... with this red wine so it's all about experiment in it and having fun\n[noise] okay so this is a had did you learn anything from last year Rebecca [noise] over here on and really\nJust hit the nail on the head about as as far as what I learned last year was ... you can be them as novice wind drinker or someone who had been drinking wine for years in the media that said that and that you have the opportunity\nAny Q safely sample as many as you want really you know you can try and see it as a variety of wind that you've never tried before and you might not want to spend the money at the store to buy a whole bottle but you get to learn from things and that's what's right with working with the guys\nIs that on one of our biggest questions last year was we just fell in love with this where can I get it\nAnd I essentially you find that wind section of your local store your grocery store your places like red or white and they can get it for you yeah\nAnd actually I wanted to expand on one thing really quickly when she said safely so when we do do tastings like this they're called ... and not drinking so obviously you can drink the wine\nBut a lot of professionals and too if you don't have a list or a designated driver there are spitting buckets there says you try the one you can switch it around in your mouth and then spit it out because if you were to take one hundred or you know two hundred one out samples\nIt'd be drinking probably six seven bottles of wine so I started my people as a tasty and and and not drinking\nYeah this is a this is one of those things where you have to really ... you know pick your spots correct you have to pick your spots because there's going to be so many there\nUm what else ... you talked about the ones that Alabama likes are there any uh differences geographically from one part of the state of the other as to what type of ones we live\nI mean yes but I think you have to look even more for the ... the micro climates within the state so as far as a southern state like Alabama compared to a state like Michigan is obviously even no mission in gets warm in the summer we get much hotter in the summer for a longer duration down here so crisp white\nWines at a refreshing tend to sell a little bit more down here so whether it's a ... or whether you know what the results are some shark named styles you know do really well in the summertime that you don't really want to drink a big bold cabernet or ... you know by the pool or out on your boat in the middle of summer\nAnd reverse you know thing as well we don't get as cold here in the winter is a lot of other states as well too so regional whether differences can play you know a a pretty big impact on the style winds that are that are consumed during the those those time frames\nO the F ... ... ... what can you tell me about that have type is amazing it's a true iconic when you think of a jaguar to door to cedar and it's available in different engines you can do it for six or eight cylinder\nUm it has that great race car look to it okay\nSounds like you're kind of car I'll go and run [laughter] I Wonder if my wife would have been different if I'd gotten one of these things years\nAgo where would I be and who would I be [laughter] so I've been in a drag war twenty five years ago\nYou would definitely be an an elite club that's for sure\n[laughter] I don't know understand that Land Rover and jaguar or or sponsors not just being tired of it but also be tailgate\nCorrect jaguar is actually the tailgate sponsor and we're going to have a wonderful vehicles over there just to kind of show and highlight you know the great issue can be behind it um jaguars built all around performance but you know what you don't have to sacrifice performance in order to have more room in your vehicle so\nYou know a great and tailgating whether going to have the back of it and show it off\nYeah they'll Rebecca ... with the tailgate is well\nSo it really comes from the reality of it is football season um he ... absolutely in the south and it's a Saturday and we're not even going to pretend like we are trying to compete with that that's not what we're trying to do so we're integrating the two together and say we will be having you know there's all the games that you're wanting to watch Saturday afternoon and evening\nThat would be Alabama Tennessee\nCorrect and so on and there's a little finesse there but right around half time is right around where one on the river as starting during the Alabama game so for these people trying to decide Alabama or wine watched the first half at your house come on down and then finish the rest with us\nHave some wine and beer and some good food and um socialized a little bit\nThis is going to work out good no last year we did one on the river when Alabama was was headed by which they were all\nThis year it's the Tennessee game mhm so you watch Alabama score probably about forty five fifty point yet and then at halftime or after they've scored forty five or fifty then you can go to one on the river and and watch you\nKnow just to the conclusion with one another forty five or fifty yeah [laughter]\nBut we have\nSome great and we think about a tailgate there's tailgate games from corn Holt and jump out gene guy will have some seeing around there and the tailgate actually positioned a\nSomewhat near our beer garden area which is sponsored by Roberts brothers and so we have an entire craft beer area set up this year so a guys and gals he loved the football love craft beer that's more of your scene there is absolutely a whole place it white on the river for you this year\nOkay so uh before we go to break we're going to have some news headlines from some whether a Land Rover and jaguar tell us again some of the things we're going to be able to see from Land Rover and drug war there one of the river\nYou are going to see
