{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "News headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines would want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings Michael Bauer NBC News radio national correspondent Michael good morning\nGood morning or good morning Kelly unhappy ones they to you both\nThat'd be Wednesday and so on I was quite shocked yesterday when I was hearing the news that\nThe FBI investigation could be over today or tomorrow is that right\nYeah there was even talk I could've been done as of yesterday to the wall Street Journal officially reported that although the FBI had until friday to complete the investigation both GOP eight and a person with the matter expected to wrap up\nWill beforehand so that means it could be today it could be tomorrow it gets to travel and it tomorrow on some level but neither case certainly giving the timeframe for Mitch McConnell to get his friday vote in while still having time to review the FBI Files and documents regardless investigation clearly fits into that pencil then time for it right out now\nThat said the FBI investigation according to lawyers for Dr Blass before and Deborah marriage should be in question they both independently ... groups complained independently yesterday that the FBI was not pursuing important leads we know\nA doctor bloody Ford has not yet been interviewed by the FBI nor have the witnesses that they identified as being at the party when this whole legit sexual assault took place are those people that they thought could corroborate their story had not been interviewed by the FBI either according to these lawyers so they both on\nCompletely independent of each other wrote letters to the FBI and the chief counsel to let them know that they thought that this investigation was in question\nSo so then then where do we go from here I mean as I Know people are going to complain that the FBI investigation is over early and that certain people weren't talked about a ... do you think this the the FBI will be told to try again or is it all going to be done\nI I Can't fathom them I Can't fathom anybody agreeing to go back to the drawing board or get back to picking this up and continuing your investigation I Can't fathom that having especially when Mitch McConnell is so dead set on having this vote on friday but\nI Will say this a half of the up yet to defend them at all but what we're hearing in regards to this FBI investigation is that this has become sort of an all hands on deck element to this investigation\nAre sending in a everybody from a brand new newbies and the FBI to conduct investigations and get some information to the seasoned veterans who are very familiar with interviewing people to come off of cases in order to sit down with people involved in this particular case so it's very possible that this could be an expedient element to this because of\nThe manpower that they're putting into it I guess that's been going to weigh on whatever it is Jeff Flake a Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski are all the and the two red state Democrats who were kind of all up in the air\nI think if they don't see what they consider to be a full investigation like you don't actually go back and talk to Christine Blasey Ford at some point I don't know you can call this a complete investigation and that's going to throw their votes and the question\n\nSo [noise] what about ... what about like his he already told us that he's not going to vote that he thinks the capitals to political so is he going to be an automatic no\nThat's a really good question and I I feel like that game has been up to a little bit from uh the based upon what\nPresident Trump did yesterday and his rally where he was kind of mocking Christine Blasey Ford I think that there was an element of Jeff Flake kind of stepping up his game and say listen I mean I I don't know how right now Lisa Murkowski Susan calls are going to go back and face any of their women voters on any level of going into the midterms or anything else\nWhen you have to try to defend what the president did last night which is on the heels of the president saying that he thought I'm a Christine Blasey Ford was a credible witness so there's\nThat element to this but Jeff Flake now kind of stepping up his game and saying with all of these questions with the stories that\nHave been breaking about his drinking after after a judge Kavanaugh has sort of vehemently defended his drinking we don't know I can tell you if if he's had another drinks to get blackout drunk we do know that there was a letter coming out today in the New York times from Nineteen eighty three\nIn which judge Kavanaugh refers to he and his buddies he and his friends who are all going to a beach week as obnoxious drunks with prolific ... among us now\nI don't know if that's enough the blackout drunk\nBut in my past opinion it would certainly do that in my past experience it would certainly do that uh but he also signed that letter with five apps which we've talked about in regards to what the testimony was and the word part\nRather than Brett and we also know bart Kavanaugh was a character that one of his friends and put into a book Brett Kavanaugh was asked if that was based upon him he said he didn't know you'd have to ask the journal those are the writer well he signed this bar Kevin all we know that this is judge Kavanaugh wrote this letter wasn't somebody else so\nThere are questions that Jeff Flake just has about this guy that I think could sway his vote\nThis are just hearing your last explanation just makes me wonder who's going to play all these people in the movie\nI Can't wait to see I mean I think right off the bat if you had Matt Damon from Saturday Night live playing Brett Kavanaugh that would work and I think Brett Kavanaugh will be happy with that too All right so\nI I probably ask you this before I'll ask you again\nWhat is this going to over one way or the other just one way or the other\nView I feel like and again we all know how these things shift write a letter from day to day things could change I Would say I would expect by friday night for this but I think we head into the weekend having at least some idea of this thing being wrapped up whether or not we know it ... and I got the votes to become the next Supreme Court justice\nI don't know but I think we're certainly a step closer so I think\nWe starting next week not even caring about this any more moving on to something else\nAll right Michael ... thank you for your time today\nOn the Gulf Coast ... we have more coming up we have news headlines next\n[noise]\n\nThe boom\nThis is a Bloomberg Markets minute stumps or higher in

[noise]\nSuper ... senators do not like what President Trump did last night I'm Dave Anthony Fox News at a rally in Mississippi he mocked Brett Kavanaugh's first accuser poking fun at Christine Blasey Ford's hazy recollection of some of the events the night she claims the Supreme Court nominee tried to rape or\nThat they even touch on that point you just said as huge as I'm sure everybody had to\nHad to call some large company at some time and ah it can be quite frustrating actually have to\nSet a portion of your day aside just because you know it's gonna be that way so at least if us you can call one number you talk to that person and we try to get taken care for you right then okay that's a huge plus for me [laughter] his for me as well\nThey'll know what are the differences in the way you you were your philosophy toward contracts because I understand that a lot of the other people in your industry sometimes they have these really long contracts a lot of times people don't understand what they're signing up for\nWe we do we have short term agreements 'em\nAnd part of our thinking behind that as well with if we can make you or if you're happy customer and\nYou know we don't go up on your monitoring we keep your right to same we feel like there's no need to to for someone to for someone in to a long term agreement that to us that's kind of\nAlmost like you're telling semi or you know this long term agreement is we want you in here and\nYou're hearing your here this long and we know after this time you're gone wrong and we don't want to think about it\nThat way right yeah you are you have the almost an opposite approach that you're you're ... you're really making sure that people want to stick with you and that's because you don't change my rate I signed up a couple of years ago with you you told me that rates are going to go up as long as I'm a customer\nIt it it is correct\nOn the last I add some some new technology if I add something that's that I don't have that could change it but if I don't if I just keep it the way it is I don't have to pay more in the years to come\nIn and it it it helps us too because if it does come to a point and say at customer does want to leave for some reason we can feel good about it that we know\nIt's not us and it wasn't anything like that that drove them off and you know some things certain people do you just can't change and it's a lot easier to move pass at that point\nNow can you if somebody has some other companies system are and they're at the end of a contract can you use that same equipment is is it a is that a simple process to transfer from one company two years\nUm most of the stuff out there we can use easily the stuff that are\nMaybe somewhat of an obstacle is uh for the most part maybe antiquated equipment and we need to get them something new or any way that it's probably not going to work with maybe the modern stuff they might want to do any how\nSome people may not want to use the old equipment but if they do I would say nine out of ten times were able to\nTo ... is very it's we're in and out within an hour I'm just very simple uh normally we would just take over exactly what you have a we just send a Senate term monitoring station and or if there's any and all and you want to change we do it at that\nPoint as well in in a lot of times with the older equipment\nSome some some customers think that hey you know I've got this old equipment I Want to do to do all these things and they think that right away I've got to replace everything well\nThere's some some of the things that they may want to do we make can achieve that even with the older equipment we may have to add a little bit more up to date technology to that system that we make and make some of those things happen with what's in place\nWhere it's so so a lot of the differences are that your contracts are shorter than a lot of your competitors\nLike less ... shorter agreement\nAnd and the the price the monitoring rate is not going to go up at all as long as I keep the same equipment and don't add on new technologies\nUm and most of the time they will save money with us actually OK radial even lower okay\nThat's a ... irate generally a fraction of what a national company would charge and for us to come out and look at your system take it over there is no charge for that\nLike a mark was saying the only charge would be if you want to add some additional stuff at that point but basically you can have us come out take your system over for a charge me the first months monitoring ah you're going to have a lower agreement short term agreement and\nYou're better off every way\nAnd you get ill or someone locally\nAnd um I didn't realize this until I signed up with you that I get a little bit of this kennel my homeowner's insurance because of monitored security\nDoes correct it uh it it help they [noise] they they have figured where someone with the security system is being monitored a police fire paramedic come out than it saves them in any a potential losses they may have on the insurance side so they passed that savings on to the homeowner\nI'm not I'm not going to say I'm thrilled with my phone ring um texting thirty pounds a day with service issues yes I Would much prefer the customers do call my office so we can efficiently take care of them but I Want to bring the point that\nHow many national companies can you text the local guys say I got an issue can you get this taken care of for me well you know that's that's another big I added value because typically if you deal with the national company you're going to be calling on one eight hundred number and I think they love the convenience of the fact that they can do that\nReally easy yeah that's a that is a big big plus ... you know where you you know where the company is and you know that their local people there and you can deal with them\nWe're going to take a quick break and we're going
