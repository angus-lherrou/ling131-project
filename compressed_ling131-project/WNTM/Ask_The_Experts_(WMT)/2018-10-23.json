{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "You're listening to the Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly Bennett and uncle Henry on news talk one oh four nine W. B. B. in Biloxi\nNews radio some tangible un team and Ninety nine five FM the dragon Moby\nA we have news headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get there we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings Michael barrier BC news radio national correspondent Michael good morning\nGood morning or good morning Kelly happy to say to you both\nSo so what has happened since we last talked to you yesterday about this this uh because there's something every day on this this journalist story\nI Do feel like there is also part of that where you it sounded like it was a soap opera start ... since we last left you yeah um yeah yeah I mean we we\nAre literally the place where there were some announcements yesterday by Turkish politician that can show his body was found in a well\nNear the Saudi constantly ... and then we were going to hear today president or the one in front of parliament there in Turkey describe the naked truth what happened in great detail in regards to the death of ...\nOnly we didn't get that from or to want the day we didn't get that he just really added new rhetoric to the scandal he did accuse the Saudi Government a premeditated political murder\nBut did he offer any evidence to that or anything else in regards to the death of the show he no he offered the timeline that was one little bit of a piece of the story that I hadn't heard before that I thought was interesting which is where he said the uh the Fifteen\nMember group that flew over from Saudi Arabia that a\n... killed because Yogi according to what the Turkish officials are found a portion of that group on October second went in removed the hard disks of the security cameras from within the consulate but aside from that there was no other evidence was and again that wasn't evidence offered up that's just a statement\nBy president Earl on so we didn't really hear anything except for sort of threats and\nHis call on Saudi Arabia to if they can indeed arrest these Fifteen people who committed the murder and his temple that they would be tried in Istanbul on some level\nAside from that there was no facts there was no audio tape there was no DNA evidence and there's certainly wasn't a production of here is the bones saw that was used to this member of the body of ...\nSo what is what is the official story as of today from Saudi Arabia an hour they claiming that they're looking into it too or or water\nWrecked yeah they they say that they are investigating there's an ongoing investigation as well last we heard from Saudi Arabia they admitted that there was a murder of ... inside the consulate that it was a ... for their\nView that it was a fight that had gone wrong and then a fistfight had killed ... but from there all they could tell us with a fist fight kill them and then the people inside the consulate who actually did the killing went rogue on some level and apparently the Saudis are looking for those individuals as suspects in the murder of ... they\nApparently got the information that it was a fist fight and then no idea where the body is aren't able to track down the people that were in the room there\nEven though on more than one occasion according to Turkish investigators they have identified a few of the people that were in that room there was even a report in the past twenty four hours that there was a broadcast from with inside the cost a little sent to the consulate\nFrom one of prints all month close aides or south al ... who is apparently somebody who's close with the crown prince and also via Skype threatened\nA cause she'll be right there in the conflict so they had a broadcast of his phone call via Skype or where he was threatening to show yet at one point in time told the henchmen there were in that room to bring me the head of the dog um so now again\nNone of that offered V. approve if that was all on audiotape or where they were getting that information Turkish officials none of that was offered to parliament nor to the world today when he spoke to parliament president or to on a and it's this thing that he has all this information that we do know that the CIA director has gone overseas for the FBI Gina Haspel is there\nA we were told that she was going to monitor the situation I'm guessing she's trying to get in there and get as much in an information she can from the investigation to bring back to President Trump\nSo we're we're still artificial line is that we're still looking into it I guess is that it\nWe're still way I guess technically I mean it's not our investigation so we're literally waiting on the two parties involved here were waiting on turkey to complete their investigation which let's be fair they have not located a body in that that was a call made by\nA president or to one today as well asking for Saudi Arabia to let them know who within the confines of turkey was responsible for helping them get rid of the body and the Saudi officials who are saying that there are still try to track down these people that went rogue\nAnd that a one off the grid if you will and killing could show gay and they're trying to track those people down the suspect so until that's kind of wrapped up we're just at the behest of their investigations and getting as much information as we can\nMichael power um and I don't know if you can answer this question or not but I'm I don't know a lot about turkey and Saudi Arabia and their relationship um should we completely ...\nPlus turkey in all of this uh or or do they have an end chicken antagonistic relationship with Saudi Arabia\nThey there there is very much antagonism even to this point let me just highlighted by saying this but I'm the one I think his announcement today in front of that was happening at the exact same time that the crown prince was opening is financial seminar out there in Saudi Arabia\nHe was doing it purposefully to draw attention away from Saudi Arabia\nAnd the crown prince and his big conference of all of these big business people that were going to be in Saudi Arabia that the U.S backed up and I believe that the other countries are so backed off of a he did it the exact same time to draw attention away from that end towards themselves so uh this is not a great relationship between the two I\nDon't think turkey wants to go out of their way to create a bad relationship and sort of falsifying this information but\nI Do think that there is a sort of a combative element between the two especially when you've got this new reign of the crown prince tried to be I guess less less Muslim friendly or Arab friendly and you've got the the Muslim world of the Turks are trying to stand their ground\nMichael by we're out of time thank you for your time today he got guys have a great rest of your morning and thank you for having to Gulf Coast morning [noise]\n\nAnd this is a Bloomberg market ... ... at the open with the Dow falling more than three hundred points and the geo

to the Saudi conflict premeditated\nA well we're going to know\n'em and we'll we'll talk about this again later before finished with the hour but uh and by the way Carlo piss has joined us a here along with Ron had junior from heads heating and air conditioning so uh where are we at that time of year now we're we're going to be transitioning out of the the sweat into into foot on a sweater\nYeah we may be it's a good look who deal the morning and yesterday and ah I had turned my heat on at my house it didn't get cold enough and the short of a period of time to cause me to have to but I had turned the heat on in my truck word [laughter]\nYeah this is the time of year I Know um when it when it when we talk about maintenance for air conditioners when I think of that I think about it mainly in terms of making sure that I that I get the most uh for my money because of well maintained air conditioners going to be more energy efficient it's going to last longer\nA and I don't want it to break down a on a weekend or at night or something but when I think of a maintenance for this time of year uh see I use gas I think about it as terms of safety I Want to be safe um uh\nThat's important right that's the number one gas is very important to have checked every year and make sure they're operating properly\nThey're clean a cause a lot of times when they get dirty that's when you start having issues would produce and CEO and uh if you have some other things going wrong with your unit\nA lot of can produce CEO and you never even know is doing it high quality to kill somebody and you don't know it because you haven't had a check and it's just everything's working right so it's going out and you don't know that is going on or but all it takes is one\nThing that happens and then everybody's in trouble\nSo skipping a year of maintenance on on on on gas bad\nThat I recommend that no of course if you will recommend it but um\nBut if as you pointed out this is this is such a safety issue even if it if if it doesn't uh if if it's not the end of you can make you sick rhyme\nDeath and the and it's it's even worse the older the heater is the more the you definitely don't want to skip or our way you want to get it checked\nOut you know the year and you always wanted right now is the least turned your unit on so you know this operational whether it be a heat pump for any other\nUh but it's a good time just getting checked out before you hit that good cold spell and you flip that switch and go oh no I don't have any [laughter]\nWhat um when when somebody calls you for maintenance uh for for this time of year what kind of things will you do\nIs depending on whether it's a gas heater for say ...\nOr ... or strength electric straight electric has a list and everything else to do but on the gas heater we checked operation we look at your burners make sure everything's burning Bernard shaw clean\nNowadays we have like a jet burner so there we don't have to clean burners as much but we have to look into your heat exchange or make sure things cleaning your you've got a fan now that pulls the exhaust up blows it out the roof and sometimes you have to pull in clean those\nAnd uh make sure they're operational properly or you know make sure everything your electrical component suicide that unit or good we don't see anything burnt or looks like is burning\nUh and make sure your fans and good operational Shay\nOn heat pumps we have to check refrigerant charges we have to check make sure that you're going into deep frost motor cars they outdoor unit on the heap up process up and can freeze over if it doesn't the process so [noise] so we have to check those out and we have to check the inside out too because it's part of the heap all\nMake she calls are growing look at 'em make sure they're clean\nA liquor all your electrical components in there and make sure he strips are coming on and operational\nIs it a good time of year to have that done\nYes you do want to do it before it gets so cold that you actually running that and when it comes to safety that's more important than anything else and when you just have a cold spell like overnight\nThat thing you may run it and you run it for a short period and you may not realize there's an issue there when we have those few times where we have those longer cold spells and that thing runs a heck of a lot new issues can show up and that's when they become the most unsafe\nOkay so now is a good time to get in touch with heads heating and air conditioning and have that maintenance done to five one six five three seven eight seven three that's two five one six five three seven eight seven three\nNow when somebody comes to you and they want a a new unit when they're they're um either it's new construction or they they want all new for their house how do you weigh the pros and cons of what type of heating system to use\nA lot of times just as an older homeless depending upon what they actually have and what they're willing to spend\nA because if you've got a gas system in your house and you go so you want to go to ... because you don't want gassy anymore then you've got to generally get a larger electrical a\nPrank or an electrical wire up to run the heater a sea won't really change too much but the the the heat or an ... and the calls that are in the addict wheel and you so you have an electric fence getting power to it\nAnd uh so that that plays a part in it\nIn our area most of the\nTime but we're mostly ... mark ... and this being because gas is lower fired\nAnd a man and you've got more heat than you need\nAnd so your energy costs as a little bit higher okay and uh now they do make some really energy efficient haters but when you get to those calls goes way up on them and uh but the decision that space generally what they have there if they have gas they have electric\nAnd that's how we go about it a lot of neighborhoods on new construction that's not even in our air thing\nThe some neighborhoods they make deals with the gas company and get special things on gas the piping in the neighborhood and get gas the houses and uh I don't know what all their the builders get something I don't know what all they get on it but\nAnd we have to just you know throw at people hey do the whole nine yards and it's going to be this much instead of saying let's take steps in the right direction and see when it finally read leaves your symptoms and when you're basically in a position to say okay well now let me focus on you know the kids' soccer\nSeason or the holidays coming up or whatever because most folks don't want to focus on the things that we do for them they are drawn to dealing with it because it is\nJust a thorn in their side that they can't get rid of\nAnd we understand that and so we want to help them solve it and get beyond it and get back to the things they they enjoy doing on a minute to minute basis\nYou're listening to heads heating and air conditioning\nUm and as you just heard in this segment it's way more than just heating and air conditioning\nWe're going to take a timeout for weather
