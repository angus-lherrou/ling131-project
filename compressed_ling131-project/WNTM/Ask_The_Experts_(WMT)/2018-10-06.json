Kavanaugh is expected later today it comes after a dramatic decision by Senate Republican Susan Collins of Maine Mr President\nThat just was ethic but\nWhat made it even more important when you watched it on TV and I'm sure we're going to hear the numbers are massive\nThere were two women prominently featured behind Susan Collins\nNow so often we hear that the Republican Party is the party of a bunch of old white guys were you at three women featured you couldn't see\nI'm Joni Ernst shoes off to the side but she was up there too but you had Susan Collins front and center in a very professional look I think she got a new hair cut too I'm sure she did you know oh it's all about image it's all about optics\nSusan Susan Collins up there on one side Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia Republican senator\nTo the other side Cindy Hyde Smith a senator from Mississippi right behind her so now you have this moment where we as conservatives have had the tar beaten out of us for the last three weeks\nBeing accused of being just the worst people in the world the party that does not understand women\nAnd you have a woman\nDelivering the knockout punch a woman who is known to be pro choice\nSo now you have someone that other women especially boy that was ... that argument that judge Kavanaugh is going to a destroy roe v Wade you have a pro choice women standing in front of the world talking about how Kavanaugh can't do it\nThat in fact that the the people that the um the Democrats who are worried about tearing apart ruby way ... years ago not only did they not do it they wrote the argument against overturning roe v wait\nSo you have brilliantly staged brilliantly written delivered for an audience that would then turn it into prime time\nResponse so after all of the theater this week after all the circus atmosphere for the last eight days in Washington DC you ended with an epic finish\nSo bravo to you geo pay bravo to you and to the what was it five hundred plus protestors arrested today I think I'm not sure\nI think Spartacus got arrested today I'm not sure I think that that would make sense for him because that would be a good campaign commercial for a twenty twenty presidents he hopes for ah\nFor Cory Booker or should we call them sugar as I\nTalked to guys last night I found the ah yearbooks from some of the angry Democrats on the Judiciary Committee started going through their senior year books to say gee what was the new year book\nCory Booker had his nickname sugar\nAnd I don't know about you but I Lived in the New York New Jersey metro area where Cory Booker lived and went to school in those years in the late eighties and a\nBook or we call a cocaine was referred to as sugar so why were you sugar senator is there something you need to tell us and also the guy who said he had um\nGroped a young woman at the age of Fifteen in the article he wrote called stealing second or something like that a book or a also had his senior quote was let's go all the way\nSo Cory Booker has some ... to do but he may be got arrested today it's not really an arrest as we saw with Amy Schumer yesterday it's kinda like being scurried off to get your picture taken and then somebody pays fifty bucks you get a ticket and you go home where you go back to the protests\nBut there is so much to get to today so much I'm just so happy about this and we will dig into it but I Want to remember\nWhat sparked all of this and it was Donald Trump nominating\nMr Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh and on the day when that happened Chris Matthews the elder statesmen and MSNBC you have to wonder how much longer he's going to continue in his role\nA Chris Matthews was on the air talking about\nRevenge\nAnd I tell you all of this\nAll of this anger towards anything Donald Trump does towards any nominee he brings forward all of this resistance an obstruction which started the day after Trump was elected\nIt's a dangerous thing for the Democrats it said when you go out and develop all of your missions in life based on revenge they\nTell you to dig two graves\nBecause you're going to be joining whoever you think you're going to take down remember this from June twenty eighth this year Chris Matthews on MSNBC following the announcement of the Supreme Court pick from President Trump\nSays it's time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the vengeance now with four and a half weeks four and a half months to go before the election they will not look very strong to their face and I think there'll be under attack\nYeah yeah that was a good plan wasn't it wasn't a Chris Matthews if you don't if you don't go after vengeance and he's talking about Merrick Garland he was talking about Hillary's loss or I'll I'll tell you to talk about backfiring\nBecause the way the shrill arguments came out without facts which was a hundred and eighty degrees from what Susan Collins delivered today they sounded like a bunch of people especially when you hear the chanting\nThat chanting the nonstop shrill chanting it just great and great in grades\nNow I I'd like to say this is a a\nA good sign for the midterms but a month in political terms is an eternity\nIt's an absolute eternity so I have sort of a plan that I think the GOP should lay out in advance of the midterms that will keep the interest\nOf those of us who are conservatives who wants to try and save the house although it's a really tough tough event to try and pull off\nTo save the house when the president or out of the other part when you know what happens when you get the house and the Senate and the presidency and the very next election the midterms\nHistory tells us it always balances out and the voters will get power back to the other party so for the geo Peter retain house would be a little bit of a miracle but I have a plan and that will share with you\nI also want to hear your thoughts on today if you have any thoughts on that it's friday let's have some fun and I have a really\nRidiculous question for you\nI Know the other day I asked a question about what's the what was the scariest movie of all time and a lot of you came up with great answers well today I reached maximum anger\nAt the worst jangle ever\nAnd I know you've heard jingles it doesn't have to be a current jingle it can be an old commercial jingle one is the worst jingle ever you know it's an ear worm it sticks in your ear I'm going to give you money you want to call in with yours and you can sing it or you can ... you can say however you want\nBut when I hear one age seven seven times for kids I Won a stab my radio\nOne age seven seven times for kids and then they say donate your car today they don't say donate your car today\nThey say hey you're what the hell is done neck\nAll right that's my crazy thought for the day if you have a a thought for this Friday a celebratory thought as we get into a great weekend hopefully\nHopefully twenty four hours

on the back\nNot only did you make it but I think reason and logic and this system work and it it didn't work really well because the only one Democrat\nOn a forty nine Democrats is voting to confirm\nJudge Kavanaugh to elevate him to justice Kavanaugh\nOnly one out of forty nine that's not a good thing that really is\nNot a good thing but there is good news on a new poll on Fox that says are the things that are most important to people in the mid term ... number one thing\nIs uh the economy now number two is healthcare and if you paid attention to date to Susan Collins or yesterday if you've been listening to\nPresident Trump in his speeches at these campaign rallies he is brought up specifically\nHow he wants to make sure the pre existing conditions are protected\nSo with the number one issue being the economy and the number to issue being healthcare the president or well he's already addressed the economy with the economy the economy's working it's bought off right now three point seven percent unemployment\nThe lowest since Nineteen sixty nine and companies\nAre now are actually working to lure people who left the employment world to come back to work they're trying to come up with new ways to get\nSome of the women who left to go have families to come back to work they're trying to get people to feel jobs in the manufacturing sector\nTo come back to work there are\nThousands upon thousands of good jobs in both\nManufacturing and in the trade that are on filled all you have\nTo do is listen to what Mike Rowe talks about if you don't fall Mike Rowe on Twitter or Facebook or visit\nMike Rowe works on the line Mike Rowe work so one word you're missing out if you would like to have a career that you're probably never going to worry about being unemployed there are literally\nTens of thousands of jobs that are good paying jobs we're talking fifty to a hundred and fifty grand a year\nAnd they are jobs you might need a little trade school for but micro works will show you how you can uh get scale and then go to work and my puts out scholarships for stuff like that so uh check that I didn't mean to get off track also the\nNumber one in all the top issues of what voters are looking for in the mid term stuff is thing guns because Democrats are going to try and make gun rights again a big deal\nAnd Donald Trump be is a I think Donald Trump is throwing a couple of bombs towards the people who are are are kind of squishy on\nGuns now I'm a Second Amendment guy I'm On a lifetime and I remember um a concealed carry weapons permit holder I'm

blood pressure goes up I could buy a pop tart into the shape of a gun and my sister would have a problem but the president has said he is going to sign something on bump stocks\nAnd if you are a fan of bump stocks than a I'm Sorry but um if the if it's illegal to own an automatic weapon a fully automatic weapon I think bump stocks are skirting that law\nAnd I think we can win points with some of those uh hospitals folks\nIf we would say bump stocks are are good thank you disagree with me convinced me that's just one of those things that this gun owners descent or a member is in lockstep with the president or so that that's where I'm at\nAll right that's a couple of things are going on today 'cause we still have a lot to get two for the midterms and I will give you my a plan\nCan hear from

sounds good come up to a lecture and but when somebody actually scripture in our heart is you know Congress there's truth to power before Trump that was a pretty rare thing\nAnd I think she tapped

bay coins and fine jewelry you'll find mobile by going some fun jewelry at twenty two oh for government street in midtown mobiles [noise] you're ... you can look for them on Facebook [noise]\nSlipped from oh we'll buy coaching fun jewelry and like that page also a later if you're out and about now I'm In er just listening on the radio you can find video of this interview\nOr later I'm sure you you can find it on my ... the official uncle and re Facebook page you may be able to find that shared by mobile bay coins and fine jewelry later today so that this video will be available for your analysis later now Angela we've had to talk for many many years about\nPeople buying gold and silver as a hedge against\nInflation Yes sir and this is something that has come up again I'm starting to hear we went a while where I didn't hear commercials on the radio or see them on TV about this and now suddenly I'm seeing these commercials pop up again\nI'm seeing the commercials first of all the commercials are urging people to buy silver because these commercials have alleged experts claiming that within five years silver is going to go through the roof and you need to get in early right and then they also talk about it in terms of a hedge against inflation\nCan you give us a little bit of an education\nAbout what it means if you're buying bullion to use as ahead\nSure and I want to sort of qualify a couple of things when these when these people out there are using scare tactics and trying to get you to buy gold or silver because before you know it's silver is going to get a ... a hundred dollars and ...\nThat's exactly what I've heard several occasions in the middle of the night is when I hear these commercials\nActually hurt one when I was driving over to that that that a state of praise low vote\nAt all I heard it you know the ... well I Know I Know exactly what you're talking about and got rather angry as\nA matter of fact because the ... it was sort of started off on a radio show and sort of segue into the commercial and the phrase was when gold hits twenty five thousand dollars announce you're going to want this product you know that's how you're going to barter and trade for things\nThey said twenty five thousand ...\nAll this was for gold oh okay they'll just gold silver is going to be over a hundred silver at a hundred ...\nGold was twenty five thousand dollars announced that is it twenty times increase from where it is now roughly so if you take a look and say okay we'll we'll gasoline has two fifty a gallon give or take and we're gonna make gasoline twenty times that rate our economy would come to a crashing halt\nBecause gold and silver don't go up all by themselves there there are a commodity other commodities what also rise dramatic correct and be a cataclysm if if if gold is that high then there's some catastrophe precisely and that's\nWhat makes me really angry with these things to say they make it sound like this is going to happen and only gold and silver going to go up well that either means that a the dollar has been completely devalued and crashed heavily or something else extremely dramatic and bad is going on\nIn the world today and going on with our economy well\nThen let surreal it into reality to explain the reality of using gold and silver as a hedge\nSo the reality is that is if you took a silver dime or a silver quarter\nOr one of the things I Want to ask about is the fine jewelry part of mobile bay coins we've talked a lot about precious metals and and different billion items in this particular show but over half the store looks like it is filled with jewelry so talk a bit about the types of jewelry that you have\nWell for one but it's talk about what we'll be coins and find jewelry having fine jewelry what that means is those items are made out of either a gold platinum or sterling silver they're not silver plated they're not gold plated onto a base metal they are on\nPrecious metals and again it could be a sterling silver ring that's been gold plated but its gold over silver it's not gold over cop or a nickel or something like that uh there are a lot of people that have allergies to base metals they have allergies to nickel allergies copper things like that\nSo they have to be very careful what types of jury they purchase and that's why we carry fine jewelry their mobile bitcoins we purchased those types of items\nWe have thousands of different jewelry items there in stock at the shop\nAnd something else that's really really important there been a lot of jewelry stores closing around town and I know a lot of folks are starting to panic and worry and wonder\nWhere can they get the ring looked at work and they get their jewelry repaired where can they get a new piece of jewelry made and we actually have a jeweler on staff there immobile bake points he's there in the shop Monday through friday\nWe do all that work right there in the store we can order and customs settings weekend ordering you know special diamonds for you whatever you want and make a custom piece of jewelry and we do all of that right there although they once\nSo all of this that people may have been wondering about your right we've had some some ... jewelers closed down or you can pick up the slack\nAbsolutely as a matter of fact we'd love to have folks come by show off their pieces jewelry and we can take a look at the settings make sure the stone is still amounted nice and solid anti you don't want to have a a a nice diamond fall out of your engagement ring for example if it needs to be re sized or repaired maybe the ... need to be touched up we do all of that work right there\nAngela how I've already told the listener that about half of what you have on display is fine jewelry is are forms of jewelry up mobile bay coins in fine jewelry of what is on display how often does that turn over how often do you have new items pop up in the display case for people to look\nAt almost every day because every day we're purchasing something from somebody that's coming into the shop\nAnd so every day we have new items that are coming out of hold new to us are new to the public and usually Tony will get those first to hell refurbish those clean those ... beautiful again and then we'll put those out for sale and I also wanted to remind you and remind the listeners\nThat just because you don't see something on display does not necessarily mean that we don't have it the jewelry display there at the shop is almost like the tip of the iceberg because\nThere is a safe behind and that is full of different items who juries so if you're looking for a sterling silver cross for example and you don't see the exact when you like out there in the case ask the questions because we have many more items their inventory\nAnd it can usually look those up very quickly for you find what you're hopefully find something you're looking for and gets taken care of but you've got to ask questions don't just glance around and then then feel disappointed\nWhen we ... we talk about fine jewelry people may wonder about price points at mobile bay coins and find joy do you have things for people that are that may not be able to afford the the extravagant jewelry\n[noise] well I think you'll find that we have some very very extravagant pieces of\nFood do but I haven't seen him yes\nWe do not have extravagant prices matter of fact a few weeks ago it was very very funny because the lady came in wanting to look at some jewelry when you look at some of the gold and silver ... as well\nAnd she was looking at sterling silver rings and we told her the price and she was so shocked and so excited she literally ended up buying about a dozen rings and then went over to the gold and silver side and started her head was some actually some junk silver and a couple of American silver eagles but\nShe was looking at rings earlier that week at one of the big box stores and she said the rings we're averaging a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars for sterling silver rings and she was picking up the exact same style of ring very very similar designs in fact a couple of them are even garde or she said\nI'm Sorry fancier [laughter]\nToday gaudy but she was paying somewhere between Nineteen and twenty five dollars a piece there at the shop so in her mind she could get four or five six rings for what she would have paid for wondering earlier that week\nWow so uh we're almost out of time I'm again you want to just go in and if you don't see what you what you want in the jury selection make sure you speak up and ask\nBecause they do have a just a tremendous majority that they just can't put on display them too many pieces of jewelry mobile back once and find jewelry before run at a time we're getting closer to football season last football season you you really\nWorked your way into the hearts of mine and minds of many people locally by coming up with elephant silver elephant around you sir now are you going to have more of the silver elephant rounds available for football season we've\nAlready restock those and they had been selling like Matt and something that I think it's quite interesting is last year people would come in and buy one silver elephant round or one open a pocket knife\nNow they're coming in and they're buying four five six of those types of items because they know that when they're friends see them they're going to want one I'm not sure if they're giving these to their friends or if they're selling them to their friends or or what they're doing but we're now selling those elephants generally speaking for the time were last year we were selling them one at a time\nWhy okay literally yeah people are coming in and not just getting a elephant they're getting at least for almost every single time it's almost funny\nAnd these elephants you've probably heard that they are they one side is buying so you can and grapes something on the other side you can put something personal you can put a roll tide you could put the date of a specific game or\nAb Eighteen yet nobody want to put Eighteen\nOr you know that is weird we have to get into numerology and figure that out but there are there are lots of ways to take that one item and turn it into something even though so many people bought one you can make your unique\nYou certainly can and and it's got a selection of the Christmas rounds in bars available there for people to look at at the shop so if you really plan ahead we're getting an order together within the next week for some of those engraved well Christmas Christmas rounds and Christmas bars if you want to get some your Christmas shopping done very very early\nWow okay so that is all available at mobile bay conscience ... for government street in midtown immobile with people all ready and the reason you have the Christmas rounds is because people were actually asking for them this early\nThey were asking when they were going to come in what designs we would have and how many could we get so anti plant ahead talk to the supplier got a small selection and so people can see them and also has some order form show there as well so we can get them pre ordered in place to get this knocked off of\nPeople's lists very very or what that is amazing\nMobile bay coins and find jewelry twenty two oh for government street in midtown mobile look for them on Facebook go visit them Angelo is just as nice in person as he is on the air [noise] so you will enjoy your

Fox News hours from now the Senate is expected\nTo vote on whether to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court President Trump of course made the right decision in picking judge Kavanaugh and President Trump just by Brett Kavanaugh\nWho that they even touched on that point you just said as huge as I'm sure everybody had to\nHad to call some large company at some time and ah it can be quite frustrating actually have to set a portion of your day aside just because you know it's gonna be that way so at least of us you\nCan call one number you talked to that person and we try to get taken care of for you right then okay that's a huge plus for me [laughter] his for pay as well\nYou know what are the differences in the way you wear your philosophy toward contracts because I understand that a lot of the other people in your industry sometimes they have these really long contracts a lot of times people don't understand what they're signing up for\nWe we do we have short term agreements 'em\nAnd part of our thinking behind that as well with if we can make you or if you're happy customer and\nYou know we don't go up on your monitoring we keep your rights are saying we feel like there's no need to to for someone for someone into a a long term agreement that to us that's kind of almost like you're telling semi or\nYou know this long term agreement just you know we want you in air and you're hearing here this\nLong and we know after this time you're gone wrong and we don't want to think about it that way right\nYeah you are you have the almost an opposite approach that you're you're ... you're really making sure that people want to stick with you and that's because you don't change my rate I signed up a couple of years ago with you [noise] you've told me that rates are going to go up as long as I'm a customer\nIt it it is correct\nLast I add some some new technology if I add something that's that I don't have that could change it but if I don't if I just keep it the way it is I don't have to pay more in the years to come\nIn and it it it helps us too because if it does come to a point and say at customer does want to leave for some reason we can feel good about it that we know\nIt's not us and it wasn't anything like that that drove them off and you know some things certain people do you just can't change and it's a lot easier to move pass at that point\nNow can you if somebody has some other companies system or in there at the end of a contract can you use that same equipment is is it a is that a simple process to transfer from one company two years\nUm most of the stuff out there we can use easily the stuff that are\nMaybe somewhat of an obstacle is\nAh for the most part maybe antiquated equipment and we need to get them something new or any way that it's probably not going to work with maybe the modern stuff they might want to do any how some people may not want to use the old equipment but if they do I would say nine out of ten times were able to\nTo ... is very it's we're in and out within an hour I'm just very simple uh normally we would just take over exactly what you have a we just send to send it to our monitoring station and or if there's any and all and you want to change would do it at that point as well in in a lot\nWith the older equipment some some\nSome customers think that hey you know I've got this old equipment I Want to do to do all these things and they think that right away I've got to replace everything well\nThere's some some of the things that they may want to do we make can achieve it even with the older equipment we may have to add a little bit more up to date technology to that system that we make and make some of those things happen with what's in place\nWhere it's so so a lot of the differences are that your contracts are shorter than a lot of your competitors\nLike less ... shorter agreement\nAnd and the the price the monitoring rate is not going to go up at all as long as I keep the same equipment and don't add on new technologies\nUm and most of the time they will save money with us actually OK radial even lower okay\nThat's a ... irate generally a fraction of what a national company would charge and for us to come out and look at your system take it over there is no charge for that\nLike a mark was saying the only charge would be if you want to add some additional stuff at that point\nBut basically you can have us come out take your system over for a charge me the first months monitoring a you're going to have a lower agreement short term agreement and you're better off every way\nAnd you get ill or someone locally\nAnd um I didn't realize this until I signed up with you that I get a little bit of this kennel my homeowner's insurance because of monitored security desk corrected\nA help they [noise]\nThey they haven't figured where someone with the security system as being monitored a police fire paramedic come out than it saves them in any a potential losses they may have on the insurance side so they passed that savings zone to the homeowner I'm not\nI'm not going to say I'm thrilled with my phone ring um texting thirty pounds a day with service issues yes I Would much prefer the customer do call them office so we can efficiently take care of them but I Want to bring the point that how many national companies can you text the local guys say I've got an issue can you get this taken care of for me well\nYou know that's that's another big I added value because typically if you do for national company\nYou're going to be calling on one eight hundred number and I think they love the convenience of the fact that they can do that really easy\nYeah that's a that is a big big plus ... you know where you you know where the company is and you know that their local people there and you can deal with them\nWe're going to take a quick break and we're going to get him more in depth on actual security systems what is available for people these days with all the new technology will get into that next\nWith CSI alarms in audio the website T.

[laughter]\nWe fix a lotta we're fixing more and more adding upgrading more and more ... waited audio equipment\nUh oh yeah okay All right well we'll have to get into that and ended up coming segment before we're at a time on on the topic of cameras though um [noise] how different is the installation part of that because the cameras need power mhm so do you connect into how do you do that there is some\nThat there are a few different options one would be yeah there are traditional cameras that need power and\nBest options in technology available with the with with those cameras or the next one is cameras that can get on your wife five but still need power right ah and then there's the third option which there are cameras that or\nI put them in the same category there's some battery operated one which we don't want that no I mean I don't want to charge cameras up so my customers don't it's not really I I don't want to customers don't want to say that to do that is at the Iowa mindset and those were on our customers though\nThe battery operated and then there's another piece not gonna name brand or or anything like that but there's another one are out there that has a a has a uh uh what do you call it solar panel with it\nIt's got a little wire jumping off the camera and literally that solar panels about as big as a like if you know ... up had many yeah I don't know too many customers that are going to be cool with me putting that on their house no it's not even something will even entertain as an option for for\n... there's yeah there's type they're just not where they need to be right now all a T everything about oh maybe one day eventually you know it'll get how things are going to shut down the road there will be\nSome legitimate stuff out there\nNow I ... I can control my security system down on an app on my phone I can turn it on and off from the driveway um all of that and be alerted here at work if something goes wrong at home what are the options would the cameras and you do the same thing\nYeah I mean you can ah course remotely monitor from anywhere you have a an Internet or data connection or and or you can actually rewind fast forward you know basically control your system for from those locations we can also set up motion activation where uh\nIn the event it takes any kind of emotion that gets in your email text or both so I mean there's really a lot of customer ... ... that can go on with giving you that you know offsite remote control of that of that system\nTalk a bit you you mentioned in one of the previous segments video door bells talk about that\nIt's a\n... is really probably the most popular videos stuff we're doing just because it's the least expensive I guess\nThe big bang for your buck yeah um it's very easy to use uh most of them you can communicate with your cell phone you know when it'll it\nSomeone approaches the door you can have it set for motion which is going to notify your phone a pitcher comes up you can talk with them and also when they run your doorbell it does the same thing um\nSo that's a that's\nThe pitcher qualities fairly well a little kid getting pretty reliable um it it it is somewhat\nI see it's still improving um\nSometimes it can activity based on your Internet that's totally how will this kind of work for you um if you slow Internet and its lagging and\nThere's going to be a delight 'til you can the pitcher comes up you can tall right that it might be a grainy picture but fast Internet usually a we have zero issues that's our biggest struggle\nYou know we put a lot of them in and we do have to get it on your wife foster like Scott said you need to have a good strong ... background which I mean a backbone if you don't we can course help you with that but that is one of the biggest things and the other thing it relies on his like Scott said is a is a good Internet\nConnection so unfortunately we have a small percentage of those that we do that we can sometime be somewhat plagued with some issues but those issues are all from those those things and uh we've got to just give the customer and get that part right yeah\nAnd well let's talk about that or just for a moment because I Know from previous shows you can help people if they if they have problems with why five right you can extend the range\nOh yeah I'm just that some of the times we've had to come in to fix issues like that where it's\nThe ah the ... is too far from the source so we have to build an different extenders and that that that'll fix the problem you're on new construction we'd go in and we don't let it be a problem we account for that before\nUs when we start we want we want to customize it around their wants and needs\nAnd we can do that within you give us a budget and we can make it we can make it work for you\nEvery day every single day is is honestly a new adventure for us if we've done a hundred jobs not one of those were like the other\nAre now the job you did for me on audio and video is just that one room\nHow many people want you to do an entire house\nOr a a lot uh I mean what are the options there we can take what you have with that so notion we can just get room by room we can customize each room how we want to do it someone says you know I'd like a couple of those sitting above my\nA cabinet send the kitchen or you know I'd like to sit on the counter or you know what I don't want to see him I Want him in the civil and so we have a device that Senate snakes that we can run the speakers into so we can you take it room by room customize it at the end of the day they can have an apple like you have and they can have\nFive six seven eight rooms and they can play 'em altogether play him individually play different sources are different you could be playing Pandora\nAnd your kitchen is someone could be in your back porch play in a you know Amazon Music or whatever [noise]\nUh so it really has a lot of ah individual control volume control and that's what people want the last thing they want is\nIs to go into a room and be able to play music but they have to run back to the receiver or whatever piece of equipment to change channels a volume and all those kind of things so that's what makes that experience so nice\nOne of the other things that makes the experience so nice is that the way your installers install so that there is a minimum of any kind of cables are wires or anything like that if it can be hidden it is\nThat's we pride ourselves on the you're totally right\nUm we want to give them a different experience than\nSome\nOf the big box stores out there that might have a\nWe don't give you that than just the advice and now I mean if you can't if we can give you that than just go to go to the store and buy it and just get some my handyman to put it in and or or go get it yourself and put it in if you feel like you can do just to get a job so we don't want you to think that way we want to be done with it and we want you to say man you know\nThat would have taken me hours or or I'm Glad they did it I Love the job so that's what so important and gives us we think relevancy and and what we're doing [noise]\nYeah it is a the installation is as good as it gets ... with these items that really is now you you um you help me find this television and installed it or you do that also I mean we talked a lot about the audio but you help people if they want TVs as well\nYeah far to the uh fear and say is a part of a bundled service it's you know as the TV is uh something we're we do for our customers just kind of as a\nAlmost as a thank you for using us\nThe services that we to streamline the service for them make their ... their life easier not having to go I'll go to home I'll get a best buy and buy some TVs meet you over the house you guys are coming at nine well you know\nWhether they do that which TV do we want to look at endless price out that TV if we can keep the price of the same or even save your money it's a win win for you 'cause now you don't have to mess with it yeah the margin taken I\nIt's kind of we're giving you this is good prizes you get it anywhere else and we're just going to have everything with this and make it a lot of other installation\nAnd I'll tell you now there is nothing in the base there is no highly any margin there's hardly any money and that's for the big box stores as well I mean that's what they a lot of these TVs the the big stores consider their loss leader\nThat get you in the store and make hardly anything on the TV but then you end up buying a ten dollar hundred and fifty dollar ac my cable about two hundred dollar TV mounted cost him twenty dollars and now they've made a good margin at the end of the day and they're making it on the the ad on she'd get with that\nWell it it it helps uh the to get it all through you not only for getting the best price the professional installation\nAnd also the part of the professional installation that looks fantastic but also um ah the installer helped me learn how to use all of it that also could take somebody a week or longer to figure out because it's not just one thing everything as as we've talked about is communicating with each other\nAnd it helps to have somebody that's that's installed it in those all of it to go over with you\nBrought up a good point and if I can say this real quick so\nAs a lot of things became wireless ... in some things that customers could install I was scared that\nYou know years ago and thinking man you know is this going to be

I went to a zipper technologies canned resume forms to find the right people\nAt about sixty five hundred we started at fourteen thousand folks went down to sixty five hundred last you know fifty seven percent of the S. and P. and then started bouncing back up again never again you you weren't in financial services at that time but certainly the meetings that you have with people now\nThis is still very fresh and their memory isn't it\n[noise] it is and you know people remember that a specially people that are you know in their you know around sixty five or seven because people when they happen to this and their mid fifties and they were looking at retiring sixty are even before then you know a lot of there's those dreams for crash because\nTheir um their four O. one K. became too ... because the other and essentially got cut\nTheir retirement savings and so that's something that you know when that happened to somebody and they were so close they could see the light at the end of the tunnel and then it got farther and farther away you know as the market kept dropping that's something that they we know people that they come in now and are ready to retire\nBecause they know now they can and they've they've gotten it back\nThey they're so afraid of doing that and some people sort of talked about as a force in ... when it comes to that but I bet you know some people you still come in and say I can't I Can't weather another two thousand eight Seventy to mean something to make sure that some of this is protected and that's something that's very fast on their minds still\nAnd you said the key word there Virginia some of this year's protected John that is the message of this program at the beginning of the show you say playing Cyndi ... so let's talk about that a little bit\nLet's talk about how do you play defense if we're ten years into this we know the market has their cycles as you say maybe it doesn't go down fifty percent maybe go down thirty percent what do we do to play a little ...\nWell it it is like you were saying it's fresh on their minds and if they were taking that exam she's for somebody in their fifties and they were working probably in their highest earning years and they were putting them most they could into four o one K\nNow if they had the same type correction that we had back in two thousand eight the percentage even if the percentage is the same the dollar amounts are going to be a lot more because they're account balances and so uh\nSo what we try to do is position people when they come in and we get all their information we try to position their their buckets of money to build in more of a defensive posture not putting your money out and keep it in cash and earning nothing but I haven't heard him very attractive writes\nIn different insurance products that in most cases do not have any fees or any charges in them the money is still participating in in market gains but if the market does take a turn and they're not going to lose anything we use of example in our presentation Randy that a is an actual climbs named Billy\nAnd Billy became a client in two thousand and seven\nHe had money that had done very well in on ESPN paid five hundred mutual fund everybody who has a four O. one K. probably has money in an effort that they've ever a mutual Yvonne\nWell what we showed him 'cause he was on the radio when we showed him was why don't we capture that game and it was one of his are always want to capture that game and move that over into this indexed annuity where your earnings are tired to the S. and P. five hundred but not directly invested in the U.S and the five hundred\nIf it does good you do good if it goes down you don't lose anything zero becomes your hero\nSo what we've done is we've kept track of belief indexed annuity back from two thousand seven all the way till two thousand and eight teen\nAnd when you come and we've also kept track of that same as the five hundred a mutual fund its ups and downs during those years and we had some other down years during that period of time but when we look at averaging out the numbers in the indexed annuity the worst we did was zero in some years\nBut we had good when the market was up we did good when the market was down we didn't lose the things that we didn't have to spend one two three five years making up where we had lost like you would in in the mutual fund\nBecause we start over every year in the in the index annuity it resets every year so you don't have to make up lost ground is very attractive for a defensive posture in those type portfolios and we're not talking about all the money all we're doing as someone gets older let's say their their ah sixty five years old\nThe root of won't understand they ought to have sixty five percent of their money protected from risk if they're Seventy five they oughta have Seventy five percent of the money protected some risk protect your age from risk so therefore we can gradually move\nMore and more of the money's over into protected products so if we do we don't know if we're going to have a correction or not and when we do we don't know how long how much is going to be or how long it's going to last\nBut why take the risk and most of our class they come to us they don't have to chase returns they don't have to try to make\nTen twelve fourteen percent in the market they're very comfortable making very attractive returns in the high single digits low teens returns inside indexed annuities and not having to chase the returns with the risk that inherently involved in those type things which they didn't have these Bronx available to them back in the\nBack in the seventies you know but in this particular case there's so many options out there to protect them money and allowing people to have attracted games without the risk\nYeah and you know we also have if we do we do have some clients that want to protect 'em a good portion of the night we never\nYou know putting all the money in in one thing whenever putting all our eggs in one basket we want to make sure that we're protecting some of it and then some people that want to take a lot of risk that a little bit at the money or they don't want to take any risk today on the line but we we do maybe structure some\nA little bit more risk for some of the money because they are protecting so much of it so we have different balances just depending on the line and this week that\nIs very cautious but the majority of his money but he wanted to take about five percent of it and and go and be aggressive and the market with it but by nature he's not very aggressive he just wanted to\nYes had a little bit sort of the uh to play with\nAthletes in order to roll the dice most small bit of his\nMoney yeah exactly that and we did that as well that yeah billion that defense is very important\nWell as you were describing that John I was thinking to myself there's the guide their belly who took the risk off the table and he was able to still see girls buddy\nDidn't have to worry about the financial headlines you didn't have to worry about all that risk that to the market brings because he wasn't really associated with at risk and that's got to make people feel good when they sit and look at their account and so you know even if\nWe do have a crash I'm not going to go down with that that that's got to be feel pretty good\nIs when you're like a fair when you averaging zeroes instead of a negative Billy since two thousand and seven to two thousand and Eighteen\nHe's got sixty one percent more money in his indexed annuity than he would have had he kept his S. and P. five hundred a mutual fund wow so you know so that's that's a pretty big deal so we've got long track records\nWith these concepts and putting together portfolios and it's not appropriate for everyone some people we we don't use it all others of most of the time as people get older they won't less and less risk but they do not want to give up return for that and we don't have to\nWell we would love to introduce you to what we're talking about here in the way we do that is offer you what we call our retirement road map and this is\nAn opportunity for you to sit down with the folks in mobile bay financial solutions and a and get an assessment of where you are right now be look at that risk level where is your money and how risk averse are you and how risky is your money going along this is probably something you don't really know\nWe can help you point pinpoint that also talk about things like Social Security and we'll talk about legacy we'll\nTalk about taxes will talk about a lot of different things and it'll really give you a really good look at where you are right now we are for this to you or radio listeners free of charge all you have to do is give us a call\nAnd it's two five one six six six five thousand same number is always to five one six six six five thousand you can look up online as well let him be financial solutions dot com and be financial solutions\nDot com or I'm going to take us a little further back of the time machine we went back to two thousand eight about we go back to two thousand well let's go back even further Nineteen eighty okay well here's a news report from Nineteen eighty I Want you to pay close attention to these numbers\nCBS News this is layers break bad news on the inflation fried wholesale prices were up again in February nearly a twenty four sat at a while right\nThat inflation report most major banks raised their prime landing right to Seventeen and three quarters for that for corporate ...\nSo Virginia how 'bout that three quarter percent CD can we get one of those men than me\n[noise]\nYeah but along with that goes you're twenty percent house note your twenty percent car note your twenty percent credit card it kinda evens out doesn't\nYeah I'd rather take the Seventeen percent CD and keep my three and a half percent mortgage\nThere's the problem is my first house I bought a Nineteen eighty six pain point ... percent air ... three and then I well I got a good deal in the house but the thing about it is\nThough is I Know those numbers are just outrageous and that's just not that long ago but what if you know as interest rates go up inflation goes up with it this is something that we've got to build into our retirement plans isn't it\nIt is very important when we look at you know we know what things cost today we know gas as we sit here today oil is a is rapidly approaching a hundred dollars a barrel which means our gas is going to be extremely high inflation is coming we don't know how fast around highest gonna go\nBut it's a lot easier to be a little more envious of the hair that you know always seems to be ahead of you but you know just chipping away at it and putting that money every every other week or whatever every week or every month and to the savings accounts in um Education Fund for the kids and everything like that and just paying yourself first and getting that done\nYou know that's just it just it just goes to show you in the ... and those people that come in and they don't think they have enough because they've just been slowly putting chipping away at it and always putting away and always putting away and they get here they get to this point they don't realize that they've gotten to the finish line and it's a really great thing to say okay you're here you've made it now we can retire\nAnd that's just the and that's and that's a really great I'm meeting to be a part of like you said\nYou're listening to it's your money with John McNeil and Virginia Mueller Brian and mobile bay financial solutions we would love to sit down and have a meeting like that wouldn't that be great for you to come in and say I\nDon't know if I can retire but then when we run the numbers you can maybe here that that voice saying why aren't you retired yes you can retire you can do what you always wanted to do that would be a wonderful meeting let's have that meeting here is our number two five one six six six five thousand to five one six six six five thousand give us a call and ask\nFor that retirement roadmap let's get you on that road to retirement you can find this on line at MB financial solutions dot com or going to talk about one of those ways that you kind of chip away at it putting money in their four O. one\nK. we're going to kind of dive deep into that coming up next with the help of that crazy guy I met ... some of that but it's your money\nBack

nothing we want you to protect some of that money and that's what this show is all about and we live\nThe rest of them that is really president [laughter]\nKnow they're just got it again and I like the\nPeople who listen to Nineteen Seventy four for ... really press than in concert\nGo that's right our lead trick orchestra and Seventy four [laughter] once again you're not even a twinkle in the either nah [laughter]\nAll right well I told you Jim Kramer on the show today okay so mad money you've seen the show on CNBC and he's got all the alarms and the ... and all the sound effects and all the crazy stuff\nWell he got got serious the other day when he was talking about four oh one k.'s and retirement accounts and he's got some advice for all of us but I thought I'd play this for you and get your take on it Erie is Airforce\nOne K. is important but it has its downsides plenty of people said high fees and ministry of course is a problem and they definitely eat away at your retirement capital there is no question about it\nBut for my money the worst thing about most four one K. plants there's a lot of control over your money\nAnd the lack of choice of what you can invest in a way that the best way to invest as you know is to buy diversified portfolio individual stocks do homework and each one so that well you know when it's time to buy more when it's time to sell and when it's not as ... which is very rare but so here's my role for entire investing\nIn Syria as much money are four one K. as needed to get the whole company match and then stop right at that point they'll put another penny in your four one K. at least not until you max out your IRA contributions\nAll right so there's an interesting take so he says fees hurt your returns the lack of choices hurts your returns and you should use your ... up to the match and then stop and then put the rest and an IRA so Virginia what do you think about that advice do you agree that he is sort of agreed you disagree what do you say\nWell I think I Would sort of agree ... clients ask us this numerous times about okay well I don't have onto his ... and that kind of thing and I and I don't really have a lot of control over it\nWell and I put it in but the truth of the matter is that a four O. one K. is one of the best vehicle for putting the most money away every year because when you have a traditional Iran or off\nYou can only put sixty five hundred dollars a year or excuse me\nFifty five hundred dollars a year if you're under the age of fifty and then and then you get a thousand dollar catch that sixty five hundred if you're ever the age I'm fifty but\nUm that you know that's not a lot of money to put away if we're going to really be adamant about retirement and and starting starting early in the I guess that's the way that maybe you can put\nAn end you know you can't put away in in the in the early years that we get to the years after the kids are gone and wave in I mean we really got to start putting more away whether it be and a four O. one K. if we can put more or less and I put it in the four one K. because look at that tax deduction\nOn if we can ... you know Eighteen thousand dollars or a or twenty four thousand I Believe the fear of an age of fifty in that four one K. and we can really knocks it out that\nWhere I Want to go because you can put that much\nMuch more money and with the tax deduction there so that's just something to look at I\nThink that it's a\nWhat has it by says I don't think it's a blanket it by for everybody because there are different views on different cases and things like that but\nI think you know usually if it's a matter for one can unless there's just some her some horrendous for all and K plan that's just charging out the while do then we want to um probably maximize that if we can\nWe look at that rain we give people when they're when they're still working we give them bringing their four one K. statements forget we also get a copy of their paychecks things actually how much is going and\nGet the four oh one K. statements see exactly what the employers matching we look at the fees built in four oh one K. he's right Kramer is right to a degree a lack of choice in search of returns there that's one of the drawbacks of four O. one K. is you're limited to the bucket of\nDifferent mutual funds that whoever the four oh one K. provider is is offering you actually your employer picks them but\nThe the book is that the the mutual funds that you can say but when we look at people's for one case which we don't handle foreign but we do get Virginia guilt does a great job of breaking down with the fees are\nAnd see what the different fees are in each one of the mutual fund options and taking some of the lower fees the Mitch lower fees and typically have a better return uh that's something we can give them advice on getting them ready to move forward\nBut life a genius in most cases we're going to recommend max and putting as much in the four oh one K. as possible I talked to a client this morning\nThat we're looking at what she was doing she had been convinced by someone who sells products on a payroll deduction basis as she balls on this costing her a hundred dollars a month well that's twelve hundred dollars a year\nBut duplicated some other things that she was buying and some other things that the employer was already providing for her we said stop it divert that hundred dollars a month into your for all three baby and beef up your for all three big contribution 'cause you don't need this thing that you just vault\nSo it was a you know they're all kind of little tricks like you said and and the sect of the segment for this is a lot of little things that add up to the big things especially when we get in the red zone toward retirement\nSounds as if if you're not a disciplined person who will Kramer is talking about you have to be very disciplined you have to say OK my employer match is three percent so that's going to equal to this so that will get me up to about ten thousand dollars to now I've got\nFourteen thousand dollars that I can put someplace else so I've got to make sure I take that fourteen and do that because if you don't then you really are losing out aren't you Virginia\nThat's right yeah and that's what you gotta make sure you're calculating correctly and making sure that your maximizing all that you can't", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "year": "2018", "city": "Mobile", "day": "06"}
