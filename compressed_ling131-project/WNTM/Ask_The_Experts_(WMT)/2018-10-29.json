{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "You listen to the Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly Bennett and uncle Henry on these talks before nine W. B. U. V. in Biloxi\nHandle news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the dragon mobiles Suzanne lines coming up before we get to the news headlines who want to talk to bills for NBC\nNews radio national correspondent bill good morning\nGood morning uncle Henry ... want to get like\nGood morning now the um the shooting in Pittsburgh over the weekend I'm not I'm I'm unfortunately I'm used to stories about mass shootings but bill ... I felt a little caught off guard that it was that it was directed at the Jewish community even though I Know there's a long history\nOf anti Semitism in the world and we know the horrible things that have happened I just didn't think that we had something like that in this country\n[noise] [noise] yeah well there has been an increase over the last couple of years in twenty six team the FBI reported a a thirty five percent increase in anti Semitic crimes are twenty Seventeen there was a fifty seven percent increase in the incidence so uh it really is something that has been on the uptick\nAnd when you look at the over the past several weeks we've had that shooting up in Louisville, Kentucky that it's now been declared a hate crime\nOr the the packages last week that could be considered political ate a then you get this abhorrent incident over the weekend it really brings to the forefront once again that there are many different issues that bring out the hate and different people in different organizations across the country\nA and there's one estimate that there's many a thousand hate groups out there\nA coast to coast ranging from anti immigrant anti gay to black nationalist white supremacist to all across the board\nA show there is an awful lot of hate out there and I really think that and it played a part in the Pittsburgh shooting as well social media not the reason for these things but they certainly is a factor in all of these things because\nNumber one this social media platform gab dot com that this uh uh Bowers guy was on I had never even heard of\nBefore and uh your number one you can get your views out there anonymously number two you can find like minded individuals and you can\nEncourage each other and and that could become an inflammatory situation and the third part of it is these are all hot button issues that foreign entities had pulled our social media with a Russian meddling having to do with race issues in this country and racial bias religious bias immigrant issues they ... they\nPoke at all of these things to try to inflame us here in this country and you know what I'll go Henry it's working\nWell the a and you mentioned social media so are you speaking from the standpoint that these groups or people that have had these opinions have always been out there but it's now so much easier for them to find each other\nAbsolutely a number one to get your views out there whereas before al yeah you could get a Yankee grab a bullhorn and go to a street corner or a ... but\nNow I mean all you have to do is go on and apparently this gab dot com or was a website that while they their uh their approach was freedom of speech it'd it'd denigrate it into a hate site uh that uh interactive people who wanted to get their messages have hate out there\nSo you can get your message out there very easily and find other people who feel the same way\n\nSo are there any effort underway to maybe put an end to this particular side have you heard anything in that regard\nWell it's down now or whether it will come back remains to be seen it would be hard to believe that uh that they could justify coming back on especially if it generates the same type of talk that it that it has and again\nUh I for one it never even heard of it before this uh so it's down now I Would imagine it probably will not come up unless they they might bring it back up under a different name or something just to just to do that but\nIf if this was one we don't know about that's out there how many others are there\nWill will build super you you mentioned um these estimates of how many hate groups that are out there and I'm sure the definition is going to vary from from person to person and also from who's doing the counting what about ... what about the government do does the government keep track of what they consider hate groups\nWell what the yes they do a and homeland security uh watches this as well as the ... the intelligence agencies and the FBI and in fact the FBI\nAnd it's interesting to me that they have only been tracking hate related crime since Nineteen Ninety two are and what they show as well as we hit an all time low and twenty fourteen since then since twenty fourteen the last four years uh we've been on the increase and uh so there has been a trend going up word\nNot only in this country but worldwide I mean when you look at Europe when you look at South America and when you look at the middle east you look a lot of different areas where this is also on the increase maybe for some of the same reasons is that it's happening here uh but uh but this was not a trend just it's just exclusive to the United states\nAnd and really when you look at it\nUh these type of issues in this country have been around for a long time I mean when people were emigrating in the in the early Nineteen hundreds and you know certain ethnic groups whether it'd be the Italians are the Irish or the Germans ... weren't allowed to live in certain areas of cities and things like that it's been around for a long time\nOr it will build for um [noise] it it's it's yeah it's been around for a long time and it seems like something very hard to combat\nYeah almost impossible uh other than a a a dramatic change in social attitudes and uh that is something that may never happen I you know it really is very difficult\nWhen we're out of time build super thank you for your time today You're welcome uncle Henry [noise] their egos bills in for NBC News radio national correspondent\n[noise]\nWe have

of any sort of light 'em in hurricane products typically blocked polite\nUm you know so you and you have to pay the ... hurricane implement down after the storm so it then it gets people to have an impact window that hit the brakes it's covered by the warranty and\nIf you can open this window and get ventilation end of the home after the hurricane when there's no electricity and and you're not busy taking down hurricane implements or on ladders trying to get hurricane implements open what whatever but\nYou know we have a very a very um rigid hurricane window I have an impact window that that is you know again it's they county approved a um and it's you know a fantastic product\n[noise] you know and again uh if you're interested in the other products for hurricanes window world has a full line of\nOf hurricane grade shutters vinyl shutters of fabric panels all of that so if you have something in mind they certainly can help you out with that and show you the pros and cons of each of these things but as George said I'm\nThe best product is probably going to be that impact window before we move off the top and the recent bringing this up now is because I I I'd mentioned that I'd in February of last year already window where I was getting calls about a hurricane products and I know this is something that people may think about\nOver the next couple of months and they may want to implement something before next hurricane season so before we leave the topic George talk a little bit more about the impact windows you say that they are ah they're Dade County standard so these these windows can take a tremendous amount of punishment\nDo a ... a you know that they they they test that they go through for that for that certification um they fire a two by four I'm Out of an air cannon into these windows and\nThere was a there was one of the task that ... act or multiple blows by this they still don't penetrate the window I'm you know and as you said there are great products and and and there there are products out there if you if you have windows that are are um\nThat are efficient that are or doing you a good job then we can cover them with something like a fabric panel um we also offer downs um a a candy rode down from the interior of the home and a lot from the interior of the home um\nThese again these are\nThey're going to be seen from the outside and a lotta people don't like to have that yeah that is true said look\nWe do have you know products out there that that that that\nThat the arguing storm or security purposes for that matter um I Know we have a lot of customers down around Gulf shores and dolphin island that aren't aren't there through the winter I mean through the summer months um because it's warm up north\nBut when it turns cold in the wintertime they come down so a lot of these places are locked up for months in the summertime um and they use these hurricane products as a security they locked the windows and doors up and it's and it shut up but um\nWe do have a lot of products and we have had a resurgent so the the um the hurricane implement um you know that every body kind of watching out now so\nWell and I I remember you talked about watching uh the weather channel and and wondering if those were your windows that had survived and some of these things you were saying I also noticed in watching some of the coverage that there were there were some homes near the water\nThat had been built to withstand hurricanes and they had one house that\nWas the only house standing in a neighborhood because it was built to all these very strict standards but they still have damage in the house and the reason they still have damage in the house is because the windows broke\nYeah I mean that that's that's a proven fact I mean it it air into the house it it you know that's when it goes you know I'm so these doors and windows that we sail that are that are that are hurricane you know\nRated uh is is I mean and if you live south of that and you got to have it and that's just that's just in a nutshell um if we we we do a great business I'm with the Mississippi Alabama and Florida go they'll goes with the uh\nYou know
