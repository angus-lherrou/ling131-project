{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "\nListening to golf has mornings with Kelly Bennett and uncle Henry where our news talk one in four nine ... seats and these radio seven ... and Ninety nine find that than the jag immobile Web\nWeb news headlines coming up in ten minutes with the latest on hurricane Michael in those news headlines before we get to that we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent bill ... still good morning\nMy uncle Henry to Monica Monica Kelly\n... why why did Nikki Haley resign\n[noise] that is the question of the day I'll go Henry I I mean the the reason that we're hearing is that\nUh she just wanted a break and actually told the president about six months ago that she was going to be stepping down now if you believe that uh is another question I mean they still this remains a clouded ... resignation coming from Nikki Haley that no absolutely nobody knew about\nIt came out of nowhere the reason remains unclear this morning in fact\nUh you would have thought that if this was indeed the case that you would have heard from other un ambassadors or you went on boys are employees that\nAre may have said yeah you know we we knew that she was thinking about it so it's really no surprise that she's stepping down right now we haven't heard anything like that\nOkay so uh what is her future a lot of people took a look at the way that she handled herself at the un yeah especially on the issue of of standing up for Israel and thought that this ... this would be a possible presidential candidate\nAbsolutely although uh twenty twenty is a is President Trump's year to run for reelection she has already said she is not going to do that in fact she's got a campaign with him a that would mean that her first availability would be twenty twenty four\nAh and it's hard to believe that\nShe would have that in mind and remove herself from the limelight or so that would mean that she would be out of the political sphere for the next six years waiting to run for president and I don't see that happening either so ah maybe she has another a political a\nSpot in mind and really the most logical thing to me and it's already been denied so\nBut hey denials had been reverse before and have proven to be untrue the most logical thing to me would be that as as we has been rumored President Trump\nDoes that department of justice house cleaning after the midterm elections removing Jeff Sessions as attorney general and replacing him with Lindsey Graham at that point you look around and you say gee who can we put in that Senate seat from South ... oh\nOh there's Nikki Haley and slide her right into that Senate seat from South Carolina that would make the most sense to me and would explain this whole situation but still you know Lindsey Graham is already denied that so I who knows that it remains the remains of mystery\nSo who takes place\nWell uh there are a couple of names that have been mentioned but I really think the inside track is held by Dina Powell who was a former White House advisor a former Goldman Sachs\nExecutive and or someone that would again be a a woman in the administration that President Trump needs a Nikki Haley was the highest profile woman in the administration\nSo a Dina Powell a I think has the inside track record ... who was ambassador to Germany is also a possibility but the president has already said I don't want to create another vacancy by moving him ah so I I if my money I ... know forget about avant garde right up my money's on the Nepal\nNow ah how how high profile is the UN ambassador job because I yeah I Know Nikki Haley made a lot of she made a big impression obviously there have been times in the past though where I Would have struggled to say who it was\nA they they you know I'll go Henry ... they we got we got our minds melding here because uh one of the questions I always had was a who was the last few on a bachelor\n[noise] [laughter] yeah when they get Haley yeah well you know who I remember his Jeane Kirkpatrick ... I think goes all the way back to Reagan uh so so yeah there's [laughter] yeah\nWell the answer to that question actually is Samantha Power who was are you on a basket or for forty years\nBut nobody remembers that Brian remembers Susan Rice who served for four years under Brock Obama a and you might think John Bolton served for a year who is no national security adviser a and if you go way back you're talking about people like John Negroponte bill Richard Senate Madeleine Albright uh well I'm just try to find when ...\nWho did you say who did you mention Kirkpatrick oh Jeane Kirkpatrick was [noise] how long ago was that [laughter]\nNineteen eighty one to eighty five\nYes yeah All right and I'm a Reagan guy\nI'm wearing a brownie points for history today on ... for sure I'm wearing a Reagan button\nYeah say it but you're you're right that Nikki Haley kind of elevated this position to a new level\nUh she was a tremendous representative of the United states at the un that was a she really delivered the Trump policy in the U.S policy to the rest of the world and maybe more than ... than anybody else ever did at the un\nAll right we'll bills for we're at a time thank you for your time today\nThank you very much and I don't know what I have another chance to talk about Jean Patrick so thank you\nVery [laughter] very wasn't that'll probably be my last time two [noise]\nWe can see 'em Googling that name later that's what's coming you okay we are we're at a time for this hour now coming up we've got all the\nNews headlines for yet of course came Michael will be covered in those headlines\nWe'll get back into it next hour if you want any other information you can go to our Web sites news talk one oh four nine dot com or news radio seven ten dot com or any of the heart radio station ... in are the key word storm watch and you can get all the info there [noise]\n\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute stunts are slipping in early trading as investors track a dangerous hurricane hurricane Michael is poised to be the strongest storm to hit the continental us since two thousand\nFour with a life threatening surge and the potential to ... billion in damage storm has already cut Gulf of Mexico oil production by forty percent and warnings and watches had been issued for the Atlantic coast as far north as the Carolinas my next crew this morning down seven ten Seventy four dollars forty five\nCents a barrel chairs of Sears or lower by\nThirty five percent and struggling retailer owned by hedge fund manager ... laying the groundwork for bankruptcy filing as soon as this weekend and the latest snapshot of wholesale prices shows again have to ... percent in September a month over a month matching projections down down Ninety four it twenty six thousand three hundred thirty three\nThe S. and P. five hundred lower by Fifteen or one half of one percent at twenty eight sixty five an insect down sixty six Seventy six Ninety One genus already Bloomberg\nWall on highway Ninety eight on Oprah loose Ireland and it's approaching the west bound Wayne which goes towards Fort Walton Beach\nObviously da da da da and pretty good shape even for those of you who may be waiting for the last minute now to get out in advance of the storm with time saver traffic I'm ready Romero\n[noise] Michael is on the move the major hurricane with sustained winds now as one forty five places it\nWell into category for strength should make landfall in northwest Florida perhaps near Panama City by early afternoon locally that means some occasional heavy rain banned then tropical storm force winds in mobile and Baldwin county\nWe will cool off tonight it's going to be a quiet run a leather starting tomorrow lasting through the weekend I meet ... Jake done from NBC Fifteen for this I heart radio station\nBottom of the hour breaking news had one news radio seven ten WINZ out mobiles and I urge radio station Ninety nine point nine W ... three mobile [noise]\nThis is a Fox News alerts hurricane Michael churning ever closer to the Florida Panhandle I'm Dave Anthony is the most powerful storms ever hit that area with one hundred forty five mile an hour sustained winds gusts of one sixty five\nPlayed out a ... the market has kind of taken us well\nI'm ... and it's I'm guessing it's very similar that that people mail because the technology has gotten to where it is\nAnd it's more affordable for the president to have cameras so everybody businesses and and um resident you want the same thing they want a monitored security and they want cameras that wouldn't be able to see what's going on\nThan I Do that is correct are really not a big difference between what they want really other than a maybe the automation sides a little heavier on yeah residential side but that's actually going to be something that grows a lot on the business side as well because they want to start\nManaging their energy costs are being able to monitor more people or employees in and out of their business so it's going to catch up with it to last\nPrevention you know as far as uh customers coming in and internally\nNow CSI alarms in audio they are a local company even though they do business in a wide wide area they are local um and for people that have not heard you want to hear before why don't you tell people how this all started\nAll right well uh started in uh Nineteen Ninety eight and a pretty much two guys that were I'd consider is pretty broke a didn't really have much much between us and uh we just had an idea that\nWe saw an opportunity they'll security would would be a good opportunity for us and\nThe only way we could be known or get noticed we had no money for advertising so there was wasn't really any way to get you get her name out there so ah we just took debate in the streets in Ninety eight and a just of all over the years and and growing it from there you started with just me and him\nWho's very very tough a\nWay to get started that's for sure uh we we were able to develop with thick skin early on and uh the benefit of that we uh\nWe see pretty much ah all levels of the industry um as far as cells process goes and all different areas um we've been there\nAnd ah you know eventually came to the point where\nWe were started doing okay we're able to start hiring some people and just grew from there\nThere's a lot of competition in your industry uh we all see all the different companies out there that do home security monitored security ... again for new listeners that haven't heard you come on here before help us understand what's different about dealing with T aside alarms in audio versus some of the other\nReally big names and the security business under one difference is what we just talked about your local people ... that you're here or immobile what are some of the other differences between you and your competitors that\nThey even touched on that point you just said as huge as I'm sure everybody had to\nHad to call some large company at some time and ah it can be quite frustrating actually have to\nSet a portion of your day aside just because you know it's gonna be that way so at least if us you could call one number you talk to that person and we try to get taken care for you right then okay that's a huge plus for me [laughter] his for pay as well\nThey'll do what are the differences in the way you wear your philosophy toward contracts because I understand a lot of the other people in your industry sometimes they have these really long contracts a lot of times people don't understand what they're signing up for\nWe we do we have short term agreements 'em\nAnd part of our thinking behind that as well with if we can make you or if you're happy customer and\nYou know we don't go up on your monitoring we keep your right to same we feel like there's no need to to for someone for someone in to a long term agreement that to us that's kind of almost like you're telling semi or\nYou know this long term agreement just you know we went in there and\nYou're here you're here this long and we know after this time you're gone wrong and we don't want to think about it that way right\nYeah you are you have the whole most an opposite approach that you're you're ... you're really making sure that people want to stick with you and that's because you don't change by rate I signed up\nCouple of years ago with you you told me that rates now going to go up as long as I'm a customer\nIt it it is correct\nLast I add some some new technology if I add something that's that I don't have that could change it but if I don't if I just keep it the way it is I don't have to pay more in the years to come\nIn and it it it helps us too because if it does come to a point and say at customer does want to leave for some reason we can feel good about it that we know\nIt's not us and it wasn't anything like that that drove them off and you know some things certain people do you just can't change and it's a lot easier to move pass at that point\nNow can you if somebody has some other companies system are and they're at the end of a contract can you use that same equipment is is it a is that a simple process to transfer from one company two years\nI'm most stuff out there we can use easily the stuff that are maybe somewhat of an obstacle is ah for the most part maybe antiquated equipment and we need to get them something new or\nAny way that it's probably not going to work with maybe the modern stuff they might want to do any how\nSome people may not want to use the old equipment but if they do I would say nine out of ten times were able to\nTo ... is very it's we're in and out within an hour I'm very simple uh normally we would just take over exactly what you have a we just send a Senate term monitoring station\nAnd if there's any and all and you want to change we do it at that point as well\nAnd in a lot of times with the older equipment some some\nSome customers think that hey you know I've got this old equipment I Want to do to do all these things and they think that right away I've got to replace everything well\nThere's some some of the things that they may want to do we make can achieve that even with the older equipment we may have to add a little bit more up to date technology to that system that we make and make some of those things happen with what's in place\nWhere it's so so a lot of the differences are that your contracts are shorter than a lot of your competitors\nLike less ... shorter agreement\nAnd and the the price the monitoring rate is not going to go up at all as long as I keep the same equipment and don't add on new technologies\nUm and most of the time they will save money with us actually OK radial even lower okay that's a ... irate generally a\nFraction of what a national company would charge\nAnd for us to come out and look at your system take it over there is no charge for that\nLike a mark was saying the only charge would be if you want to add some additional stuff at that point but basically you can have us come out take your system over for a charge me the first months monitoring a you're going to have a lower agreement short term\nAgreement and you're better off every way and you get ill or someone locally\nAnd um I didn't realize this until I signed up with you that I get a little bit of this kennel my homeowner's insurance because of monitored security\nDoes corrected uh it it helped they [noise] they they have figured where someone with the security system as being monitored a police fire paramedic come out than it saves them in any a potential losses they may have on the insurance side so they passed that savings on to the homeowner\nI'm not I'm not going to say I'm thrilled with my phone rang him texting thirty pounds a day with service issues yes I Would much prefer to their customers do call my office so we can efficiently take care of them but I Want to bring the point that how many national companies can you take the local guys and say I got an issue can you get this taken care of for me well\nYou know that's that's another big I added value because typically if you do for national company\nYou're going to be calling on eight hundred number and I think they load the convenience of the fact that they can do that really easy\nYeah that's a that is a big big plus ... you know where you you know where the company is and you know that their local people there and you can deal with them\nWe're going to take a quick break and we're going to get him more in depth on actual security systems what is available for people these days with all the new technology will get into that next\nWith CSI alarms in

S. I. alarms an audio dot com\nOn it one thousand dollars now [noise]\nOr if we go cloud storage most likely we want to\nThey need to be one of our customers because that's going to\nA lay on top of the security\nWhen we add the video or if you were to add a couple of cameras that how we would do it for you we would put those on the backbone of the security and they would have cloud storage but let's just say ... similar situation you want to cameras and you did not have security with us at that point would probably want to talk to you about doing an end\nAnd that type system it'd be a better better fit for you know it sounds like a lot of options but once we can\nFill you out what you're looking to do what you want it to do that it's it's pretty one direction of yeah what we think you should death if I'm In a hundred situations I'll scratch my head on one or two maybe to just say what way do I need to go on this and really have to kind of map it out in my head\nBut that's not very often that we run into that there's a few questions I guess we can qualify which direction\nWe rent will recommend for you\nOkay I've got a few more questions or cameras but we've got to go to a break for for weather and news and a few other things so we come back a little bit more on cameras and other things with the U.S side\nAlarms in audio look for CSI alarms in audio online by going to ts I alarms and audio dot com [noise]\nNow doubled you when GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC fifty's good morning I'm Jake done from NBC Fifteen of course\nMichael grabbing all the headlines and rightfully so the major hurricane now a category for with maximum sustained winds of one hundred and forty five miles per hour\nMichael should make landfall in northwest Florida not too far from Panama City by early afternoon locally will see tropical storm force winds and occasional heavy bands of rain in mobile and Baldwin county is temperatures climbing into the low eighties\nIt will be cooler but nice starting tomorrow I'm Jake done for this I heart radio station\n[noise]\nTend underpaid I'm Alone we knew it\nI wouldn't\nThousand dollars of every hour\nRadio seven ten WINZ em [noise] we do not\nShower for your chances of being and when I feel I mean it\nUsed to make it rain in front of your least favorite co workers driven by ...

do home security for me and also\nA do audio and video for me we may get to that before the end of the show where we were talking about cameras in the last segment of the program and that is just what is that what people when they meet you and find out what you do for a living is that what they ask you about cameras\nI mean I get asked I mean we get asked I Know I get personally asked more about cameras and undo anything\nOf course absolutely we all want them\nAnd say more recently asked people is the audio side they're like oh I never I didn't know you guys did that I'm like well you know the name of my ...\nAnd we fix a lotta we're fixing more and more adding upgrading more and more in a way to audio equipment ah oh yeah\nOkay All right well we'll have to get into that and it ended up coming segment before we're at a time on on the topic of cameras though\nUm [noise] how different is the installation part of that because the cameras need power mhm so do you connect into how do you do that\nThere is some that there are a few different options one would be yeah there are traditional cameras that need power and\nBest options in technology available with the with with those cameras or the next one is cameras that can get on your wife five but still need power right ah and then there's the third option which there are cameras that or\nI put them in the same category there's some battery operated one which we don't want that no I mean I don't want to charge cameras up so my customers don't it's not really I I don't want to customers don't admit they that to do ... mindset and
