{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "\nYou're listening to Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly\nAnd uncle Henry new software for nine WVU V. in Biloxi\nAnd news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the dragon mobiles wherever news headlines in\nTen minutes for you right now we want to welcome to the Gulf Coast mornings national correspondent bills for building morning to you\nGood morning uncle Henry them on how you doing\nWe're doing great ah so\nThe story that top story in the country right now all these mysterious packages what is the latest\nWell the latest is they they are making progress and probably more progress than authorities want us to know about at this point but the latest is that yeah things are kind of centered on a postal facility in ... Florida just north of Miami\nThey say now that at least several of these packages that ten packages that have been discovered now\nTravel through this facility which has a a packaging sorting and processing facility which is a huge\nPostal operation but this is a big development because they can now a track the movements of these packages and maybe even get back to the point of origin which could lead to a video surveillance of who may have actually put this package\nIn the mail to begin with their even self service kiosks at this facility uh there were people can drop packages so all of those things will now be examined and could lead to the people ultimately responsible the other part of his uncle Henry is\nThe devices themselves continue to be analyzed at the uh terrorists explosive device analytical center down in Quantico and\nUh at this point there appears to be more evidence or getting a lot of reports that these devices would not have gone off that are they in some cases contained pyrotechnics element like out there might be anything from a gunpowder to a phosphorus to\nA solver based type of substance but uh there was no apparent triggering mechanism meaning that ah they're yeah they they could have been dangerous but there's nothing there that would have made them go off\nBuilds up or is it likely that there are other packages that haven't been found yet\nAuthorities say we have to be wary of this and we had some false alarms yesterday or last night that building that CNN and his and in New York City was a part of it was evacuated again where they thought it was a false alarm\nThey say there may still be more out there even though it's been twenty four hours now ah and that they say they must be considered viable explosives that they are potentially destructive devices even though as I said the evidence seems to be mounting that these would not have gone off\nSo we've uh with the twenty four hour news networks you get a few facts and then you you're left with twenty three hours of speculation\nYeah a has any of the is any of the speculation a ban on target to or I've heard the interesting theory or that it could be a foreign entity\nYeah I I think that has to be considered here especially due to the fact that this could be considered another form of election meddling so to speak and we've heard a lot about that through social media and such\nBut does this could be considered another form of that just to throw the whole process into a little bit more of mayhem and\nTo fuel speculation on both sides whether it be a Republican or Democrat or right wing or left wing fuel a speculation and rumors on both sides as to who might be responsible for this and to create more of a divide a than we already have in this country between between the political parties\nSo I think that that is a viable explanation I'm sure it's something that the authorities are looking into\n\nSo bills in for you you mentioned that there's a lot to the authorities know and they're probably not letting us know yet or is there any any timeline that we can count on should we should we expect this to be resolved a week from now\nThis is also interesting uh I Believe that the investigation is ... is progressing quick enough that we could have a an arrest some time and the next week or so but there is now some speculation uncle Henry that if there is an arrest made that\nThat tales of it would not be released until after the midterm elections\nAre so as not to fuel a the the ire of one party or the or another or to damage or either party before the midterm elections now that is completely a unsubstantiated at this point but it it's certainly something that a is an interesting aspect of this whole thing\nWell and that's something that I also wondered about because certainly or if there's an indication that that whoever did this he's leaning really hard in one direction or the other politically um the the opposing sides going to want to make the most of that yeah\nEspecially to if this is I mean as we've heard some speculate that this was a democratic hopes that it actually is democratic supporters who wanted to create this situation in order to damage the Republican Party\nIs found out that that is the reason for this or it could have an impact on their mid term elections so yeah that's that's a question to keep in mind as we move ahead but I think this investigation is moving ahead fast enough that we could have\nA some action taken and the next week or so\nWhere we're at a time bills for thank you\nYou're welcome have a great weekend\nYou to go in for NBC News radio Kelly been at just imagine\nWe have all this going on a before the midterms can you imagine what it's going to be like in our next election for president\nWow yeah I and my thought process hadn't even got that far yet\nWhen I finished you're right it it is it is as chaotic as it's ever been before mid term I just a couple of years from now heading into that election my goodness\n[noise] maybe we'll be used to it by then huh [laughter] I Hope this isn't something we have to get used to [noise]\n\n[noise] this is

Fifteen Seventy two should do it today quite a few clouds this morning that those\nNinety nine point nine W ... three mobile [noise]\nThis is a Fox News alert it's up to a dozen suspicious packages now I'm Dave Anthony to more intercepted\nThis morning one sent to a democratic senator the other and ex Obama intel official turn Trump critic Fox's Rachel Sutherland does more live from Washington\nState for director of national intelligence James Clapper and democratic senator Cory Booker the latest charges targets in a string suspicious packages apparently intended for high profile Democrats and package address a Clapper was found that they said the second street post office in New York City and New York police source tells Fox News is similar to other packages\nCorrect and that's why we you know of course would encourage them to come in so we can give them a thorough evaluation and give them a diagnosis and then treated properly\nDoes eczema ever develop in adulthood or is it always something that starts in childhood [noise]\nYou know I mean eggs and my concern and any time but most of the time it does start in a in children but yeah we see adults that come in and you know they complain about hey you know my hands just started getting irritated my ankle started getting irritated you know adults can generally have eggs in different areas than children although there is no cookie cutter guide\nSo a lot of times these things just don't read the text books\n[noise] document I wanted to ask you about the research fix laser\nUm the different things you can do with the race or fix 'em is that something you can use to help people with scars\nIt is you know there were services are really neat piece of equipment because\nYou know now now many treatments are required to get improvement and scars or remove all fine lines of wrinkles because we're trying we're regenerating college and we're doing it very gently you know and the reason that we're doing it gently is a lot of folks today and our hustle and bustling world can't\nYou know stop and be off for a week or I Do and so now for those patients we've got a different treatment if they want quicker results they can do is yet to treatment but but that's the way what separates were surfing says it works well but it's a no downtime procedure\nNow the researcher fix a you mentioned it's it's I guess a little more gentle then CEO too so um what kind of the conditions can you treat with a researcher fix\nWell you know ... and wrinkles sun damage this coloration\nUm [noise] you know to name just a few and I think that those are probably the ones that that most people want to or have improvements and and then of course just get a general useful glow to their skin and that's what when you are regenerating college and when you reach entering a last and\nThose are the types of things that we are going to expect to happen\nI Know probably a lot of people that are just getting to that point in their life when they wish they could make wrinkles go away they may never have thought that you could go to a board certified dermatologist and use lasers to do that\nThat's just something we don't ... ... years ago I did not hear about 'em I talk about the advantages of having it done in that way\nWell you know everyone wants to talk about this crane that can regenerate college in or this other procedure or a chemical pill or a facial and the bottom line is none of those can replicate the results you can get with a laser\nAnd the reason the laser is absolutely the best is\nRegardless of operator\nIt digs down in ... college in the same level no matter where you place it it's all about you know having a treatment that is\nVery um [noise] exact in what it does if you have a chemical bill for example even the best experience hands it makes sense that you're probably not going to have the same amount of peeling agent on the left cheek spot one\nVersus the right Jake spot one right right and that's kind of a poor man's or poor woman's way of trying to generate college and\nAnd yeah I was trained we did deep chemical pills for example we did Dharma abrasion and those things do or do work but they just don't work as well and they also have a much higher complication right\nUm you know and the reason that more people don't have lasers because they're just very expensive piece of equipment\nSo so there is a state of the art and and it sounds like a better outcome for the patients in that you mentioned less complications yes\nSo if somebody comes in for research fix let's say they they want to come in for a fine lines and wrinkles uh what is the experience like what does it feel like\nYou know they're going to film is like a little rubber band snapping against the skin I think that that's\nThat common analogy is useful here as well most lasers that's what we're always telling patients it's really just not that uncomfortable at all\nNow with the rest are facing and we can increase the energy and as you increase the energy you're actually treating a little bit deeper and as you increase the energy and you drill deeper can be a little bit more uncomfortable\nBut with topple numbing there really is no problems with excessive pain\nWhat is the one of the results like ... on something like fine lines in wrinkles with resurface\nLower a series of treatments over over time um you can see a nice improvement and phone lines and wrinkles and I think that also you know when you look globally you know you take a picture before you start\nAnd then a year later two years later you take another you take another picture and you look at those two side by side you know see a really nice improvement or reduction of finalizing wrinkles are reduction sun damage\nIn just under ... just a healthier skin whereas if you didn't do anything you would actually see the exact opposite right because the aging process even if you're someone who's taking better care of yourself in that space as we get a little bit older we get a little bit wiser\nAnd solve a sudden we're not much time as much time to get out in the sun like we were younger\nEven though we're doing the right
