M. and Ninety nine five FM the jag immobile\nWeb news headlines coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news we\nWant to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent bills for Bill good morning\n[noise] good morning uncle Henry go on and Kelly\nSo much for the latest on this Sarah ban that is headed toward the U.S Mexico border bills for\nYeah a ... and this has swelled to over four thousand people now and\nReally split into a couple of segments and we hear now there\nAre some people from El Salvador or joined in this march north are hoping eventually to get to the U.S border\nNow the president made some pretty big threats yesterday saying that he would mobilize troops to go down and seal off the border if he had to and also a take away aid from the countries where these people were originating from if those governments do not stop them so\nUh where we are today is it looks like we may have a plan here uh Mexico has asked the un high commissioner for refugees to intervene and help them at the southern Mexican border where some were told that some of these migrants are beginning to arrive at the southern Mexican border so what they're going to do\nA is a is set up shelters and processing centers along that southern border\nThose people who have valid visas will be allowed to continue on of those who want to apply for asylum or a visa will be able to do so there but it could take forty five days to process and those who are deemed eligible for asylum or a visa will be turned around and sent a country of origin\nOr so that's number one and the second part of this if someone\nManages to get around this system and continue on all the way to the United states Mexico will allow them to be turned around and sent back whereas right now the United states has to house those people until their cases could be adjudicated in this country so\nAre there some changes here the un involvement and it looks like Mexico is cooperating it a little more and our secretary of state is going to be down there today\nOr to try to see how everything is going and and what he can do to help\nBuild semper ... we need to get to the wind here because this is a very different response from Mexico especially than we've seen in recent years in fact I remember going back ten years or more there were government officials in Mexico they would say publicly that they believed that people have the right\nTo migrate wherever they wanted to on the continent\nAnd and so this is very different from even just a couple of years ago this attitude of the Mexican government\nEven really a different from what happened last spring when we had a similar migration like this in the past ... Mexico has issued what they called humanitarian transit visas and then migrants were given the option of seeking asylum in Mexico or continuing on to the United states\nAre now uh they're going to be stopped now they may be given asylum in Mexico but uh I think the message is\nIf you had on to the United states or you have a you have the possibility of being turned around and sent right back\nUh so I think the reason that we're seeing this renewed cooperation well we just had the trade deal agree to between the United states and Mexico and president Enrique Pena Nieto a who is only in office for another five weeks I think wants to continue cooperation with the United states as long as he is there\nNow when the new president comes in Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\nOr he may be a little bit tougher here however already a spokesman for the incoming government has said they will cooperate with this plan\nThat Mexico wants to put in place right now but down the road\nThere was always a possibility that Mexico could revert to some of its earlier policies\n\nOrange so builds up from where are they now are they add the Mexico border the southern Mexico border yet or are they still have a ways to go\nWell where we understand that some have started arriving at the southern Mexico border and now it's\nA ... some of these people are on foot some R B ... being given ... we've seen pictures\nAnd videos of just people stopping with a flatbed truck and allowing people to jump on board so some of those people who may have gotten a some kind of transportation are beginning to arrive at the southern Mexican border now\nOthers are said to be as much as Andrea fifty miles away so this will be almost a steady stream of people coming in\nTo the Mexico border probably over the next week or so and I think there there may be another possibility that maybe as these people hear about this move by Mexico maybe they'll turn around I you know who who knows but I Would think that uh the UN involvement as big in this\n... pay bills for thank you for your time today\nThank you very much uncle Henry I have a great weekend you to enroll tied\n... thank you for that thank you for that [laughter] bills or for knows what makes me happy\nOr ... yeah and then he squeeze that and that was great\nBut we're we're almost out of time here in this segment of one of ... time again I'm Kelly Bennett tell people again where you're going to be tomorrow morning\nI Am going to be on the black sea town green I'll be there real early I think registration actually starts at eight o'clock for the making strides against breast cancer walk but I'm\nJust come out and join us into dance sun and fundraising for the Cancer Society we really want to get rid of cancer that's really what it's all about and we want to have a good time it was very many the weather's been so nice right right you not want to go out and do a walk this\nWeekend you're probably looking for something to do outside anyway this is a great that will\nBe at Havana raise cigar shop in lounge twenty three fifty one airport boulevard and midtown mobiles this evening a little after six o'clock playing ball through will be there for the grand opening looking forward to that thank you for listening to Gulf Coast morning [noise]\n\nThis is a Bloomberg Markets minute stocks are rising in early trading rebounding from yesterday's sell off as the latest round of earnings provides evidence of corporate strength the down a hundred and sixty at twenty five thousand five thirty nine ...
