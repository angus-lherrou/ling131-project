up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not\nJust the military it's economic it's diplomatic\nUh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're

country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates um be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there\nUm and unless something dramatically

and I always radio station Ninety nine point nine ... three immobile\nNeal buddy one I'm Pam who sounds Fox News a billion dollar deal over happens next week [noise]\nBillion dollars worth of dreams skyrockets to one point six billion there's no one matches all the numbers for the mega millions jackpot\nBut when she was looking at one of our suppliers catalogs and she brought some of those into the shop as well as some new jak pieces\nOh yeah I saw the jak pieces online yesterday on the mobile bay coins and ... a fine jewelry Facebook page so anyway um I just had to ask about those now I'm sure it was such an interesting thing that you sold out of them so quick\nTell us some of the things that have come into mobile bay coins and fine jewelry uh recently did a really cool items new items there\nWe have a lot of very unusual things like we mentioned those pieces a jury that Anna you know picked up those were very unusual very interesting role rose gold is extremely popular right now\nAnd rose gold over sterling silver makes it a reasonably priced item in it's very affordable rose gold\nThe gold is ... is a metal is an element there it's bright yellow and it's natural one hundred percent pure gold condition however you can aloe yet you can combine it with other metals fourteen ... gold for example is only about fifty eight percent gold the rest of his other stuff\nSo depending on what that other stuff is you combine it with you can change the color of people talk about yellow golden white gold\nWell if you add more copper and a couple other darker metals to that gold aloe or you can make it a rose gold color almost pinkish and design huh\nOkay very interesting and a little different yeah and a lot of people like different so when ... you know they're in the catalog she ordered some of those those are at the shop I'm not sure quite yet if she's put those on display but they are available if you come in and ask for those\nOkay so are there cool items I interrupted you\n... them and then we picked up a couple of more of the uh the trade dollars with the chop marks that you and I looked at a couple of weeks ago so we had one of those now we have three everything from about an circulated to\nA much lower grade one so those were very cool run just got out a bunch of new silver dollars which were really nice and some Carson City pieces\nUm he's actually had a wide variety of things from Lincoln sense too large sense\nDo some bus halves so quite a variety of coins coming into the shop and available for sale and also a lot of meant and proof sets now those are about the lowest price they've been in years and years and years so we've actually seen an upsurge of people coming in since the prices are so inexpensive\nThey're trying to fill holes in their collection and stock up on some of those in round at the end of the collection\nSince says meant and prove sets are so inexpensive right now\nRight now I'm a big issue this before and I want to ask you again we're we're in October Yes sir I Know that there are a lot of industries where the twenty ninth teams will start arriving anywhere between summer to the end of the year previous\nDo you have bullying items that do the same that twenty nine teams will end up showing up in your shop before we get to the end of the year\nMatter of fact very soon we actually have the queen's beast falcon that just came out that's the latest released and the queens beast series mad is actually a twenty Nineteen release even though we already have those there at the time so that is that's how they sort of stage those out so it's ready for twenty nine and is there a little bit ahead of the game\nThe ... already come out with the the new year of items and we're actually getting ready to order some of those I think\nTwenty Nineteen is the year the pig if I'm not mistaken so we're going to have some big points out there hey coin Yasser Arkansas Faye almost almost bacon ... you know sort of the predecessor to bake and you've got to get the pig first do have this year the coins there should be coming in fairly soon as well\nA Great Britain has the britannia went out silver billion piece just like the American silver eagle that's coming out early so we should have some of those in as well if I'm not mistaken I think it's the end of the very end of October when we'll be getting those in and with those is going to be the third and the route sixty six series\nSo that's coming out as well and that's again that's not necessarily twenty Nineteen item right it'll be tagging along with that order and that'll be the the Kansas\nPeace so I'm looking forward to seeing that come in\nYou have taught me that the silver egos as possibly the most popular bullying item in the country right and that they met them to demand they do so when did they start ... them to demand for twenty eight T\nBasically near the end of the year I'm not sure the exact date when they do that but they go through a shutdown process near the end of the year end of December where they're not mentioned in producing those anymore they're getting ready to tulip in Europe for for producing the twenty Nineteen silver eagles and usually it's about the third week in January when the twenty ninth teens are available\nAll right so um it's it's there's always something new pumping in\nThere certainly is and like we said it's it's pretty much daily and and I love for people to come by daily and check things out but that might be a little much for the time I once a week once every couple of weeks because if you don't do that or if you don't talk to us and let us know what you're looking for you're probably going to miss out on it we have things come in that never actually get to the cases\nBecause we know we have customers looking for those they get sold before anybody gets to see them other than that one person\nWe're going to take a quick break and come back with more here on

M. as the expert with Angelo of mobile bay coins and find jewelry [noise] twenty two for governments straight in midtown mobiles [noise] we get into some some real basics in this segment of the program I brought up American\nEagles in the last segment asking Angelo about what time of year or they're going to be getting in twenty nine teams of of of that ah when did they stop ... to demand all that kinda stuff angel or the definition of what is the exact definition of a boy you know how to it's going to be made out of a precious metal\nIs going to be an item made out of precious metals gold silver platinum or palladium\nAnd it is going to be bought and sold based off of the market price we always talk about being this spot\nPrice of that metal so that is going to be the baseline for the item is being sold\nWhether it's a dollar over spot or a hundred dollars over spot it's tied to that metals market so when the metal prices go up the price of that item will go up equivalent lay if the prices go down the prices will go down to quickly as well wear a collectible ... may not change very much or possibly not at all when the markets change\nNow or ... or ... issued by an official government sanctioned entity or could an individual or a private company creative bullied item\nAs a matter of fact most items are produced by private companies guy there's a lot of companies out there making ten ounce or bars hundred ounce bars thousand ounce bars even and those are not done by the government those are not done by the United states meant the United states mint does not actually produce the silver is using for Americans silver eagles\nIt purchases that from these private entities that are out there and those companies generally speaking I asked so nine thousand or nine thousand one certified\nWhere they have to follow the proper procedures and and qualifications to make the items to the government specifications and also the items that are going out into the private private sector as generic silver around your one ounce bars or ten ounce bars they have to meet some certain requirements to meet those quality standards but it does not have to be a government entity\nBombs but other than that I Can't really think of anything off the top of my head you've also got to remember too though that a lot of these countries we're talking about releasing those things have gold and silver assets within their country and we know that the middle east certainly has a lot of oil but I don't know about how much of the the metallic assets they have available to them\nWe're going to take a break we're going to get some some whether some news headlines and more and then come back with more questions for Angelo of mobile bay coins and fine jewelry [noise]\nTwenty two for governments straight in midtown we'll we'll look for them on the ... on Facebook just will promote ... on Facebook\nGulf Coast morning start with Kelly benefits and uncle Henry on use radio seven ten W.

coins and find jewelry twenty two oh for government street in midtown mobiles [noise]\nWe've talked a lot about precious metals already this morning we haven't talked about the fine jewelry aspect of mobile bay coins and fine jewelry [noise] when I use the term find jewelry explain what that means Angelo\nIt means that the jury we're talking about is going to be made out of precious metals now it may be mixed metals that could be sterling silver and fourteen care gold it could be a solid sterling silver\nSolid gold and we were talking about the carrots or sterling silver as opposed to nine nine find silver it just is talking about the amount of silver or gold that isn't a metal said what the percentages are so sterling silver is Ninety two and a half percent silver\nAnd then probably a little bit of copper maybe some other metals in there but primarily silver jewelry so it's not going to stay in your skin like a piece of copper would\nA Cochran nickel sometimes cause a lot of allergy reactions with folks so when we're talking fine jewelry you're much much less likely to have issues with those pieces of jewelry as opposed to a costume piece of jewelry made out of copper brass and then just plated [noise]\nThere are some people listening that have not been in to look at your jewelry can you describe your selection\nOverwhelming I think that would honestly be the first word that comes to mind when you walk in you see all these different pieces of jewelry and\nAll of those are unique different pieces of jewelry or if you go to the mall stores or if you go to the mall and if you can find a jewelry store I Know they seem to be closing left and right they have a lot of examples of joy they're really pretty\nBut a lot of them are the same thing just repeated over and over maybe with a different gemstones in them or larger and smaller versions of the same thing over and over again throughout the store you walk into mobile bay points and find jewelry and you look at that display of rings that are right there and every one of those rings is different and unique\nAnd you know\nYou could be looking at the suffering she could be looking at the gold rings and there's hundreds of different choices there well\nLet me let me ask you about the difference is because you brought up other jewelry stores so\nThere are lots of national chains and we see their commercials especially as we head into the end of the year you're going to see all these commercials sir or they'll have mass produced items mhm maybe connected to a celebrity\nUsually where the item is based on something in the ... the celebrities mama told them when there were a kid and they've got they've they've come up with some kind of a jewelry items on it\nUm explained to the listener how the pricing is different\n... when you have a national chain versus mobile bay conch and fine jewelry how is the pricing structure different\nIt's it's drastically different in that when we buy gold and silver items we base our pricing off of\nThe the metals prices and then we may base them off of the wholesale prices of the gym stunts that are in those pieces where when you're looking at a national chain they're they're paying a celebrity they're paying for that brandy and they're putting on some of those items and they're paying for this national marketing campaign they're putting out there\nAnd how are they paying for that by producing a whole lot of low cost but high priced items that they can pump out there under that particular brand and they can capture the profits from that we don't have those kind of profits built into any of these things so last year we had a collection of designer pieces come in at somebody was tired of\nThey were all very very well maintained beautiful pieces of jewelry we had our jeweler Tony who's on site go in and refurbishing the store those pieces to the original condition put those out on display one of them sold within twenty four hours\nOriginally it was a five thousand piece of jewelry five thousand dollars for that piece of jewelry we sold it for less than a thousand dollars\nOkay so that this jewelry originally was priced or five grand Yes sir because of all the factors you just outlined wrecked and but but you were able to to\nOffer a price based more on reality correct and somebody who's able to get it for a thousand dollars\nAnd that's one of those things that a lot of our customers have started to learn and ... and we've joked about it in years past\nA lot of this guy's especially we get into this mindset because we've been trained by these these big box stores when we're buying jewelry you are supposed to spend X amount right your budget you need to spend a hundred dollars for a birthday gift or five hundred dollars for this or\nTwo months' salary for that and you get get brainwashed into this idea of what it is you're supposed to spend or you have to spend\nAnd you go to the stores 'cause they're the ones telling you these things and\nThey find out how much you're going to spend and then they walk you into the pieces that are going to fit that\nA ... a year two years later you take this somewhere else and you find out that you've been drastically misled or is actually a huge news story over there in New Orleans about is a celebrity who is to drastically misled when he purchased a ring and then got it appraised I don't know if you've heard that story\nI had not heard that story but I Know you've you've come in you explain that because people don't understand that the way the pricing works that industry but a lot of times people come in to mobile by coincidence on jewelry and they're confused because the prices are certain so low\nFine says well and that's an opportunity another some a Christmas gift that somebody is it just stands out when you've had something in grave to some very\nI mean Christmas gifts there's actually some Hanukkah bars that Anna ordered in recently like I go and there's one with three puppy dogs on it which is very festive but not necessarily you know brandy in one direction or another so pretty much anything you want with those in grade school bars and rounds we probably have something that can fit your needs\nThen if you start looking I tell you what let's try to sort of do a virtual walks release where to start over ... station and you start walking up from Anastasia and look at an all the displays there she has some some very vintage cool pieces like some cameo rings cameo actually has a cameo ring cameo bracelet and cameo pending right now\nThat are very very unusual interesting designs and for people that don't know what a true shell cameo is it was when somebody took a piece of shell and carved through the outer layer of the show\nTo the inner layer it changes colors which is why you sort of have peachy colored background with a white or off white design on the front at the shell cameo where somebody carved through by hand it to create that this is a very interesting unusual pieces and cameras are actually done and other materials as well she has some of those there in the shop\nFor people that like the really cool ventured stuff\nShe has some of the old changed purses or old dance purses they recalled they're made out of sterling silver you\nPop 'em up and has a little spot for your dance card which was a big thing way back in the day has a little mirror she I guess you could check your makeup or check your face and make sure you can find and had a couple of spots for some change so when you were getting ready to leave\nYou could take a dime and go over to the pay phone and make a phone call or prior to that you could take a dime or a quarter and get a ride home that's showing you how far back those items yeah she made but very very cool little piece of history\nA we have a lot of those available in stock only one on display but probably a dozen of them available for people to look at\nBack when smoking was not shunned like it is nowadays they have some absolutely amazing sterling silver cigarette and say Grillo cases\nThat are very very beautiful designs including one that has a hand painted design on the inside that you would be embarrassed to see and you would probably be very upset as uncle Henry to look at that because\nThe lady is not wearing a whole heck of a lot but it was not good absolutely unbelievably beautiful designed to be painted on the inside of the of the cigarette case but the cigarette cases solid sterling silver so that is very cool and very different very evocative of a different time in our history\nA you start moving forward from that you can look at some of the sterling silver rings in earrings and bracelets and a lot of times people look at them and like you said they're shocked in disbelief that's only twenty nine dollars is a catch twenty nine dollars it's a sterling silver bracelet looks like a beautiful expensive gold tennis bracelet but it's not a sterling silver with some ...\nIt's basically thirty dollars so if you work for a while and love it that's great if you accidentally lose hope you don't but if it happens\nYou're not out thousands of dollars you're out less than fifty bucks so people love picking up gifts like that for themselves girlfriends boyfriends kids grandkids are all sorts of different silver rings I mean we have many many rings out there on display we have many more that are not out on display\nThen moving up into some of the ... pieces and those many of those are new items so we have the slider charms\nThat are very popular for both Alabama Auburn south Alabama ... we can actually get pretty much any charm that's in the SEC but we don't necessarily carry all of those and stock I'm also earrings we got the south Alabama jak earrings and necklaces in yesterday she can come out of the shop and check those out\nAnd then we have those those silver rounds and some some gold bracelets gold necklaces some very very beautiful gold earrings there in the front case\nAnd getting up sort of sliding over into the coin and encourage the side of things everything's from some beautiful Morgan silver dollars some old Confederate paper money from the you know from the Eighteen sixties obviously um we actually have some United States currency from the late Eighteen hundreds as well very interesting bits of history there\nA twenty dollar goal he says five dollar gold pieces we had a one dollar gold coin back in the day did you know that\nI didn't know didn't have a clue\nTiny little thing about the size of your your fingernail but very very interesting little little bit of gold there and you're like what the heck is that that's a dollar coin but so small I mean I lose it if I put it in my pocket it would probably fall out I'd lose the darn thing smaller than a dime but a solid gold coin\nUm you start looking at some of the coins we have on that side of things we talked about those trade dollars we have those ancient Roman coins that I Know you were very excited about the fact that you can hold a piece of history in your hand something that is two thousand years old and was actually money and worst something at the time is pretty amazing to me um I think you're like a lot of the silver\nDollars as well right ... absolutely do so a lot of people like the beautiful ones that are beautiful an circulated condition you can see all the details but I like the ones that are so worn down they the stories they can tell\nWe're gonna have to cut that we didn't get through a pad at the door yeah we didn't get get halfway through so a take a tour yourself mobile bay coins and find jewelry twenty two oh for governments street image immobile [noise] some of the stuff we've talked about you can see

gorgeous we do have a it's a different kind of cutter it's a double blade but a very unique looking a very nice heavy metal I'm normally retail you play pay forty fifty bucks for that cut her um\nBut

going to be probably\nA ... a ashtray it's about a hundred dollar retail ashtray\nUm but yeah they're they're known for their for their swag but we'll have something going on it's actually from six to nine pay six to nine but we always stay later than nine because people like to continue a enjoying a cigar and enjoying a an adult beverage\nAnd so it it's we're always there we're going to be open till uh eleven so guys still going to be going on\nAnd I'm Glad you mentioned the adult beverages at it and we haven't mentioned yet is that a Havana raise also has a full bar a with and talk about the ... you have a selection of beers\nOh we do we sure do um [noise] we've got about thirty different craft beers and obviously a cottage you'll package where we strive to be the best what we think immobile so at this location you know in most cigar lounges\nThey really don't carry that many craft beers mhm but because of our a store in West by Bill Cosby package\nYou know we we knew that we needed to do that and bring that uh west mobiles so we've got about thirty and actually yesterday we just added six more so I think we're looking at thirty six that should that probably will ramp up the next\nMaybe day or two or ... but we have a big following for craft beer and ah you know we're going to continue that with a Midwest mobile and in midtown so\nYeah we're getting into that time of

I mean we're look I'm In Alabama fans of the corps but you know hey we're eagle where you go to those people\nNow with the cigar sling or hear Billy Bradley so Tennessee utterly destroyed by Alabama do you have any recommendations on what would be the best Alabama victory cigar\nWell I can tell you this you know they have a tradition of Alabama does that after a victory whether they're on the road a are at Tuscaloosa at Bryant Denny\nUh they smoke victory cigars the players and the coaches in the locker room even if it's not allowed on school property they still fire up now the cigar that

authenticity they're ... they're now if if somebody didn't want to use that cigar ... what would you recommend is there is is there a cigar that has some kind of a triumph of atmosphere to it\nWell mainly it depends on uh the cigar smoker everybody's palate is different riot depends on whether you're a an occasional smoker or you're a seasoned smoker uh\nSo we what we have mild medium full body

to the event God's out there you know you need your good weather and and the right number of people to come and the right people to come together to make the event happen and it really happened for us last year\nIt's always been thankful that we've gotten to have a lot of the same people returning returning partners international wind was with us last year they're coming back this year and same with Land Rover\nUsed project a couple of different people and um where an absolutely anticipating a you know an even bigger and better at it this year\nAgain that one on the river immobile dot com to go get tickets and Rebecca what does your ticket get you [noise]\nSo it gets you in the gate it gets you on you will receive a souvenir wine glass uh that you get to take around and I mean it made him glass so it's not just a little plastic cup an experience as a part of the things that where you get some you know it's over two hundred different types I Want to say I counted the left it was pretty extensive\nIs extremely expensive so there's something there for everybody\nAnd you get a passport booklet that are seen as around the world said there's wines and bears from a little bit of everywhere there's some that are more semi regional like Pensacola something out of Birmingham too\nUm but then winds is I mean as far as the ... you really want to go away to try different type of wine and so as you come in you get the glass you get the same playing um\nPassport booklet thinking mark off your favorites remember to buy him at the store or trying to restaurant in town\nWe're gonna have some food vendors as well yeah we have on some really great they'd vendors this year um and now we're testing my memory if I can remember all of them well we have plenty of and there's only started these days so yeah I'm literally thing\nYou can find out at one of the river immobile dot com so tell us a little bit more I Know you're going to have a lot of ones there and you can't talk about all of them are are are there some want you to point out now that we should have our our eye out for\nA man that that's tough for so many different styles that are going to be there um but yes there's actually some some fun winds that I think for some people that might not be serious wine drinkers or beer drinkers\nWe've got a few we call kind of like cocktail Spitzer's there's a handful them they are going to be in can packaging like Ramona\nIt's a it's a sparkling white wine with a little bit of grapefruit juice and they're just a little bit of residual sugar\nStill very easy to drink and not a sugar bomb 'em but some unique style packaging and cans and we've got some Spitzer's at a really popular over in Europe right now I'm so I think we've got about three or four different styles of of those little wind Spitzer's um that are that are that are a blast\nUm but then really we got Washington state represented Oregon\nUm you know California as well I'm One of my favorite little producers on out of a France some in particular burgundy's out there be show so we'll be showcasing some of the ... and ... and ... days of from that particular producer\nNow it's called one on the river is they're going to be anything else to drink other than one yet\nSo we got some said so we've got some beers that he'd like she was saying that can be represented locally from Pensacola Bay brewery I'm obviously over in Pensacola and from red hills I'm up in Birmingham and then we got a few other ones ... mattered in between there and then like I said then we've also got those\nSparkling kind of cocktail drinks that are unique and social is another one which is a rice based Psaki on alcohol was all organic USDA certified\nUm that's just a unique kind of mixture as well to to keep people interested because not everybody's gonna enjoy the wine and beer and obviously going to enjoy the park so we wanted to throw in a few other things just in case you're answer your grandma your husband\nIsn't super high on those things they'll have a few things to sneak away and and try for themselves\nNow some listeners may never have gone to a wind event or wine tasting is there any special etiquette they should know about\nIt's funny you say that yes there's some some fancy etiquette which\nSometimes you're getting really fancy wine tastings you know try to keep the cologne in the perfume to a minimum\nBecause as the person next to you is trying to you know sit there and wine and smell the air um addicts if that person next to you has a lot of cologne or you know perfume on them you'll smell Chanel number five instead of the the blackberry under tones to the cabernet um\nSo if I wanted to I couldn't stop people if I detect an axe body spray\nEvacuate if you give them an ax have\nWaited for years I have a legitimate reason to stop people from wearing ... right right so um what about ... I'm sure that that's one of the things people ask you every day of your life is food burials with wine can you give us some basic just some basic education on that\nYeah so some basic things remembers you know ... with food pairing is you know red wine always go with red meats and white wines generally go you know ... with white meats you know\nBut that's very basic but when you start expanding from there I think one of the key ingredients as your company and who you're drinking you're wine with\nBecause you can have a nice bottle of wine and the nicest you know slap cheese but if you're by yourself in the corner eating and drinking it it's just not quite as special to be able to enjoy that with your friends and family you know in in loved ones\nThen you take the combination of what's the setting you know ... being outside being with your friends there's really no rules as if you're spending your own money you know on a ticket to come to an event or spending your own money on food and wine if you enjoy it\nThen that's your perfect pairing but the only way to ever find that out is to get it get out there stick their neck out there and try new things try a new wine with you know chicken ... or try this new cheese with you know with this red wine so it's all about experimenting and having fun\n[noise] okay so this is a had did you learn anything from last year Rebecca\n[noise] and they want and really just hit the nail on the head of that as as far as what I learned last year was ... you can beat him as not as wind drinker or someone who had been drinking wine for years in the media that said that in that you have the opportunity to\nSafely sample as many as you want really you know you can try on a variety of wine that you've never tried before and you might not want to spend the money at the store to buy a whole bottle but you get to learn some things and that's what's right with working with the guys\nIs that on one of our biggest questions last year when we just fell in love with this where can I get it\nAnd I essentially you find that wind section of your local store your grocery store your places like red or white and they can get it for you\n... and actually I wanted to expand on one thing really quickly when she said safely so when we do do tasty and like this they're called ... and not drinking so obviously you can drink the wine\nBut a lot of professionals and too if you don't have a lift or a designated driver there are spitting buckets there says you try the wind you can switch it around in your mouth and then spit it out because if you were to take one hundred or you know two hundred one out samples\nIt'd be drinking probably six seven bottles of wine so I always said to my people as a tasting and and not drinking\nYeah this is a this is one of those things where you have to really ... you know pick your spots correct you have to pick your spots because there's going to be somebody there\nUm what else ... you talked about the ones that Alabama likes are there any differences geographically from one part of the state of the other as to what type of ones where you live\nI mean yes but I think you have to look even more for the the micro climates within the state so as far as a southern state like Alabama compared to a state like Michigan is obviously even no mission and gets warm in the summer we get much hotter in the summer for a longer duration down here so crisp white\nWinds that are refreshing tend to sell a little bit more down here so whether it's up to you know ... whether you know what the the ... or some sharp nay styles you know do really well in the summertime that you don't really want to drink a big bold cabernet or ... you know by the pool or out on your boat in the middle of summer\nAnd reverse you know thing as well we don't get as cold here in the winter is a lot of other states as well too so regional whether differences come play you know a a pretty big impact on the style winds that are that are consumed during the those those time frames\nYou're listening to the Butterfield with international one craft beer before we're at a time with you a headache or we're getting close to the end of twenty Eighteen what can we look forward to next year in terms of one\n... wow that that's a great question um you know trying to wrap that up fairly quick you know quickly I think it really come is going to be coming down to you know a state driven wind\nYou know and I say a state driven winds that winds that are grown on the state of the winery there's lots of producers out there that are not brick and mortar wineries and they actually purchased a lot of their fruit\nAnd they don't make fake winds by any means that they're they're very real winds but it's not a brick and mortar winery so they can change every six months it can be wind ... minutes wind be and there's a lot of marketing\nBut you know whether you're in France or Italy or Spain these estate producing vineyards you know it is a special caption of that place in time\nFrom that hard work and I think as we talked earlier about the millennials as people get a little bit older and older older they want that piece of what the French called ... that sense of place why drink this bottle of wine what is it telling me about this this this area\nAnd sometimes it's difficult with certain wines 'cause it's just on the grocery store shelves and you pull it off and it's just basically a label there's no brick or more winery and it doesn't really tell you a story\nHave some wine and beer and some good food and um socialized a little bit\nThis is going to work out good now last year we did one on the river when Alabama was was headed by which they were off\nThis year it's the Tennessee game mhm so you watch Alabama score probably about forty five fifty point yet and then at halftime or after they've scored forty five or fifty then you can go to one on the river and and watch\nYou know just to the conclusion that I had another forty five or fifty yeah [laughter]\nBut we have\nSome great and when you think about a tailgate tailgate game from corn Holt and jump out gene guy laughs and seeing around there and the tell it actually positioned a\nSomewhat near our beer garden area which is sponsored by Robert spreaders and so we have an entire craft beer area set up this year so a guys and gals he loved the football love craft beer that's more of your scene there is absolutely a whole place it on the river for you this year\nOkay so uh before we go to break we're going to have some news headlines and some whether a Land Rover and jaguar tell us again some of the things we're going to be able to see from Land Rover and jaguar there one or the river\nYou are going to see like I said the amazing full size Land Rover range rover um the pinnacle of luxury we're also going to have our discovery it is built around being a great utility vehicle that can take you anywhere under the sun but still have an amazing comfortable ride in that true luxury feel\nWe're also going to see the convertible invoke that is it's only true convertible SUV out there\nOkay and again you decide to one of the reasons you wanted to get involved with this because if you project\nCorrect um job alert family definitely wants to be part of the community on a regular basis we like to be involved\nYou know we're just not people who sell cars we really and truly are part of the community we were all raised in this community we're a family there so we want to make sure that we're extending our family out into our community um it's a great environment and showing off our city it's benefitting an amazing project\nAnd we're gonna show of great vehicles in the process great Laura thank you for coming in my pleasure and thank you

Holstein migrants hoping to calm in Mexico from Guatemala Mexican police in riot gear responding with throngs of people hoped that we reach the\nDifferent outcomes and the different you know strategies that we can put in place to make sure that we are still taking some risk and really sort of trying to go after those big returns of some of the money but uh some of the money we can also still season retracted returns and really not that risk\nAnd he really wanted to make sure that he leaves an attractive legacy for his for his three children\nAnd we're going to talk about that a little bit later in the show that yeah the legacy than it was a super important to him\nAnd he's not ... unlike most of our clients he's getting a little older he's a widow or he he's done very well in the market\nBut he's gotten to a point where he's not sure and doesn't have the confidence in himself so he's looking to us to kind of look over his shoulder to help manage what he's got reduce the risk but but hopefully increase the returns\nAnd there might be you you might be somebody who watched your money go backwards so the last two weeks and you know like it because you're getting that much closer to retirement you're saying I'd like to\nI'd like to be a little more conservative I don't have to worry about this stuff anymore well what what John I'm In Virginia and talking about here might be for you so give us a call we make available what we call the retirement road map and what that does at first is it just really gives you a really good look\nAt where you are right now where is your money how much risk is involved with your money let's see if we can take some of that risk off the table let's not give up all our returns but let's take some of that risk away\nAnd some of that uh that uncomfortable about oh my gosh I heard the market went down and let me run to my account you don't want to be that person and retirement give us a call let's talk about it is to five one six six six five thousand to five one six six six five thousand well\nLet's take a look in this first segment of why this happened and it may be what we can do about it and Scott minor you probably don't know that name but you might know the name Guggenheim he is the chief global investing officer at the Guggenheim and they asked\nHim why you think this is happening and he's pointing his finger directly at the Federal Reserve\nHistory shows us that a bull markets and economic expansions don't die of old age they they get shot in the head by the central bank\nAnd ah you know German though and all are the key players of indicated that they are determined to keep raising rates and showing no signs of applause\nSo John he says that the reason the market is little flood or he is because they keep raising interest rates are supposed to be another one by the end of the year there might be three next year maybe even for next year and that's got the market kind of spoke to what do you say you agree\nWell and definitely agree if not the only item in the bucket that's ah that's you know making the the market volatile as it is but it is the key thing out there that we see every day when you see the market take a downturn and all the headlines are streaming across our computers saying\nUh you know the markets Jerry because the fans of raising rates or the federal chairman Atlanta said this rover that\nIt just makes the uncertainty going forward of how much capital is going to cost for the corporations who are all doing great we're getting unbelievable performances from the from the quarterly reports coming in from these from corporations around the world\nBut when as the cost of money goes up that puts a strain or air of uncertainty around what is going to cause these corporations to have their ... and have their money available to them how much is going to cost to borrow so when we see that people are getting kind of skittish end as interest rates go up\nIt gives people an alternative of where to put their money should I keep my money in a three per cent dividends stock is going up and down with the market or should I go out and buy ten year treasuries but are paying over three percent so there are options out there that we hadn't had before when the ten year treasuries were down and one and a half\nYeah one of the reasons that the one of the contributing factors to the bull market being so bullish for so long as that\nInterest rates have been you know depressed they've been you know intentionally cat down and so when you have that the interest rate things so low and basically your cash cash in the bank or you know cash that you want to be safe and guaranteed you can't\nPeople can't keep up with inflation is that people that aren't risk takers are having to go out and take risk because they're in theory losing money by having it just sitting in cash earning nothing 'cause it's you know not earning the gets inflation so when you have people start putting money in the market because they had no other choice you have more a\nCash going in the market more volumes going in and then as you have more guaranteed spot to put your money to earn um two three four percent if we see interest rates keep rising that's what we're going to see and short term CDs and savings accounts and money market accounts and things like that people are going to have a pool out\nAnd go put it somewhere where they know that they can earn that interest at that and sort of market fluctuation\nYou know it's one thing to say we're going to point a finger at the fed and and blame them for all of this it's another thing to say I miss Janet Yellen\nSo that\nWhat Jim Kramer said I couldn't believe it and I really\nMiss Janet Yellen I miss her because what she would do is say you know what I Need more input oh look at the market's down five hundred maybe we should make some calls yeah maybe that's what is that people will get that where does that go I don't why what's happening at the fed because the fed has decided like they were ...\nGot to put a stop this and I thought that was kinda fun [laughter] yeah Janet Yellen grounds teacher ... ah right well now we got to get into what are we going to do about it so that is\nSo you know we talk about taking risk off the table and the guy that we heard from first that's got miners who is from Guggenheim a asking me okay so where are you positioning your clients with your money what are you doing right now is very interesting what he said\nI Am a mature in to\nThe advice that was given by bearing on Rothschild when I asked the question of what was the secret of his great well set I sold early\nSo you know we're we've been taking risk off and we will slowly continue to er into the early part of next year and then be hopefully assertion correctly for the next downturn\nNow I like finances in economy but I don't know who the heck Baron ... Rothschild is used his picture is not up in my bedroom I Will assure you of that\nHey that I that\nThe tone here do he's taking risk off the table John you talk about that regularly and it really doesn't matter where you are in your investing life that is something that you probably should look at where they portion of your money isn't it\nIt is is calling pulling chips off the table let's we've got some we've had some great runner ups in different accounts four one K. R. I. brokerage accounts or whatever it may be\nWhy keep all of your money at risk in the market to chase the returns when we have all this uncertainty the client the Virginia was talking about earlier when we had in Seventy four years old we're moving a good portion of his IRA into and it fixed indexed annuity to protected and grow it\nWithout the market risk and keeping some money in the market he is going to take his requirement distributions from the money that we're leaving in the markets there but we'll be doing is each year drawing down on more and more of the risk and letting the\nGuaranteed insurance insurance products grow at a guaranteed rate so that we're we're we're not exposed to all this uncertainty you don't need those it doesn't matter if you're fifty five sixty five Seventy five reducing risk and preparing for a correction so that you can then\nBe position to get back in the market after it's already gone down\nVirginia would you say that people overall when they come in for a retirement roadmap really don't know how much money as they have at risk or how much they could be hurt if the market where to pull back considerably\nYeah absolutely people usually don't um well first of all people usually don't think about their overall portfolio as an overall\nPortfolio people think I'm a portfolio as one account and when we when we refer to a ... or the retirement roadmap we look at all of your pocket your rental properties your savings account checking account\nA brokerage account ... look at all of those things and put it together and when we look at all the things on one page and we break out what's at risk and what's not\nPeople don't usually do that people look at one ... one time in the mind one thing at one time corner they're looking at different things all different times aren't looking at ... am times that I haven't oh yeah oh yeah but you're usually not looking at\nSomething as a as a whole and that's what\nThat's one of the biggest thing that I think people are they can relate to and they really have a sense of comfort and innocence of overall\nKnowing of what's going on after they looked at the road map\nBecause they're able to say oh okay so this is how they all coordinate and this is how this out all that because when we do but they ran out together we're breaking down how much is at risk how much is that what it's going to look like if we you know she had a hundred percent of your money at risk and theoretically it's all and it has to be five hundred index fund\nAnd at least a hundred goes down fifty percent\nA hundred percent of your ... probably I was going down to the present and I mean that's just here for probably hasn't been cut in half that's just out at\nNow obviously that usually is not the case but if you have\nOnly forty percent of your money at risk and the market and all your money in the market as an absentee five hundred a mutual fund only forty percent of your\nPortfolio is down by half you know so we don't have all of that money rats and there's a big difference there aren't enough and then it's really easy for people to see them and put that\nThat together and that is what we offered to you each week of giving you that look at where you stand right now we call it the retirement roadmap let's get a look at where you are where your money is placed you've been working on this your whole life you are you at risk for having your money really go backwards if the market does take a real turn\nOn the national guard on suspicion of journalists from all the ... the Saudis say you got involved in a fight at the Saudi consulate\nCrown princess said he knew nothing of show the parents and the powerful air to the Saudi throne and Democrats and Republicans\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there's no place for things like that [noise] um [noise]\nRide or see on screen [noise]\nUm [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nThat's John McNeil mobile bay financial solution remotely on nothing is more for\nMy

retirement when you want to know that information right now that's one thing that we can do for you give us a call to five one six six six five thousand on line and be financial solutions dot com\nOh I thought this'll be the perfect story to bring into your family's because you have generations here that have kept a business going for almost one hundred years\nWell how do you keep the money going for almost a hundred years or more this is a survey that came out that says\nThat if mom and dad have money and they want to pass it on down to junior\n... by the time junior is gone that money has gone to this is about Seventy percent chance that that money doesn't make it to juniors death there's about Ninety percent chance that it does it make it through the grandchildren so\nThe problem here is watch I I I imagine you guys have seen this over and over John ... have you seen this over your life\nAnd we see it all the time ... it's a you know in the opening of the show it talks about Virginia has clients that are the children of my class in actuality Virginia has claws there are the great grandchildren of her great grandfather wow because we've she is the fourth generation\nAnd we make it a point to try and we're pretty successful probably Ninety percent of our clients at some point get the children or one of the children involved in the plant there when something does happen the children are already aware of what's going to what the succession planning is whether it's a business or individual well\nAnd that's very important because more times than not every family has that\nChild who is not very responsible with the money we had somebody you know if every week we had somebody this week that said you have three kids two of them were going to blow through the money what I was going to be responsible with it\nAnd we went through the steps of what happens when something happens to him we sit down with those beneficiaries because we have made sure\nThat not only all the beneficiary designations correct on all of his accounts whether it be a brokerage account or an insurance a camera nudity or whatever it may be but also his will his living will end this battle attorneys are all up to date and everything says what it's supposed to say\nVery common that one one document was say one thing and other documents says something different so that's why we want to make sure that\nIf they have a problem child then we're going to talk to them about\nSetting up a trust or having certain payout coming up until they're\nYou know maybe up in their forties that the children or grandchildren we want to impress upon individuals that they're a re can be their grandchildren's our right if managed correctly and that's why we pride ourselves on sitting down with those beneficiaries and don't let them make the greedy mistake of\nCashing in Dan's RA moms are re paying all those taxes and blowing it on a boat or a vacation or something like that\nLess let that our I provided the income\nThat year and I can I outlive just like your parents did\nBut it's a very common thing though I Would imagine you know of a hundred thousand dollars comes your way and it's a taxable thing you don't care that it's a hundred thousand dollars oh you care hey I just found sixty five thousand dollars\nAnd ... and you don't you're not bought in Virginia you're the perfect person to ask this because\nYour grandfather started the business your father's in the business you're in the business but what if you weren't would if you didn't have this connection to the family and the finances and you wanted to go out and do your own thing and you didn't have that connection I imagined that is a dynamic that takes place in some families\nFor sure and when you ... when we look at the succession planning and ... and the legacy planning and and things like that\nIt's important to know um you know you can only have so much control from the grave yeah people when they die they suddenly has some people that you know don't care what happens if they have it but more often than not people who work very hard for this money and they want to make sure some of them don't want their kids that anything because they want them to work as hard as they had to work for the money\nBut we have some people that say you know I've earned it and if I don't spend that yeah I Want to I Want to go on and when we look at that and we look at how much control you want to have and and all that kind of stuff\nA lot of a lot of things that come into play too are things that only\nAfter that ... before they die um and all the different benefits that we've built in to the retirement road map with the\n... in the long term care benefits and things like that having something I'm said that the kids some now some parents don't want the kids now if they ask because they don't want them to\nAh to count on it or what ever count on it yeah that's another thing they want them to make sure that they're independently\nOkay because you know you don't ever know how much you're going to need you know we tell our clients is all the time you know this is a plan laid out but there's lots of different things that can happen and one of the biggest question marks as how much money people are going to need much income they're going to need and for how long you know nowadays people are living for so long and people kind of laugh when we take them out to age\nIn Ninety five or a hundred and they say oh you know I\nKnow lay and we say okay well you know look at your mom who died in Ninety seven and look at your you know that this kind of thing and then look at\nYou know today's modern medicine and all that kind of stuff so when we look at that it's really important for at least somebody doesn't know when mom and dad\nOr start needing that help whether it be because ah the memories going or you know their health is hunting or whatever it may be that they know what options they have so that the kids aren't getting themselves into financial trouble because they're having to pay for exercise and they don't really know mom and dad half\nOr who to call to see what they have\nA lot of times people say well I'm not going to tell my kids have but I'm going to give them your card and if anything happens they can call you [laughter]\nSo you know that's ... that's ... that's something we talked about that's really important to us because that's\nPart of the legacy benefit and making sure that they know\nWhat's going on and how it's going to work even if they don't know exactly what all you have at least know that they do have some options and benefits um if something were to happen and and different scenarios and things like that because that's a big part of the legacy plan because as you know Randy are familiar with it and your family as well having that\nThe cost of long term care really to get away at somebody saying that some allowed him one of the biggest holes\nAnd somebody's planner somebody portfolio is that they often self insure I have a couple of million dollars that's fine well what if we ought to be hitting the market what if we're you know what if you have all these things and what if we live for a long time and and just all these different things and there's a lot of different\nHands in the cookie jar that can take money out of it um that you don't you're not expecting to\nThere's a lot of different ways to handle this you know so many people will go to their kid with a manila envelope and say okay this is the death envelope I'm putting it in my\nDad died at all and here I said I did that did that yesterday on Monday we'll if this ...\nMy secretary to address that gay they they have\nAnd then you open it up and here's John and Virginia's a business card yeah yeah\nDo you bring up so many good points number one you may have three children and two are going to be great with the money and one isn't and what do you do about that you want to be fair", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "city": "Mobile", "day": "20"}
