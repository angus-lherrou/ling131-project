{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "You're listening to Gulf Coast mornings with Kelly Bennett and uncle Henry on news talk with them for nine WVU being Biloxi [noise]\nAnd on news radio seven ten WN TMI Ninety nine five FM the jak immobile [noise]\nNews headlines coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national corresponded bills for Bill good morning\nGood morning uncle Henry gone and Kelly morning\nSo bills or for outlining forest what's going to happen with our military and the southern border\nYeah this is active US military is being deployed as we speak to the border between the United states and Mexico there even giving it a name at the Pentagon it's called operation faithful patriot\nWhere these fifty two hundred troops will join the two thousand National Guard troops that have already been at the border\nAnd they will be assigned in a support role they will not be actively engaged with immigrants coming to the U.S border\nBecause they can't do that by law of the law says that the U.S military can cannot directly and force us domestic law including immigration law without congressional approval a show they will be there and a support role\nThey will be there with a military police there will be pilots who will be a will be flying helicopters and fixed wing aircraft with night vision equipment along the border area to help the border patrol or there will be engineers working on roads and also to fortify\nSections of the fence that may need it along the border\nUp but uh do some of those service members have already started arriving at staging areas in South Texas Arizona and California\nAnd then it will be decided exactly where they will be deployed along the border but it's not uncle Henry and Kelly like we're we're putting these troops all along the border area there with rifles trained at immigrants heading north of that will not be the case\nWell I'm kinda curious because when we talked to yesterday the caravan was growing so where do we stand in regard to the numbers and the caravan\nWell now it's it's getting smaller and as as you might expect to because they're still about eight hundred miles away from the U.S border\nAnd they'd had been well the estimates are all over the place she heard upwards of ten thousand at one point now are they say it's about thirty five hundred may have broken up into different groups uh but\nUh people are either a deciding that this is just not going to happen I mean going with young children and our or babies in some cases all the way to the U.S border uh and they may be accepting offers of asylum and unemployment assistance that Mexico has offered\nA so there are some people that are are taking that route and then it appears that the Mexican authorities are beginning to step things up a little bit yesterday there were six hundred\nA group of six hundred who got on that bridge between Guatemala and Mexico try to get into Mexico and they were blocked by Mexican federal police and told a turnaround a so a combination of things would lead you to believe that if\nThis caravan or the caravans continue to move toward the U.S border the numbers will up drastically dwindled by the time they get here\nBuilds up for so many things in the country seem to be coming to a boil right before we vote yes so when are when do we expect this caravan to actually get close to the border will they get there before we vote\nNo uh no they they can't no way they can go these eight hundred miles in one week\nOr so they will not get there but there's a reason you're hearing about all these things right now because uh the the president wants to get his immigration policy out there\nBefore the midterm elections are for something that can be voted on ... and gain supportive Republican voters and those who agree with his immigration policies\nSo they're getting all of these policies out there now\nOr so they can be a factor in the mid term elections even though this deployment of the five thousand plus troops is scheduled to last until December fifteenth that could always be extended so they're going to be there till at least mid December and it may take some of these immigrants that long to get there\nSo when they get their what happens well the\nPresident has now said ah if they get there if and when they get there we are going to set up tent cities\nAre that when they get to the border and request asylum or we will say okay I hear you have to stay in this tent and a and a weight you're processing\nAlso he let it be known that the asylum process is going to be very stringent in fact uh the new numbers and show that for fiscal year twenty Eighteen those granted asylum amounted to only thirty three percent of the total people ah that showed up at the border\nSo that is expected to go down even more he's telling people it may take months as well so if you come up here you're going to be put in a tent city and held they're not released until you can be evaluated for asylum and not many people are going to get it if you don't get asylum you're headed back home\nRight well uh I guess a lot of time for one more question are we are we going to be hearing as much about this after the after the midterms or is this going to go off the front pages\nI think it all depends on how this a caravan holds together\nI mean if it begins to dwindle I think it'll disappear from the news cycle or if it holds together and they continue to get closer to the to the U.S border then we will hear about it again but you know how things have been going uncle Henry a there is undoubtedly something gonna come up between now and then that will probably dominate things\nRight bill ... thank you for your time today You're welcome anytime\n... news radio national correspondent\nNews headlines coming up [laughter] you can always\nSee what happens during the

medicine doctors that are incredible at ... sounds like there's a little bit of an overlap here\nThere certainly is and you see that throughout orthopedic surgery um were different sub specialty is within a the a a main specially ever with big surgery overlap\nAnd certainly um elbow pads allergy is one where there is considerable overlap um I got um extensive training or where I did my fellowship\nA primarily because the athletes at the University of Virginia where I trained 'em ... it was just structured as such that any uh athlete with a sports related injury or associated with the risk or the elbow or the hand came and saw us within the hand division rather than the sports medicine division there\nUm but certainly there's overlap and we're I'm both sub specialty is very well qualified to take care of these injuries\nI usually ask the questions that gets scorn [laughter]\nSo I Apologize in advance of we've we've interviewed tremendously talented orthopedic surgeons on this program from Alabama orthopedic clinic we've talked a lot about a hip replacement sneak replacements is there such a thing as an elbow replacement there is\nAnd it's a procedure that I'm well qualified and well trained to do the indications are very small okay um there's not a whole lot of people out there that require an elbow replacement Moore meet the specific criteria for that\nHip and new replacement is much much much more common than okay hobo replacement but there is a subset of people who benefit from it greatly and it's certainly a procedure that I uh feel very comfortable performing\nI just I was curious about the uh house similar or those joints to each other I guess not as similar as I thought\nThat that is correct um and the you know the technology and uh the knowledge base in the years of experience doing hip and knee replacements\nUm as far greater than uh you know what we know about doing elbow replacement surgery um it's a much newer procedure I'm relatively speaking um and like I said much fewer people are end up requiring them than it hit her knee replacement\nOkay we do need to take a break when we come back we have a lot more to ask

I'm uncle Henry here with Mary from ... nine nine we continue our conversation with our guest\nFrom Alabama orthopedic clinic\nDr Jeff boat ride is brand spanking new to Alabama orthopedic clinic and he is a part of the hand and upper extremity surgery team\nAnd I want to talk about some of the common conditions and injuries that you deal with carpal tunnel syndrome can can you explain to me what that is I hear people talk about it all the time and I don't really know what it is or what you do for it\nAbsolutely well like a lot of things in the hand or multiple treatment options for it but we'll start with what it is a carpal tunnel syndrome is a very common problem it is one of the most common conditions that a patient comes and sees a hand surgeon for\nUm it involves a pressure on the media nerve which is one of the nerves that goes to the hand um and ah causes symptoms such as numbness in tingling particularly in the\n... the uh index finger and the rings and the um lung finger and portion of the ring finger from time to time\nI'm a if a left untreated it can continue to get worse it can cause problems waking patients up at night and I'm In very late stages can actually start to impact some of the a\nFunction of the muscles that that nerve goes to in hand what do you do for it [noise] um well the uh the pressure in carpal tunnel on the nerve occurs at the level of the rest that nerve runs through a tunnel called the carpal tunnel\nInterest which is made up by the small bones in the uh in the in the ... in the hand and the risk that makes the floor in the size of the tunnel the top of the tunnel or the roof of the tunnel is made up by a ligament\nThat ligament does not really serve much of a purpose um and in addition to that nerve benign tendons that bend your fingers and thumb down also run through the tunnel\nSo you have ten things nine tendons and one nerve which runs through a very small place\nSo any sort of inflammation within that tunnel and we're talking a matter of a millimeter to being the difference between that nerve being happy and having room to breathe versus not happy and when it's not happy that we're carpal tunnel syndrome is\nSo this is this something that we caused by our own behavior with our our wrist and hand or do some people just develop at a ... from from heredity\nThat's a very good question and that's a question my patients often ask me\nAnd they have done large studies looking at that um it does typing on a computer all day or using your hands and manual labor all day predispose you to have carpal tunnel they've been unable to identify any association with any activity in carpal tunnel\nI'm now it is true that many workers and may people who use the computer all day get carpal tunnel syndrome but there are also people who don't really use their hands much at all who also get it and it really comes back to the fact that it's an an atomic set up to have a problem when you have nine\nNerves I'm I'm Sorry nine tendons in one nerve running through their um it doesn't take much for that nerve to become unhappy\nOkay so where do we start treatment lies with\nSo a treatment wise it varies it depends a little bit on the severity of the carpal tunnel syndrome um and can be anything from for people who have primarily nighttime symptoms a which is you know numbness in tingling in those fingers that wakes them up at night\nUm and also can be a painful as well or that can sometimes be treated conservatively by wearing splints at night we all tend to kind of sleep with our wrists in a flex position and that does increase the pressure on the carpal tunnel I'm into wearing a splint at night can be helpful um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ask The Experts (WMT)", "city": "Mobile", "day": "30"}
