V. receiver that's the first cost and that's about three or four hundred dollars and then for anywhere from a thousand to Fifteen hundred dollars you can get\nA five point one surround systems that sounds so much better so much better speaking of you know we're going to do we're going to change microphones 'cause I I thought I'd steal Heather's microphone I'm getting paid for\nA paid back for it

mark\nLeo good to talk to my friend [noise] I'm a I'm thinking I made a mistake about three months ago when I went back to a Comcast or TV\nYou know what happened this or you you were what were you doing before Comcast\n\nOr a ... string we cut the\nCord though you said I don't want cable I'm going to save money I'm going to get everything over the Internet or over the top of that save your money just out of curiosity\nLet's say the accord with them on the other day about a hundred billion dollars ... last night and put on the house and that was good\nThat's the best deal on television is over the air if you could do it\n[noise] yeah well that's why I went back contest they started having problems with the ... yeah so anyway Comcast you get a little\nItchy and also they are given some really good deals out so yeah content or TV\nI remember I here's the deal income catch if you could recover cast also if you go into the office because they have offices are often they're like storefronts and up and talk to the human or ... or you can often get a great deal they have wonderful offers but the trick is the only uh you know work for the first year\nAnd then all of a sudden you build doubles so the\nTrick and I asked I asked the woman she said yeah we we always have something just keep coming back before the for the years out ask for the new deal\nYeah so that's just something to keep in mind\nI've got a really good deal for ten years actually you're the one you're caches HBO Showtime them so much for yourself\nThe number of ... yeah you got to be it's all just got to pay attention to it so what what's the ... but now are you glad are you sorry what you said you had some issues\nWell one issue is the remote we got the fish and then I got I Love that ... that you can talk to about ... that's\n... that is a nice feature yeah Comcast is working hard with the ex one system so we're to compete with you know really what is a threat to their business model which is people like you court cutters so they they they want to make sure they're offered something for that extra hundred and twenty bucks\n[noise] pretty good anyway the other day you know they use them for the Internet forever the other day woke up\nAnd no Internet connection do you go to a browser and wanted to activate right listen to the table right if you will not\nBut that's how you learn right you you know I really David all of this stuff makes sense to me because I've done it a million times I Know exactly where what you're going through\nAnd um it's kind of you know and just a pain you\nGotta keep going through it do you have do you ride Harley says well no no I Know\nBut it's like that has meant like your breath on my own personal highly uh yeah well I uh I don't know what else to do you know bad capacitors would have\nThe same thing and that was a problem for a while but I think those have been pretty much a solved as well\nUm [noise] boy I you know you ...\nUsually if the mother board has issues you know there's a perhaps the ram as not being seen you'll get posts coach who get beeps and booths but it sounds like you're not getting the power on self test you kind of it's freezing right at that point\nRight [noise] yeah and I don't know off the off the top of my head I don't have a good solution for you on that one anybody in the chat room or\nListening wants to call in and make some suggestions is not it's not posting I think because uh it's it's stopping at the post otherwise you'd get something you get you get sounds at least so\nIt didn't need a little uh other trouble like a like log files or ... laws\nNot getting a log files so there's nothing to look at [laughter]\nUh you you know I'd refreshed the bios or you know make sure maybe maybe it could be the bios got corrupted fact that's that's that's a seems like a likelihood at this point in and that's remember that's stored in the sea ma she changed the batter but at the same lost his only apart that only clear as part of it that if the frame where itself is\nDamaged that's actually a problem that's the equivalent of you know that's scary thing when you're updating the from wearing a mother born and they say don't unplug it if you do so and so it may be that that's that that's what's happened because it sounds like that's not getting run that it's it's ...\nThe only thing I haven't done is maybe it is re installed the ... if you\nCan yeah I Would certainly try that\n[noise] All right well and\nGood luck might yeah used to be I mean this is a fun\nThing to do as a hobby to build a build your own computer and it's not hard in fact I think every uh every parent should make their child\nTo this one [laughter]\nIt's not like rebuilding an engineer or something I mean you're not going to get your hands dirty a but it's a great way for a kid especially you know if your if your twelve year old says Thirteen year old says I Want a computer\nA great let's let's get your computer at first and I've I've seen parents is I Love this idea first let's choose all the parts you got to go out and do the research\nAnd to pick the parts that you want to use the budget here's how much you can spend you've got to figure it out\nThat means they have to go online they have to read reviews they have to look at the figure out what parts are needed to make a computer great place to start is a PC Perspective P. C. P. E. R. dot com because they do something a kind of old fashioned they have a hardware leader board they call it based on their reviews\nIf you it's at right at the top on the page PC per dot com\nIt's a hardware leader board it's ... they have a four different systems you can build starting with a foreigner fifty three dollar low end system and all the way up to two thousand eight hundred and fifty dollar dream system and they list there don't don't tell your kid yet but they list there all the parts you're going to need you need a case you know the mother board you need a processor\nNeed a video card you need memory you need storage your hard drive\nYou may or may not want to get a sound card depending on\nYour mother board will have a sound card in the network or most of the time you need to get a power supply case usually has power supply built in so they it on their on these on the leader board they say well foreign fifty three dollars here's what you should get for two thousand eight hundred fifty dollars here's what you should get\nAnd uh it's a great way to get the kids don't tell me about this yet maybe if he has trouble finding it but say what why do we need to make a PC and these can learn a lot and then okay let's choose the parts because you know how much do you have to spend how much do you want to spend on the process or on the memory and much memory do you want\nAll of that is a great learning experience however [laughter]\nIt is also\nFront with peril because uh you put it all together and it doesn't start a boy and then then you're in John's Josh is a situation where [noise] what do I do now and it's all on you again great for learning but not so great for productivity might be might be one of those things that you are\nYou know you do once and then from then on you go to do that but that would be my advice or our show that they brought you buy carbon I now this is important I mean maybe this is another part of the puzzle\nAnd nowadays knowing how to put together hardware maybe not as important for a young person coming up knowing how to put together the software had a security system had to make a system safe though that's all important and certainly\nIf you are are in business the most important thing is known how to keep your data safe because that's it right that's your business your data is your business carbon that is the data protection platform for businesses with\nPowerful server backup and replication solutions perfect choice for business looking for a single vendors solution\nTo cover all their data protection needs you get your flexible scalable server backup everything is secured by the way with end and block level encryption indeed duplication which is very nice saves you space in network bandwidth\nReal time replication of super cool that means is always being\nBacked up and went cloud fail over it means is ... ... let's say you get bit by malware take good news flip a switch your back up and

talking about PET scan\nHow you get scans and I looked in the u._k. but I never got it so today I'm Ellen Ellen how to you about it 'cause I signed up for their weight like on a paid survey\nYeah [noise] and I was wondering\nIf they can't they can waste your time but they're not a scam you if you don't give them a credit card if you don't give them too much information\nSo there are certainly people serving all the time that you know a big part of market research and men you know that's all legitimate achieve with scams is at some point they're going to ask you for something you don't want to give him a credit card number access to your computer software that you have to install don't do any of that we'll report the ticket\nWere mobiles days connected news radio seven ten double knew

[noise]\nThe caravan coming closer I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News thousands of migrants resuming their march toward the U.S Mexico border\nThey busted through Honduras they went through about a mile and now they're trying to tackle Mexico right now they are north of that river\nNorth of the bridge that you saw people on yesterday so last night people got frustrated found a bridge Mexico's process about six hundred and forty people tend to get a visa for potentially asylum here could take forty five Ninety Days people got process they weren't working so last night\nAnd and those advertisers want to buy or people who listen to a show like this so that's not far from illegal that's that's the way a lot of free media works and I'm all for it\nThat's my whole life that's what I've done and I think it's great and I don't think it's a scam\nI think it's fine uh so that's Facebook and Google but then there are things like the survey sites and the the trick and I think I emphasize with dawn is they're they're gonna get something in return they're either going to get your attention your time\nThat's what advertisers want your attention right or maybe they're going to get your email address your home address something that they can use and sell your email address is valuable because they can sell it to other people to send you spam\nYou know offers for a thin line between offers and spam [noise] ah so that's valuable so what I suggested to dawn and I would reiterate is make a email address is not your main address that you used just for stuff like this spam at Yahoo dot com or something like that\nOr stuff I don't want a Gmail dot com that's those are probably taken but you get the idea and then you you need access to that account because a lot of times or the very first thing they'll lose verify that address me off to go click checked my email click a link so that's that's fine\nJust understand that you're trading your time you're probably going to be looking at some ads that kind of thing and maybe you're going to get some money out of it\nA couple of people are chat room people I\nKnow and respect like scooter X and ... say they like ... dot com P. E. R. K. dot com and you know ... it's pretty clear what's going on as soon as you go to a site like this\nYou're doing something you're seeing ads most of the time and if you do enough of that they make money because they can charge the advertiser and they send you some small amount it's kind of like if you have a cash back credit card right and you get one or two percent back\nWell of course you're getting one or two percent back as a credit card companies charging the merchant five percent they're giving you a little bit on the side they're making money too and it's a win win you know and that's great\nDoesn't cost you anything except maybe some time some attention so it's important though to understand and if somebody wants something more than that if they ever ask you this is the classic con game and this is this this is the unfortunate thing is ... con games that worked in real life\nAre now in a in the Internet world and they're ... what's funny is does the same games\nThey're the same games they're just change the Nigerian prince scam things like that they've been going on for years in real world and now the Internet's just given them a\nWhole bunch of new ways to play the game there's a wonderful book at a highly recommend are called the confidence game\nWhy we fall for it every time [laughter] by a a wonderful woman named Maria ... Copa I've actually interviewed her on this game it's a great book and it's about modern cons and their relationship to\nThe old cons raise a fascinating person she's actually become a poker champion she's reading a new book about up\nHigh stakes poker in order to do that [laughter] she's a become a poker chance she's brilliant\nBrilliant but her book the confidence game is a great read if you want to kind of understand I'm sure that's been excerpted magazines you could probably find it on what parts of it on line to understand these old games and how they're you know the pigeon drop games do you ever see the sting or ... I Love I Love con men\nA lot of great movies and books about con man they're just all of those games have made it to the Internet and new\nKind of clothing but the same exact idea and in general\nIf I were to generalize all of these games play on one thing you're read\nSomething for nothing so that's the that's\nAlarm bells something for nothing as the alarm bell in general things like the pigeon drop\nRequire in the long run you to give them money in order to get more money back that's how the Nigerian prince scam works for instance you ever get that email sure you have a low I'm a Nigerian prince I have twenty million dollars I Need to get it out of the country fast and I need to help somebody in America\nI'm going to get in return for which I'll give you ten percent but if you answer those emails eventually they're going to say you need to put some money in my account just to pay for transit fees or whatever\nThey're going to get money out of you so all of these kinds of games in the long run will take your money\nBut the way they do it is by promising you something for nothing so just don't fall for that you know that you're you're smart and the just be aware of the Internet is bringing these wonderful fun things into your home as we enter late stage predatory capitalism\nBut there's some some of this is fine you know if if you use Facebook and you love face but you get a lot of Facebook you know that the information you're giving them they're using to sell ads\nThat's fine that's a fair trade as long as you're doing it with eyes wide open same thing with Google we get so much value out of things like Facebook Google Twitter Instagram\nThey're all free but but there's something there there's a way they're making money 'cause they're not free for the guys who run those companies is expensive so what are they make and how they're doing it generally it's advertising speaking of which is wonderful show absolutely free but [laughter]\nThat's only because we have

A. U. N. I. S. um doesn't have a proper titles and stay\nKrista in there that I Do not like I went through it all the pictures up one of the flick or the other day I made sure they all had titles just because he is\nGood yes yes I'm so it's yeah what are we looking at looking at a little tugboat all sorts um but it's not just a boat it has a face an ad on I have no idea why you\nSee it or you just obviously you've never seen it's probably a cultural a pop cultural relevance to something in the United yeah but I Am not aware of how it all hang engine it's a kids' show how it's from Thomas the tank I think so yeah\nIt ... it does it does is it it's probably that means it doesn't it doesn't click with me as much as with anyone who you're always you're not from around here but it's still clicked with me because it's a huge and one look at face it's cute as a hat on so um I think it's a fun boat\nI like it the door to see there is a bit it anytime there's taxes that picture I just make that the name of the picture so they that's\nWhat I Do I'm you know that's that's that's the simplest thing you can do for a making\nTightens up your photos yeah think simple if Texas in a photo as you said make that title [noise] um if something simple is on the photo something very clear is on the photo that's the subject but the photo then make that the title like twisted in the next picture oh in Boulder and has\nA photo of a pink hats and he called a photo pain cat it's that simple out so it's a\nGood one too I this is this is a bold think this is a very pink cat I likely to end it there\nThere are several reasons why first of all this totally clear what this is about it's a pink had um the cat is in focus its biggest in the center so it's a relatively simple photo there is stuff going on in the background seems like a reception of some sort of their people they are talking to each other but it's it's clear that the hat\nIs the thing that's that is is about because it's focused and the rest of our focus um there's also a nice little color contrasting going on with the woman wearing a hat where's the green dress or at least some green dress a green red is a nice primary color contrast and you can see that had\nBeen kind of looks like it's like the windy so that gives its a motion with in the things that are on top I don't even know what you call those but stuff that's on hats you know [laughter]\nUm yeah I like it ... it jumped at me because it's a crystal clear the colors of so bright and it was just a little cheerful photo of a hat\nI like it to books like ... or something some event\nLooks looks like high class you know it's a classy picture a class I'm like you and me who are wearing our says [laughter] I I think it is a really classy high like ...\nI Love them and they're perfect for TV 'cause they have no brim so they don't block the light they don't put a shadow and you're right I guess very good I guess you have to pass all in front of a always make me think of the Maltese falcon uh-huh yeah yep [noise]\nLess than ten dollars a month or so all told much less expensive so if you can't get this working there are some very good consumer\nOptions out there that I Would recommend\nOutdoor cameras a nest it makes outdoor cameras I have to test out their cameras that work quite well from a nest dot com and then I'm a ring also makes outdoor cameras that have lights on them that can come on and so you could see everything that's going on all of them work at night\nSo you're saying her camera she's it she's seeing what what is what is what is going wrong it's not recording it's not she's not seeing video what's going wrong\nSo for some reason it um I think the video was coming up it was a long time ago some time last year that there was some kind of an air methods popping up\nAnd she's going to get it pointed her mobile\nHonestly I Would just throw it all out or try to sell it on ... and get a nest Kim I'm\nSo much cheaper I ... at any effort you spend any ... what is this guy going to\nCost you know to fix it it seems like a lot of work um and and frankly not as convenient solution the DVR solution is the old way of doing this just recording locally\nUm so I Would I honestly that's what I Would do there's a nest Kevin out during this campaign two hundred dollars\nHigh definition or does need why fi access because it's it's connected to the Internet via why fight in the nest has a website you can go and see what's going on at any time or you can see previous you can get alerts on your smartphone\nInstead of having a TV set up with the DVR she's using her phone I'm I'm a it's hard for me to diagnose what's going on with the cameras at this point because I don't really understand the question\nWell the thing is that she had a mobile app for it and um she I don't know all the details to it but I'm basically the question if if I get the DVR replace\nAdult replaces the DVR and please\n[laughter] that's gonna cost you so much money for a sub optimal solution I I think she's got a uh she should write the whole thing off\nA the camera records to DVR via some cable but she's got attached to the camera that comes into the business is that it\nYeah and it's all connected on it I mean her network I mean her home network and everything so she was able to heal it remotely [noise]\nAnd that's why I just want to know is there some kind of like a like an app or we can have our own home set up and be able to see what they're like a certain apps without having to go through other services [noise]\n\nWell if you're going to do it on a nap over the Internet it's got to be stored somewhere um is there if is it a privacy concern or is it a costs concern\nAll the above okay um\nI think you could trust nest they're not looking at the video I'm the first costs a I think it's it's considerably more Ford we've already spent more money on this thing than you will spend over you know five years on and they asked a the picture is going to be better I just don't know the brand\nThat she has a I'm not sure he again what you know name yeah sure what you're trying to do you say you ... the guy says well if you could tell me the ... message I can fix it and she can't see the message because she's not seen the video is that the problem\nYeah Ali hook up to it because it hasn't H. T. M. I. L. L. E. hook up aged because that's how she used to have it connected to her old TV she gave her old TV to me so because\nYou are without work anymore with getting I Am at the edge but now she wants to see what the era what age yeah my only connect it to her computer monitor it on there you know just like I'm thinking that might be something wrong with ... or\nSo and it might have just throw this thing out please [laughter] you're going to spend\nMore money trying to figure out what's wrong and you're going to get a sub optimal solution anyway and it's going to break again um there are so many companies that do this my recommendation would be to look at ... dot com ring dot com\nOr they don't have outdoor cameras at a wise cam which is\nThe least expensive but I've got these wise camps everywhere they're so inexpensive I actually have one pointing out a window it can it then it's indoor so that's okay but if she doesn't have a window I Would go to nest dot com get a ... they have outdoor nest cameras that worked fabulously\nOr you can see what's going on at all times you'll get alerts on your smartphone you don't have a DVR because they store the video is so much better uh all ... as long as she's got why it'll work just fine that you need somewhere to plug it in but obviously she's got that for the old\nSystem or if you go to the wire cutter dot com and you look at their recommendations for the best outdoor security cameras they also say nest camp outdoor hundred sixty five dollars for the camera hundred sixty five dollars from Amazon that's you know that's going to be less than than fixing that DVR\nAnd you can get multiple cameras if you want to ... uh two hundred eighty dollars on Amazon and then she pays the nest service I Can't remember what\nIt is it's not not horribly expensive and it's great because well I'll give you an example we were um we were in Japan or last spring and I was just looking at the camera see what's going on in the front yard and I saw my mailbox I have one of those rural mailboxes had been knocked over I thought oh man so I go back\nAnd I was able to find exactly what happened at a car plowed into it did a little more research I have a doorbell camera from ring I was able to see the person coming getting out of the car wringing our doorbell Oh nice she wanted to get it fixed I figured out who it was it was a\nWoman delivering newspapers next door and she was rolling up newspapers and she wasn't paying attention she planning her mailbox\nTalk to her I said don't worry about it we wanted a new mailbox anyway but I have a complete record that I Can't tell you how useful it is I have several outdoor cameras a we have outdoor cameras here as well at the studio\nAnd so and it's not expensive and it's so much better so all of these old systems where you had the big old thing that looks like a camcorder and wiring and it's going into a DVR which is recording and looping over and over again all of this is completely\nObsolete uh I think it's just nutty just to just to\nPut any more money into it because I can guarantee you it's going to cost you more than a getting a a given that security camera hundred sixty five dollars a done you have to have wife by and you have to have power or you plug it in um it's it was pretty easy to install you know takes takes submitted to install comes with all the screws and stuff\nThe other one if you want lights the ring dot com they sell 'em\nThere and as I said they're spots of republic cast they sell a flood light camera that has a camera and for like always work at night or the ring you have a microphone and the speaker and an alarm that you can bring you could talk to people\nIf there's somebody outsiders store they because they get out of here

see each other you could then if you want to have for why fi access points each one attached to those and those would have different names and passwords for each tenant\nAnd uh they would then be securely a surfing so that's one way to do it a little more expensive one thing you might want to look at doing is if you're going to do that is use the ... to route ethernet cable to each tenants apartment and then connect the wife fight in their apartment which you give them better access\nUm so so you said with the editor accepted one device and\nRoute or all the white yeah then you need for why fi access points right ah and you put them in bridge mode and they each have their own discreet Internet basically so it's creating for virtual networks [noise]\nOkay so that's probably the\nThat's the most secure fastest way to do it um and then it's more expensive because you got to buy for access points but if you're just buying why fi access points you're not using them as routers you can get less expensive ones probably under a hundred dollars that are just why fight [noise]\nOkay um and so another thought I had was just just putting it in and letting the attendance decide if they're worried about the security\nThat's the other option routers yeah just yeah that's the other option they can absolutely secure at themselves in other ways yeah\nUm so I guess\nHere's here's one thing you might you you you kind of do want to be aware of but one of the things he has read her ex will do it for you is give you an idea of who is using how much bandwidth what are the issues that can come up is that one of them is using so much bandwidth nobody else can get on line\nRight\nSo that would have that a dish and you have a lot of metrics from the edge router that will give you an idea of how much bandwidth each each tenant as you say\nOkay um I also have one comment on the previous caller ... ... yeah um I've done a lot of camera installs and I ... I don't know she didn't mention how many cameras they had on them but if you're talking like one of the DVR we're doing like eight to you know twelve cameras there\nYou know as some of these like\nIn a liquor store you'd have like maybe twenty Garrett or something\nYeah that's a different story you're right that's expensive to do that with these nest camps consumer cameras\nBut yeah uh 'cause you have to pay for the storage for each camera that would really add up\nYeah I Would think that so I was going to be cameras here would you recommend like the ... camera for\nThat are a lot of them I Love him yeah absolutely\nAnd that you know there's a subscription they give you a deal you should you should check to see how much it cost per camera and you don't have to store you know you can store months worth of data or five days worth of data you get to choose\nAnd so that might be another thing to you know check the pricing on that but I think these are really good and and they're very high quality cameras\nUm there are cameras if you go to the wire cutter dot com and there were a view there are cameras that have no subscription fee or they don't store nearly as much but maybe you don't care right because\nAh maybe if anything happens if you have three days that's plenty yeah so that's another thing to look at the ... circuit if you look at their security camera reviews talks about some that have\nNo like the ... that they don't unfortunately do an outdoor camera but the wise cams don't charge you for storage or you're responsible for your own storage in effect on camera storage\nI'm the one that has no subscription ... circle to will only do twenty four hours of storage free so you just have to you know you have to care only about the last twenty four hours\nDo any of them have an opt in for a door gunner on a device like a a USB stick or\nYeah or there's a memory the wise scams or an amazing\nDeal W wise III there twenty and thirty dollars thirty dollars just for the pan tilt zoom you can control via the Internet\nThey charge nothing for storage\n'em and they ... but you ... if you want storage you put in a little micro S. D. card into the camera and it will then Stuart locally okay those are great they they need power only are they are why five based and they're very\nCheap yeah that's a ... but they don't but so far they don't have an outdoor one although these these guys are\nKind of blew my mind I imagine they will have an outdoor one at some point\nI bought a number of these wise camps and I'm I Can't believe the thirty dollars I Can't believe it\nSounds like a steel yeah\nYeah they've been around for a while people are very happy with them I've had a great results and even if they let's say they break every year who cares [laughter] right uh and and they're pretty robust because my son every time he finds it throws it on the ground unplug the throat [laughter] he doesn't like having a camera that W Y.

and then all of a lot of that\nKind of a timely today\nAboard the two eighty eight eighty eight ask\nLeo the phone number back to the phones we go and line one Daniel in Long Beach\nHi Daniel Daniel yeah I mean I'm like oh you're Daniel let's make\nLet's get that clear okay oh you are you familiar with Web design\nA yes I Am\nA now to get what ... what are the minimum late all the different languages like what are\nThe you want to become a Web designer Daniel is that your goal [laughter] I'm thinking about it and yeah I something on the side so in the early\nDays of the Web or a Web page and actually it's still true today when you actually look at this what they called the source code of the Web page a Web page\nIs composed of a couple of different things HTML which stands for high protects markup languages the kind of the fundamental the route language of a website and it's it's markup language which means that it's very simple it says this text should be bold this text should be a Talib size this tech should be big\nThis is an image this image should linked to this when you click on this text you should go to this Web page that kind of thing that's HTML [noise]\nAh yes CSS was added later it stands for cascading style sheets and the idea was you could encapsulate information credit for it in a way it's like a macro language you could say whenever I use this HTML tag what I mean is this font this type size this kind of thing\nAnd see us that's been used it increasingly to style pages the whole idea nowadays have a website as you want to separate the contents of the website from the display from the layout of the website and the early days we pushed it all together you'd have\nYou know HTML tags followed by text followed by more tags and you could actually do that in a text editor we've gone way beyond that so modern websites almost always have a data back in which has the text the images the contents of the site\nAnd then information about how to display that which will include three different kinds of things HTML is still there\nA CSS the style sheets still there and then the third and nowadays most important part is job a script almost all Web pages today use of programming language called job a script to do the fancier things animations sliding menus hidden things\nAre a lot of that is done in job a script\nNow in order to so really if you say what language should I learn to do Web design it's those three HTML CSS those are the fundamental things you need to know those\nAnd then job a script is the ... is a true programming language\nThat all Web browsers understand the job of script typically stored on the server as his the HTML CSS and the data and by the way the data's usually stored in a data base right that's things like the text the links the images those are stored in the database so you need to understand databases a little bit\nAnd if you want to get into Web design a day you're probably going to be learning something called frameworks these our Web frameworks that help you design a interactive pages\nThe most one of the most popular widely used it came from Facebook it's called react that's a job a script framework so you'll be doing job a script but you'll be using libraries from react Twitter has its own a Google has its own\nAnd there are many languages you can use in fact you know for instance when I write Web pages I generally don't write directly in job a script because for years java scripts was a nightmare languages actually settled down quite a bit but for years it was just awful\nAnd so I Will use a tool that will then be interpreted as a job a script something like closure you could do that with goer python variety of other languages and then you don't have to write in job a script
