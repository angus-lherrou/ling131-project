Morgan's Wonderland in San Antonio his daughter has special needs\nAnd she was on vacation about Twenty years ago his is a wealthy man he ... he retired and he was on vacation with his daughter and who has special needs and she was playing in a pool with some kids and when ... when her daughter tried to play catch with the with the kids they just dropped the ball and got out\nAnd he said he just couldn't take that look on her face of a disappointment\nSo he decided that there was no place in the world that had a place for people with special needs and and who don't to come together so he created this water park thirty six million dollars\nIn San Antonio and it's all twelve percent of the population has special needs and America that's born out of three people yeah\nAnd so now when they're big they're big thing was that you know for kids who are electric we're in a wheelchair that's powered by either electric or battery or they have a breathing machine they could never get it wet so they had to figure out how to create\nA wheelchair that was that ... water works wheelchair oh my God so they did it and they did it like that but by using compressed air wow and now what were they need your help is they're trying to build a camp for for ... with a zip line and their ... and there are there and they're having a hard time right now trying to figure out how they can\nDo is lined with kids in wheelchairs with breathing apparatus that that is so cool\nBut you gotta watch this video of creating a post right now\nI'm time magazine actually not time magazine time magazine named one of the world's greatest places\nBut New York times did an amazing video on it and now I'll I'll tweet it or put in a ...\nIn the chat room but this guy is amazing he really the guy should run for president United States but anyway um [noise] if anyone has any advice on that that would be great advice on how to figure out how to get kids with wheelchairs up on a zip line\nOh it's just that line oh\nThat yeah well they're pretty they're pretty good because they figured out how to get them on a\nLot of water slide wow a line\nThat you don't need to take the wheelchair on the line or do you I think you do so you want to share with them\nYeah that's interesting very huh so\nWhat are you going to try that out and it's such a neat idea Morgan's in wonderland in San Antonio Texas for sharing your time magazine and yeah\nAnd then you've got to look at the New York Times' video but anyway um so then because we're so close to London six hour flight we came over here to see at least family I said I can I can work anywhere I Am I'm fortunate\nI'm so excited British Airways have nonstop flight six hours or like sixty five people on or triple seven ... and love it because then you could spread out a fire in the face of its own roe [laughter] yeah basically he did and um\n[noise] so anyway here's another website for you is is um if you want to be treated like a celebrity I don't know if you've ever seen celebrities go through airports but I see it all the time in LA when they department I transfer or when they arrive\nThey just get whisked through and so now I figured out how they do it a company approached me and they said try it out and I did it's called um black lane pass black lane pass so black guy I talked about them before because they do a car service real good car service but now\nThey have this past where they had five hundred airports worldwide\nThey will escort you so it was perfect for my mother in law because my mother in law was meeting us in London but she was flying into Heathrow reflecting the get wick and she's a little bit of a nervous traveler so I arranged for her to be\nFor a hundred dollars someone was waiting ... moments she stepped off the plane so he got a website here but you don't have to sign up ahead of time no with no clear is different clears for security and certain airports\nThis is so when she landed in London literally when they open up the door there was a there was a person they're holding a sign what's her name by they grabbed her bags they walk through they cut the line for on immigration so she'd have to wait an hour and immigration lines I Do that I think they got to deal with the costs they had to order is that\nThey often have more features they uh they do things to improve your caught activity over time as they observe what you're doing all of these things make it a better wife I experience for most people\nThere is one downside on mash up and plume started it they started charging you a yearly subscription or a monthly fee\nAnd and the idea is well look we want to keep this up to date will want to keep developing it we want to keep improving it and we're not and that's the problem right when you bought a forty dollar links this route or links is just [noise] wife their hands and said thanks good luck have fun and so uh I think it's not inappropriate for router company to say\nLook we ... you know we have additional features you can pay for euro are one of our sponsors does that as well and I pay for the euro plus\nSign up box and you get a lot of extra stuff including a password manager of VPN you get a filtering content filtering you get ad blocking and you get regular updates so that's something to be aware of mesh routers costs more basically both in initially and over time on the other hand they really do make a difference how big is the space\nAt the port in our house\nOkay so it's not a huge ... most space stations will cover that easily a single ...\nThe question or the concern that I have though is a fight with the airport three of software that through networks one but it's just one for one for the\n... noticed comments and then some of the free is much systems is that while it lasted about you can ... separate network for bigger\nYeah the idea that ... the idea behind ... is for will do it you just take it from here and I have to say in most cases unless you really know what you're doing that the best way to do it\nAt people and people can there's a lot of ... that people can think they go I'm going to choose the channel I'm going to choose the frequency I'm going to make it better and they screw things up so unless you're a network ... or ...\nOr ... yeah I have set up for it says you need it for you have to choose\nWhether ring should automatically a good ... device and I will not all of them do this but will no no that that's the two point four and beyond the two point four actually with the ... with the ... I don't think you're gonna have a problem with that um it if you it it can sometimes be a problem on some poorly designed ... stuff where they see two signals\nA five year hurts in a two point four and they choose the wrong one they can't handle it I've had that happened with a device and then you just have to reset the device and choose the other one but in a way that's more likely if you have to you know to ... to ... to two brothers one route are two different frequencies you might choose the wrong one\nAnd so I wouldn't I use the ring with ear a he's a plumber ear I use it I have both so many or at home I use the ring with the ear oh I'm In no problem but I didn't I didn't do anything special it just to automatically and then like\nA ... a ... I think it's the last one I ... I'm like\nWell I I was there have been problems with ... in some why fight or a router so you should always make sure that you choose a router that works best or works well with your ... devices and we mow I Know has had problems I Can't remember with which ones\nI Would for the size place you have\nI think you know what's nice now is some of the old school router companies like ... and ... are doing links is are doing they have you know in the in the case next next year and links as they have\n... but they're doing even in their regular you know stand alone single wife ... points they have a lot of ... features [noise] so um if you know you might look at two hundred bucks\nFrom a Amazon the neck gear night hawk that's the wire cutters pick for ... three stream a toe to toe eleven ac route or just a little it's a it's actually a one eighty five it's a little less than the old airport extreme and I would say it's very comparable to it\nAnd uh I think they're going to keep that up to date if you want to mash I Love your oh I Love the extra features of euro plus\nPlume is is good and for a certain things I use it for my generally from my I O T devices a because erode is um is very good if it's kind of small focused why\nAnd then another really good choice or is this analogy Archie twenty six hundred I think is a is a really it's two hundred bucks a really nice reverence analogy\nHas demonstrated that they will keep the software up to date they really they do network attached storage devices as well and they really seem committed to keeping stuff up today that's number that job one right now for route route or is your first line of defense against the bad guys outside so uh since ... a net here\nIf you want a ... I Love the euro you couldn't do better than zero I think a\n[noise] a ... or ...\nI ... I Would not do develop that's what we'll selling and I'm not like that that's the links is [noise]\nUh I Do not like that particularly ah I don't actually like Google's why fight either of their their um [noise] I Do not I'll tell you what I don't like it they'll do not like the ubiquity amplify\nA but there are plenty of other choices neck here's a or B is really great if you want super speed that's the best one speed wise [noise] um [noise] I Would say plume or be plumes expensive in a weird way because even though the individual units are cheap you are supposed to get one for\nEvery room so that also that\nIt adds that the\nAnd they have and as a yearly or monthly subscription yeah which is not great either so I take a look at era you don't have to buy hero plus Ninety nine bucks a year I found it well worth it\nAll the features on these new routers will be better you really will get better why fight even then the the cream of the crop apple airport extreme and that's discontinued so I don't recommend getting another one of those\nAre show they brought you buy carbon let's talk as long as we're talking security let's talk back up and data protection that's actually

had been a leap Kahn which is magically speak first big convention in a in the LA this week\nAnd uh so she had one of these creators additions and she had some games games that have been debuted this week at least ... and I got to play with it for a while now I have to say ah one of the problems with these technologies and I remember\nThis very well with the Oculus Rift in the HCC by these virtual reality headsets is initially your reaction is why I'm a woman in the future is easing\nI've got this headset on and I've been transported to another world and I can interact with it not really well

least as it stands\nToday is has is that compelling and so what I Want to be cautious when I Try on these new things like the magically thinking well you know initially I Know I'm gonna love this but it was interesting [laughter]\nAh I ... I guess the the thing that take away\nAs we're in early days yet if you are if you were shown one of the old you know asteroids games are pong games thirty or forty years ago\nAnd told you know some day people will play these for hours a day and it will they will have entire lives in these games and it'll be a multibillion dollar industry a clip seeing even the movie industry and say well\nI I don't get it [laughter] really that pong\nWere in the pong stages of augmented reality for sure but I but I I can see a little glimpse into how this might be amazing\nNicole told me she said I I I think in a year or two a year or two you'll be able to buy devices like this that the that are looked like spectacles looks like your regular glasses maybe a little bit bulkier but not much they don't look ... rock around with them\nYou see the world the world doesn't go away as one of the things I I kind of like better about augmented reality versus virtual reality virtual reality seals the world off you're blind somebody could sneak up behind you if they want you can't see anything you bump into walls augmented reality is just like sun glasses you see everything\nBut superimposed on at the real world is other stuff\nWhether it's games or information or user interface\nSo I can almost see and the sounds very good on the magically but it's really ... you know lose around you as you turn your head\nI can see that it's probably in our let's put it this way in our lifetime in the next five\nYears almost certainly people will start wearing these and by twenty thirty twenty twenty five this'll be commonplace everybody will have one just like everybody has a smartphone and it's really gonna change the way we see the world because it'll be\nAnother layer superimposed on the real world a layer of information that's always available superimposed in our vision and are hearing over the real world\nDo you get what I'm saying how this might really change everything\nKnow I I don't want to be overly enthusiastic because we've we've seen things like this that you get excited about and then just Peter out\nI don't think this one is they now call it a mixed reality that's what Microsoft calls at our ex are and so the V.

I'm just looking at my movies anywhere I'm a hundred and one movies on there because it was\nAlmost a thousand on nice it only about only about seven hundred of them show up on movies anywhere I'm like what kind of\nWeird yes that's right and uh I'm trying to remember one studio has now blocked movies anywhere\n[noise] okay to maybe Disney [laughter] because I don't know who knows you solve so confusing Disney's going to do with streaming service so there's you know there is that right it's just a it's you know\nThe problem is that ... you know people are so paranoid about piracy they really try to ... I don't blame him I completely understand 'em but at the same time it's very inconvenient and the sad thing is pirates are not inconvenienced\nThey know complete and they don't care and they know exactly how to get the movie the into the pirate channel into BitTorrent all that it's only normal people\nWere inconvenienced people who were in most cases bought the movies and just want to watch them on vacation please\nYeah well the hardest part was with a bigger but people is deciding which movie to why I bet [laughter] my favorites but I got to use a whole crowd you know\nI I Know exactly what I loved it though that Netflix and Amazon Prime both added the ability to download not all their collection but\nSome of their collection because that's really helped me a lot that makes it a lot easier to travel\nWell it does work like the ones that transfer over again from ... to groupies anywhere and then back to time I can download those there in in the primary up the ones that I own right\nSo it works out pretty good yeah that's very nice yeah and the and you know again like I said the only thing I have to keep an eye on is has it expired 'cause you have to have Internet access to to re renew it and often do\nYou see that's why I thought I could download a bunch of others on my old phone and they leave it at an airplane\nOr you can't just oh well that's interested in ...

I don't\nI see so they the office the people who own the building said and we're going to include why we're going include Internet\nCorrect I got it okay so so they're doing it OK okay\nAnd so you don't know who they are getting it from but they're getting it from a local provider of some kind of go in and then the reason they give you a hard line is because some people want to connect their computers directly\nThere's other benefits at the faster ... and some devices require not everything has wife ... okay so that's kind of normal to provide that okay\nYou have a Jack you have a Jack and what we call an ethernet Jack in the wall looks like a phone jak\nYes yes that's exactly right thank you for that yes\nOkay that's called ethernet that's uh that's always nice you pay the landlord for this Internet access or they just throw it in with the rent\nTapes rally ended shack I don't I think I'm probably gonna have to get my own\nPloy ah by the end of the ... so that's the question asked the landlord ... thank you for throwing in they'll jak which is connected to nothing [laughter] oh that was to you ask them how do you\nProvide Internet access almost certainly they don't I mean it's possible why it's pretty typical though when you read office space that that's wired up for Internet access but that you then have to go to the Internet service provider that his wired ... the place up in in by Internet from them\nOK okay quick question about that do you think it's a possibility for me to transfer my Amish start up company do you think it would be possible for me to transfer my Internet company from spectrum kill a building twenty miles away like\nProbably not so that's another question for the landlord you have to ask the landlord what Internet is available in this building\nAnd you can't transfer it to your building unless spectrum is wired that building up they may have twenty miles away is not germane one way or the other spectrum is in the neighborhood they may well have\nWe in our building for instance the studio I'm In right now we have the local cable company wired up they have there's a closet with all of these connections\nIn part of the building and the cable companies there so it was a local a fiber optic Internet service provider called sonic that I think there's other companies as well and they're all in the closet and then you go to whichever company you want to use it has to be one of the ones in the closet and say this one is the one I'd like in my office\nSo you okay do I I think you're going to want to talk to the landlord and say tell me which one of my choices if it's spectrum you could add it to your existing spectrum service perhaps [noise] usually\nCable companies charge differently in charge a lot more for business connections that homo yeah oh yeah so uh but you and you want business Internet because there's you know that they're usually the qualities better et cetera et cetera\nOr do you should see what the choices are and then you might want to do some research by calling the different companies available to you just like when you buy a\nHouse or rent an apartment you ask the previous owners of the landlord well what kind of Internet you get here and uh and they'll tell you what stuff's been brought in from the curb and that's the same thing from a landlord was ... what is available to me on that jak you put in my office\nAnd then I bet you unless for some reason they're the nicest landlords in the world and they just said you know what we're going to pay all the tendons Internet access most likely they'll say okay you have these choices\nI Would do some research to see what business and in that cost and what you get\nWhat event happen is they'll wired up\nThey may or may not come into your office in wired up probably what they'll do is if you've got an eastern jak in your office they'll just what they do they call it lighted up\nThey'll connected in that closet there's all those ethernet jacks go into that closet and they'll connect that line in your office to the one that's coming into the building into the closet they'll connect those now you're on that company's Internet\nAnd then what you're going to probably have to do is bio why fire router\nThat was gonna say Chili's\nWe did that and and I found a company that was fired into their wives that would necessarily be the why fight that they're\nNo that's great oh they offer you a free why fine\nFor unlimited device\nNice that's I is it from who's it from say curiosities it from the company that the rent see the building or\nYou know why it at that company puts it in the contract and that\nSo that might be all you need it depends on how fast it is there are things to be considering\nOkay we have an inside office so I'm not I'm On an outer\nWall when does cut back on this loud", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "Mobile", "day": "14"}
