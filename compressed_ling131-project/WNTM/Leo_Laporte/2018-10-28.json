X. I. F.\nThat whole things like the location data that's turned on a date and time of capture stuff like that and there's an even further standard called I. P. T. see that as a comes from the wire agencies that can allow you to do even more data titles and ... and all sorts of stuff there's another\nUh you know a ... there's other information in there besides just the photo like icy see information so all of this is a is great uh information and most photo library\nPrograms will automatically import that data and use it you could sort by date and so forth sometimes is you've got tags and there you can do searching I met her I don't know have you tried photo me\n[noise] a\nTry this one it's free so I like it it's from Germany and you know the Germans do good stuff\nWell if if I Would like to I went through ... and I cried about a dozen of them so I very well\nCould have his eye you might have it it's a fairly old one I haven't used it in a while but in fact I think I hate to say at\nThe ... in that might be for windows me which would be a terrible terrible thing I don't know what I what I typically will do a is do it within like ... because that's what I used to process my photos and it has gives you access to all the ex if they were alive\nI own light room I guess one of these days I'll have to learn how to use\nKind of a a ... a a Canada shoot a horse fly I don't think you need to just for ... anybody in the chat room have a a a favored or exit editor I Would try this photo meets photo meat dot D. E.\n[noise] um I've also used I'm trying to remember I don't think I've used on windows it might be on the Mac but there are a number of programs that let you quickly import raw images because light room is very bad at a raw and I've used a program called fast raw viewer\nAnd I'm pretty sure yet for windows as well now it's not free but I'm pretty sure fast raw viewer will also let you modify the uh the taxi ... tags in there\nSo you can try before you buy it's fast raw viewer dot com and that is kept up to date that is a very up to date program\nAnd the reason I like it is because light room it's so slow yeah my raw photos on some of my cameras or forty two megabytes they're very very big files and so a PR image so it takes a while for like a new loaded and display it fast reviewers designed to really get you to quickly go through your photos\nAnd uh and pick the ones you liked but it also gives you full access to the I.

it's very much being studied and with some success and the question is what it is what's off or are they using how are they doing it and how does it work and this ah this this article I think you'll find a little more informative a than a newspaper article about this um\nProgram called ... that they use evidently yeah it does is it occupies the line and such a way it and at the same time transfer pain signals to the ... yeah\n[noise] so they they they mentioned in his in his scholarly paper that the number of an age funded studies investigating the use of E R for pain management has doubled\nOr this you know they're ... they're you know one of the techniques is biofeedback you know deep breathing with stuff that we know is already worked but using VR a or B R plus hypnosis VR plus breathing exercises\nSeem to have some some results I've also seen V. are used in treatment of Pete TST post traumatic stress disorder\nAnd that seems to also be a effective I you know I always would caution VR is the hottest thing in technology today and so I always caution a little bit um you know when it's the the the flavor of the month that you know there's\nBut I does it is very
