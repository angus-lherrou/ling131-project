All right they had a big event to show off new hardware new surface pros and surface laptops studios and so forth and at the event they said and today we're proud to say we will begin pushing out\nThe new feature update they call it Eighteen own mind 'cause in the September twenty Eighteen except October but it's close enough so that's it you know nine\nLast one was Eighteen of three but it came out in may so\nEight five but ... but anybody that don't pay no attention to the numbers that's not the most important thing the most important thing is is it you know these they do these a couple of times a year and windows and remember they said when does tend to last version of windows were not going to a ship all windows eleven\nWe're just gonna keep updating keep improving windows tan and we're going to do that to three times a year it's turned out to be really two times a year with these big feature updates\nExcept that almost immediately people started saying whoa that feature up I stole the Wii job they believe in all my documents one guy in the Microsoft\nSupport board said\nI had two hundred twenty gigabytes of documents and my documents folders\nGone well\nThat doesn't seem like a behavior but it also seems weird because Microsoft has tested as as they have in the past with millions of people\nThe current you know eight nine has been tested for six months work their tests and the next one already with these people who volunteer maybe you're one of them it's a windows insider program\nYou'd think if this thing did that except maybe the installers the last piece of the puzzle right maybe they didn't even really testing the installer so maybe they did you know forget to tested thoroughly high on no anyway Microsoft and they have pulled back Eighteen online\nSo um\nYou won't be able to get a teen how nine if you were all excited about it [noise] probably few people have all the way it generally works it was assumed that they Microsoft wasn't going to start kind of\nSaying you know you know how they do that with pop ups hey there's a new version windows one installed they until Tuesday till patch Tuesday so that people who got it or what Microsoft calls seekers I Am a seeker I'm a seeker of truth of wisdom end of windows updates\nAnd I got it because if you went to windows update and actively said what's that what's new anything now it would say well yeah there's this new feature update you want it\nI installed it on at least three\nComputers by Lenovo that I have in front of me the AT T for Seventy yes last year as a laptop I installed it on a

some people didn't have that problem not unknown why hope you didn't and don't worry Microsoft is pausing they say that's the word they're not pulling it back then that withdrawing pausing pausing

problem is cable company in it if it wisdom went all digital and now they charge from you have to have a box for every TV so I've got far TVs I ... I Need to extend my wife fight so that I can get a\nFire sticks or something like that for the other team ease right and they can uh do it but I don't know what kind of range extender I Need or if there's a better brand or I mean\n[noise] yeah this is a\n... am I saying are the most out the whole thing\nBe why are the whole house horse but who's going to do that nobody let's go on the addict yeah yeah yeah of course\nYeah I I keep I'm tempted to do that in my house in the crawl space underneath here in California we tend to be you have no basements but at least we have little crawl spaces underneath but then who wants to go under there that's even worse me addict\n[laughter] lighter so or or or worse [laughter] the cable companies took advantage\nOf the FCC when the FCC made over the television stations go digital some years ago and remember there was a big thing about it and you had to get a digital Turner and stuff the cable companies pretended that this was a requirement for them to and took advantage of and they all went digital or there's advantages for them they can\nGet more a signal down the line you know analog uses a lot more bandwidth than just getting digital packets on there so you get more channels et cetera et cetera et cetera\nUh but of course at this point I'm ... everybody's looking for is to just do it over the top that's called when you use the Internet to get your television they call it over the top\nOr you're going over your going over and above your cable companies own offerings and TV saying I'm going to do it myself on a fire t._v. or Roku or an Apple TV or you know YouTube TV or whatever\nThey do that you need first of all good Internet I presume you're getting that at the router and then that Internet needs to get to all the other TVs in the house and that can sometimes be Alan ...\nExactly it's not terrible my daughter uses her laptop in the back room and streams some stuff but there's a lot of offering\nYeah what you'll notice on why fires the farther you get the less signal you get and throat I signal you get the less speed you get it's a direct correlation so\nWe want to boost the signal now uh it depends on what you're using as a wife I access point if you're using a modern access point that has they do to to eleven they see are you\nHere me on ...\nMike yeah but yeah how recently did you by your accent or megabytes how recently a decent\nWhy why it's not the ESL um [noise] it's just that uh they also have the the the lock on that as well we're very rural so the only choice we\nHad oh it's from the cable guy I got it yeah yeah that makes it more complicated now what I Would recommend and most cable companies will let you do this I don't know if yours will ... cable company but if if they do the best thing to do is to use their cable modem and provide your own wife ... router\nI did I did do that\nYeah okay good so you ... ... if they if they're cable modem has a wife by a part part of it you know a router part of it just disable that or to at least turn off the wife five radio\nIf you could turn off the wife by radio that all lemonade signal congestion and then you have to put the wife I rather than what we call bridge mode say let the cable modem route or because they're still around her and they decide what IP address as we all get but I'm going to use you for why find that usually works pretty well\nYour best way to do this is with the more modern mesh why fight routers um erode sponsor of ours is a big name but there are plenty of these or be from a ... year a veil up from is that links is I can never remember\nThere's a there's a whole bunch of strange names for these things and these ... are designed for challenging why fire environments they have a base unit\nSometimes the same as all the other units sometimes different from other areas and then they have sub units typically you buy a a a little sub unit for every Fifteen hundred square feet although you if you have a challenging environment with multi levels that kind of thing you might might buy more\nAnd and these these little extra units are are like repeaters but they're better than\nSo you can get a repeat or for your existing non mesh system but what will happen is the repeaters takes half of the time talking to the route the base station and the other half the time talking to you so we all wife I extenders\nCut wife I speed in half wow\nThat's the nature of a wife I extend or because they can't operate in what we call full duplex smoke they can't they can't do two things at once they can only either talk to the route or talk to you so that's split than a half\nThe ... have a back channel this is the ... the main difference\nHave a back channel they use to communicate with the base station it doesn't slowed down so the ... and this is why it's the best solution for somebody who's trying to expand their wife five foot print and plume is another one that's uh that's I use both plume an arrow in my house there lots of companies all you have to look for mesh\nUm the problem is the expense because you're not only buying a base unit you're going to buy one or two or three extra extenders in the end they usually start at three hundred dollars and uh they go up usually rent a hundred hundred and fifty bucks per extender\nSo you have no but if they ... outlook probably really solve the problem and some of them are most\nOf them have additional features for instance zeroes a\nHave if you pay extra I think it's a hundred bucks a year you're oh plus which has filtering so it keeps your kids off of that site that has things like you could say to your echo pause a juniors why fight in his will go off\nUm and you get yours will continue they have lots of nice features guest they have guests networks they really is\n[laughter] losing them all the time because of lack of oxygen into my brain so a lot to make an excuse for it though you don't have to\nMake excuses and by the way everybody forgets the code six\nSix December and that's part of my problem to the older you get the more you have problems remembering things that's bad enough but hey\nDon't don't don't apologize Robert I'm catching up with you so here's here's the deal or is it the thing that the code you enter when you first this you know the turn on the phone you have to honor code to get into it like okay\nSo on these older Android phones they're not quite as secure an iPhone you might be a little bit more a challenge because apple really locks these things down but on an Android phone or if you don't mind doing it the easiest thing is to erase it and start over do you mind doing that though I don't mind that at all\nOkay so it's going to depend on the phone but almost you know what I Will say all Android phones have a way to get into recovery mode\nNow the easiest way is of course if your phone is unlocked you can do it right from the settings but your phone is locked so what you want to do is reset it without unlocking it and you can do that but you're going to have to figure out\nYou know inject here's the first thing I'd try it works on most Android phones you press it hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time and they'll put you in recovery mode and that works on almost all Android phones\nIt can't promise it'll work on yours and what you might end up having to do is Google\nYour manufacturer and model and the word reset or factory reset and there may be a different command for say the al ... cells or whatever but what the what what the command in in my case of pressing the power button\nAnd you have to kind of it might be a little tricky 'cause you have to do it and they're you know just kind of at the same time and volume up button and you have to\nYou said volume up and power at the same ... yeah and you can you hold it and then once you ... at some point you might have to turn it off first and you could do that by even if it's locked by pressing in holding the power off button\nSo power power at all the way down then press the power in volume button together\nAnd you'll see you should see on most of these phones they used a text based menu that's the recovery mode\nAnd I'll tell you how you navigate that you move the volume button up or down through the menu and then you press the power button select and so you're going to select reset and a reset will just a race to phone take it back as if you just bought it which actually isn't a bad thing to do once in a while\nI did just buy it at all I did was get it able to connect to my wife by that I hadn't done anything else so I won't worry about losing any\nTray perfect perfect and then now some people are going to yell at me when I say this but I honestly think this is perfectly fine you don't have a lot of strangers coming and going in your house do you narrow\nZero so it's okay it's perfectly fine to write passwords down a ... the only issue would be if somebody could get access to the notebook to your writing it right but as long as people aren't going\nTo have to get past my three fifty seven first\nOkay that sounds pretty good\nI won't be breaking in Robert ... actually it yeah here in Florida so uh you you have you have a lot you have the stand and\nStanding cocker lawyers your great so [laughter] so what I Would do is get up and get a new book I I've actually I've actually seen these in I'm In the like the targets and stuff they this is I don't know if there's a good idea but I see no books has said passwords\nOn the front of it in gold letters that's kind of an announcement to get this no but but maybe don't have one that says ... get a new book that you know and you keep it in your desk drawer and anytime you set a code a password whatever\nJust write it down okay that's your password fall\nThere was a second issue with them is they always want to keep up dating just the apps that came with it right\nAnd they only have eight gig on eight ... gigabytes of hard drives space and only one gig of memory and I'm always getting low memory and out of space\nMemory every time they do an update their updates through at least twenty to thirty gigabytes it's ... I'm Sorry yeah and that adds up over time when you're getting a little frequently yeah so\nBut you don't want to let me tell you you do want those updates wherever you really do I know yeah I don't worry about the low memory a ... most of the time those updates update you know they'll downloaded first and that may be where you get that warning but as soon as the updates done to delete it and they'll have not occupy any more than they currently do\nMost of the time updates don't add to this amount of size of these apps or the or the operating system but they are very important as long as you can run them as long as it happens it's okay\nIt does leave downloaded folder the at the ... or the update that you download it and you can delete that okay\nYeah it will delete it by ... automatically oh oh okay yeah I Know windows they always do that oh that's\nRight windows does not it as soon as you have a lot of room but Android understands it in many cases the spaces scanned so it it will delete those don't you worry and if it doesn't you can't go in the downloads folder and and with impunity delete anything that's stuck there\nIt can handle up to a thirty two gigabytes card\nOh well that's another solution now the thing about cards to remember is when you install one of those cards most of the time apps and the operating system they don't live on the card\nBut what you can do I don't know if you're using it for music you can move music there you can move pictures there any media\nAny data files can be moved to the external card and that will free up space uh once you put in the card for instance the camera will say oh I see of a card you want to put pictures there and you just say yes and that will free of space but it doesn't you can't put apps there\nRobert it's great to talk to you again keep calling okay love hearing from your point the three fifty seven the other way fuel our show they brought you buy carbon I\n... the premier data

[noise]\nFor our radio seven ten WINZ em\n\nHey you've heard me talk a lot about ... tank printers you're about to hear me again because the ... tank forty seven fifty is downright revolutionary there's a wireless on one printed doesn't use ink cartridges that means no more last minute runs to the store late night free gas because you've run out of ink\nHe could take forty seven fifty as easy to fill in the tanks and get this they print up to eleven thousand color pages\nThat so much ink you get in the box it's equivalent to thirty encourage says that's if you had to buy the it'd be about Fifteen hundred bucks the saves you money saved your time and when they say all in one apps and means that the ups and he could take forty seven fifty\nArchitecture and landscapes you know taking and and if we're portrait sure you want a slightly longer lands maybe uh eighty five millimeter lens\nOr they can handle low light and that way you can get great portraits or with great depth of field you know the background kind of fades away and the editor of portrait pops out so each lands has different features different attributes a lot of photographic a teacher's suggest however\nAnd you know the temptation is going to be the get the kit lands which usually the twenty wide goes wide just kind of ... somewhat telephoto twenty\nFour to seven tier ... something like that uh [noise] that is a nice all purpose lens a lot of\nTeachers suggests starting with a single prime lands of fifty millimeter LEDs which approximate the guy\nAnd really teaches composition because\nInstead of just zooming in and out you actually have to think about it move closer move farther away really think about what you're getting\nThat's going to be up to you and your daughter she's going to say no dad I don't want to have to do all that I just want one lens and and and then you're then you're kind of yeah you get one zoom lens the kit lands and then the question is well what do I need any other less for it at all\nI liked the idea of having a good low light they they tend to be more expensive the the the the how much light gathering is determined by the what we call the aperture how big the opening can get and it's it's it's it's an inverse\nSo the lower the F stop the wider the aperture so when you see a lens that can do F. one point a to F one point I even at one point for\nThose are lenses that have a wider can go wider opening and capture more light which means they're great for not using flash for for getting a natural images they're great for torture they\nTend to be more expensive and you'll never see assume we call it a fast lands but it can do that you know every season that fast\nBecause it's just too expensive a fast zoom is maybe two point four three point five something like that okay okay so I\nThink about instead of getting the kid getting a body and then getting a nice say at one point for fifty millimeter lands I think that would be a great teaching lands but you've got to talk to her and she's got to agree with you\nAs far as which body to get it this is an important decision because if you're getting an interchangeable lens camera you're buying into a system if you get a cannon or an icon you're going to be going cannon or an icon lenses forever after you know because they have custom mounts each of them\nSo you're making a decision in that regard right now I'm a kind of a fan of the night cons ah I was a cannon shooter for years and actually I currently should Sony's which are mirror lists\nUh but but for her first camera maybe an icon deeds thirty five hundred a this is a good ... camera it's who you know it starts at five hundred bucks\nOkay uh it is the sensors size is another thing that people often talk about\nThis is an A. P. S. C. center which is a large censor but not full framed full framed gets very expensive ultimately that's what she's going to want but I think this the deep thirty five hundred is a very nice very high quality camera or you could buy a kit get the twenty four seven the lands that goes with the kid a it is\nHere's what I Would do is the other thing you can look at is deep he reviewed dot com digital photography review dot com\nThey have a best camera for beginners buying guide that we'll talk about the pros and cons they liked the can and then when you were looking at the ios rebel ... to ... uh that's another very nice one but that talk about the pros and cons of each\nAnd I'm going to throw in one third one that is to me are the most flexible\nSolution which is an Olympic is only MD now this is a smaller censor it some ... what we call micro for third censor the micro for thirds cameras have one big advantage many companies make the lenses so you have many of literally hundreds of choices of lenses\nAnd that is kind of nice my wife shoots it on the ah E. M. five I think more mark or I Can't remember ... years of the um on him one mark five something like that\nAnyway it's a very ... compact they are interchangeable ends and you have a huge number of choices of lenses so I Would I go to deep you review read the beginner best camera for beginners buying guide they also have a best camera for students guide\nA and that will give you some more information um the the three cameras I've mentioned here are absolutely top of the line cameras and it's a great project for her to be involved in it unless you want to do it as a Christmas gift\nYeah okay and I think she would like to be ... yeah what's\nYour thoughts about any advantages of a picking up some specifically a a ... give a brand name a number a Amazon versus a local camera store\nAs

mentioned try booting I presume the windows in two different versions of clinics and that's the other beauty of links as there are many many versions hundreds\nAnd hundreds of them you can go to a

they've based it on Debbie in a ... there'll be an is my favorite kind of Linux because his community supported it is not\nOwned by a company will boon to which is owned by a company is based on Debbie in men is based on a boon to so it's based on Debbie in two removes a I think the same thing for\nA elementary owe us but he lives started with Debbie in and they use the enlightenment desktop which is an interesting choice but they made it quite beautiful uh it it just looking at I I've yet to install it I'm going to have to do it\nBut that would be one certainly to try and that's the other thing is great about Linux and I know you agree lazy 'cause easy to try him\nYeah and if it's got to live version then you could just food into it\nDoes yeah all the Knicks has now become live versions so\nI Would in fact they even on the ... website they show it running on an IMAX so [laughter]\nI take an old max it's hard to get Linux working well on back in my opinion yeah you're better off doing what you do which is by refurbished when ... you're dealt I\nOther great machines I mean they they go for like five seven processors they're like the machine she got a brand new but there to to you know three four years old\nIn a way with Linux you want it that way because the the as machines get older they're more likely to be supported you know it takes a little times of brand new machine often as as well supported by what next\nBut I what I generally do it cause I buy you know one or two just for review purposes or one or two new windows laptops a year sometimes more\nWhen they get to be a year or two old just like you instead of buying referred by just take mine that I put limits on them I just put limits on my ... a second generation Lenovo Yoga and it runs view to\nFlee the excellent yoga it's just a gorgeous machine made even more gorgeous\nMy favorite Linux the one I use personally is based on arch Linux another very good community supported distribution\nIt's a little different than Debbie and Debbie in is more stable arch is what we call it rolling update so it is constantly updated in ... that's probably not best for beginners a buddies is but I like to have the latest versions of everything on my systems that most\nPeople I talked to a all they want is a [noise]\nA rock solid secure platform they crash\nOr they want some word processing and then\nThere is a free officers Lieber office which is really good and does look a lot like Microsoft Office um the browsers are the same you can use you know Firefox or a chromium which is the open source version of crime and\nIt's exactly the same as Firefox or chrome on a windows or Mac so they're ... they they generally the email is not what do you use for email on a for these people is there a particular program you like\nA well I'm usually on a Sunday\nBrunch pretty good I like claws but I don't know uh if clause is a good choice for novices I don't find that a a

I was a hot spot to remind\nAha so using the ... yes so that's exactly why so um this is this is unfortunately and it's not an issue in the phone every iPhone has GPS built in\n... I parents do not unless you get one with a cellular ship in it the sale your ship as a single chip that has both radios for GPS and LT and so that's the problem precisely is that the ... the er I pat I'm fact I'm kind of impressed the I've had been kind of figure out where you are\nIt's doing that by triangulating why fi access points and if you get out in the country where there's no why fight you won't know where you are\nWell it's a little slow sometimes you missed the terms\nBefore you really yeah we're really in your phone is reliable 'cause it's using GPS Wright Patt is not okay\nIt does it does the location is actually clever a trick that ah ah apple users Google used it was a company called sky hook that pioneered this they drove ... a lot of cars around with GPS is it said I notice\nWhen I'm Fifteen feet from wife I access point a twelve feet from access point B and a hundred feet from Akron points see I'm here\nAnd it may literally made a map\nTriangulating all the Y in almost everywhere in the country and then selling that to Google and apple apple and Google Now do that themselves with their own cars but uh that's a very clever technology but it's not perfect obviously\nInteresting so if I bought an eye pad than had the GPS ... he wouldn't\nBe a lawyer trick is your next type pet and good news apples probably coming out with I had this month for a get one within ... chip then you don't have to you I mean you're still going to have to pay for an out to eat connection that's a pain for a but you'll have that way you won't have to pay for it to the phone for the data and it'll have GPS will be accurate [noise]\nSounds like a solution I thought maybe I was missing something\nA ... year it was yeah to bed at just the way it is\nNot a problem and the reason\nIs that Israel is right ... thanks for the call is very simple to\nThe to chip that apple puts in\nProbably ... was from Qualcomm nowadays I guess it's from into a is a dual purpose chip does GPS and Internet\nOr and so they just don't they just don't put that and now they're going to they're going to release I'm almost certain there's lots of evidence that they are going to release new I ... this year probably knew I had pros\nOr remember that Apple's latest phones all the phones is you have a new interface they don't have a home button they don't have a fingerprint reader they face i._d.\nAnd they have new ways of swiping and swooping in looping to control the thing because you don't have a home buttons you swipe up to go home and all that\nAh apple is going to inevitably move everything to the end of the first I think the first step there will be these new I passed it they'll release now we have an event no one knows\nThere's no consensus on this or they are also expected to release new Mac or platforms probably not the new ... crow but I Know you know we're looking for frankly a Mac book air in a ... book replacement of some kind\nAnd uh that would also probably come out new air pods\nThat that there's some evidence that they're they're going to upgrade the air pods yeah a partly because they've been deeply discounted by a lot of merchants not apple but others that usually means are out there and clearing them out for the new ones\nSo it's enough new stuff they could have an\nEvent but I in my gut is there not it'll just it'll just appear there'll be a press release most people think it'd be later this month closer to Halloween but if you're in the market for an eye pet it would be prudent at this point or air pods or ... ... it would be prudent to wait till the in the month see what apple has to say\nAs usual we have to wait and they don't tell us um let's see here that was a Dave in Sarasota wasn't it yeah now I blew it salmon west covina hello Sam [noise]\nToy Leo come on over I'm well how are you [noise] um good good thank you for taking my call on this question though sure um I just picked up ... congratulations on the law but thank you thank you a credible machine oh yeah\nI'm the feel my life so I don't know what the heck I'm doing with it [laughter]\nThey won't take long they're not they're not so very different they all have the same heritage you know my\nMy kids are the ones teaching make right now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "Mobile", "day": "07"}
