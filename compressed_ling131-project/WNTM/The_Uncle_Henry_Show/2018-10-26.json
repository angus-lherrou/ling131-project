violation\nAnd were given thirty days to relocate the junk down vehicle all costs will be assessed against the vehicle as a lean in after sixty days at the impound ... the vehicle will be sold a public option earlier this year the city passed\nNew legislation too big into wing inoperable abandon junk vehicles that have been in the same location for at least thirty days\n\nAs a result of the new process for vehicles have been voluntarily removed one vehicle was repaired\nSo they are trying to to create an event over the telling of junk to car to to stimulate other junk car owners to get rid of their junk cars\n\nSo I'm looking forward to now will we hear\nA backlash from people that love having junk cars which I Know sounds silly but I've known in lived next door\nTo people that just loved to have an inoperable junk cars that when you looked at him you instinctively could tail even if you weren't a mechanic the this vehicle will never move ever again unless somebody cards at all\n\nIn fact I grew up next door to somebody that had a junk car\nThat was there for over a decade that as children we played in the joke or it was that was our playground equipment we had a

children\n\nAnd the only toys we had were the basketball and football no baseball or baseball bat\nSo we had basketball football time cones sticks and dirt and dirt lodge those were toys\nAnd we had the junk card to play in because you would you use the junk car if somebody was throwing the dirt Claude out you or the pine cones at you you die behind the junk car and it provided a barrier\nYou could use it strategically\nSo there are people that love their drum corps so this will be I Hope that the media does go out and get us a video\nOf the junk heart towing and will we hear about the backlash\nOh and by the way the mayor goes on to say about removing the junk cars we will increase property values and revitalize our neighborhoods [noise]\nBut\nWhat will not hide behind if

B. U. V. in Biloxi\nAnd news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the dragon mobiles Web news headlines in ten minutes for you right now we want to welcome to the Gulf Coast mornings national correspondent bills for building morning to you\nGood morning uncle Henry come on and how you doing\nWe're doing great uh so the story that top story in the country right now all these mysterious packages what is the latest\nWell the latest is they they are making progress in probably more progress than uh thirties want us to know about at this point but the latest is that yeah things are kind of centered on a postal facility in ... Florida just north of Miami\nThey say now that at least several of these packages that ten packages that have been discovered now\nTravel through this facility which is a a packaging sorting processing facility which is a huge\nPostal operation but this was a big development because they can now a track the movements of these packages and maybe even get back to the point of origin which could lead to a video surveillance of who May of actually put this package\nIn the mail to begin with their even self service kiosks at this facility a there where people can drop packages so all of those things will now be examined and could lead to the people ultimately responsible\nThe other part of his uncle Henry is the devices themselves continue to be analyzed at the uh terrorist explosive device analytical center down at Quantico\nAnd uh at this point there appears to be more evidence or getting a lot of reports that these devices would not have gone off that are they in some cases contained pyrotechnics element like out it might be anything from a gunpowder to a phosphorus to\nA chauffeur based type of substance but uh there was no apparent triggering mechanism meaning that uh they're yeah they they could have been dangerous but there is nothing there that would have made them go off\nThey'll ship or is it likely that there are other packages that haven't been found yet\nAuthorities say we have to be wary of this and we had some false alarms yesterday or last night that building the CNN and his and in New York City was a part of it was a evacuated again where they uh\nA false alarm they say there may still be more out there even though it's been twenty four hours now a and that they say they must be considered viable explosives that they are potentially destructive devices even though as I said the evidence seems to be mounting that these would not have gone off\nSo we've uh with the twenty four hour news networks you get a few facts and then you you're left with twenty three hours of speculation yeah a has any of the is any of the speculation uh been on target to or I I've heard the interesting theory or that it could be a foreign entity\nYeah I I think that has to be considered here especially due to the fact that this\nCould be considered another form of election meddling so to speak and we've heard a lot about that through social media and such but does this could be considered another form of that just to throw the whole process into a little bit more of mayhem and\nTo fuel speculation on both sides whether it be a Republican or Democrat or right wing or left wing fuel a speculation and rumors on both sides as to who might be responsible for this and to create more of a divide\nA than we already have in this country between between the political parties so I think that that is a viable explanation I'm sure it's something that the authorities are looking into\nSo bills for you you mentioned that there's a lot that the authorities know and they're probably not letting us know yet or is there any any timeline that we can count on should we should we expect us to be resolved a week from now\nThis is also interesting uh I Believe that the investigation is ... is progressing quick enough that we could have a an arrest some time and the next week or so but there is now some speculation uncle Henry that if there is an arrest made that\nThe tails of it would not be released until after the midterm elections are so as not to fuel a the the ire of one party or the or another or to damage or either party before the midterm elections now that is completely\nA unsubstantiated at this point but it is certainly something that a is an interesting aspect of this whole thing\nWell and that's something that I also wondered about because certainly or if there's an indication that that whoever did this he's leaning really hard in one direction or the other politically um the the opposing sides going to want to make the most of that\nYeah especially to if this is I mean as we've heard some speculate that this was a democratic hopes\nThat it actually is democratic supporters who wanted to create this situation in order to damage the Republican Party is found out that that is the reason for this or it could have an impact on their mid term elections so yeah that's that's a question to keep in mind as we move ahead but I think this investigation is moving\nAhead fast enough that we could have\nA some action taken in the next week or so\nWhere we're at a time bills for thank you You're welcome have a great weekend you to\n... billion for NBC News radio Kelly been at just imagine we have all this going on a before the midterm can you imagine what it's going to be like in our next election

B. U. V. in Biloxi and our news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the jag immobile news headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news when a welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings Darwin singleton of NBC Fifteen\nDo a good morning\nGood morning I Hope you guys are having a great friday you know the rains out of the way we can certain joining the fair weather and Halloween whether\nAbsolutely absolutely yes yes and\nAnd not quite Mardi Gras weather but but we're getting there too or part maybe three months away\nYeah yeah yeah I saw the story that NBC Fifteen had you had Cassie Pham real reporting on this where are the the the mayor's administration immobile had some discussions with parade organizations about going up on the parading face for Mardi Gras\nYou've heard masks hitting the floor along with chickens when that happened and I just [laughter]\nNot just by a couple of dollars either by ah they usually charged about a thousand or so I think it's twenty five dollars processing fee or something like that to five grand was the suggestion a and some of these crews\nAre are not wealthy cruise I mean in fact I hear that story I'm hearing a lot of stuff from inside that meeting now which by the way a lot of people didn't know what it's about they showed up [noise] um\nI think it was uh about ten groups are so said that they they wouldn't be able to parade if they did that and we were very close to Mardi Gras right now so what basically happened after we aired our store yesterday we got a call from the mayor's office says nothing's going to be done before the twenty ninth team parades role but they're looking at it\nAnd I'm also hearing they ask them how much they could pay and some of them say well maybe five hundred but not five grand you know an increase [noise] so uh but but I Will Henry you know some of these new groups are Mardi Gras is grown some of these new groups are actually\nRent their floats they parade with other organizations because they don't they're not big enough they can't afford it and some of the newer parades a are\nEither a ... they're either mixed race or they're a minority members are members of the American\nCommunity right at that\nBecause it's been basically white organizations downtown so we're going to do if some of these have can't afford it then you're going to basically return downtown parades to just basically an all white a bit except you know as far as participants in the parade\n[noise] that's about the direction that the city was going no\nAnd I don't think they thought about that I don't know if they have it out if they're trying to save the hurt because they feel they have Jimmy parades but that's what will happen\nBut Darwin that is that is a big consideration one that I hadn't even considered until you just brought it up but when I saw this story I\nJust remembered for I Would say most of my life living in this area I have heard arguments about how big an economic impact Mardi Gras has\nAnd how we we generate all this money is generated with people coming into town staying in a hotel spending so much money involving Mardi Gras\nIf that's true why would you ever go up on the parade the\nWell here's the deal it costs the ... the police cheap told us last night it costs about forty one thousand dollars for the city to throw a parade every night during Mardi Gras about forty one grand as that sounds like a lot of money [noise] uh but there was a study done back in two thousand for\nA and I found it this morning on of all things a mobile carnival museum site and I think Steve joint ... mass is the story several years ago or ... maybe the mother pressed register did it but it's been quoted by ... there'll be a mask or that shows the tremendous hundreds hundreds of millions of dollars\nThat are spit immobile involving county\nOn Mardi Gras and then when you multiply it by\nA by how it's spent over and over a you're getting your getting toward a billion bucks and\nIt also represents about a six percent of the entire states a tourism or a ... income it's it's it's huge I mean I I Know mobile gets an amazing amount of hotel money and a tax dollars are just ...\nOh a income at ... sorry sales tax in its Sunday most cities would gladly at best and so and of course I'm a Mardi Gras fan I'll bet it's I'm a big supporter of the of the the crews and ... that event itself\nAnd everybody knows that there's no secret so it it it ... sounds mean to to try to figure out why you\nWould bite the hand that teaches\nYou yeah and not only that but Darwin come on I mean a little increase I can understand like twenty fifty bucks or something like that but didn't jump from a thousand five thousand and one meeting one\nYeah they'll they're and I understand they they said also okay if you can't pay that how much you pay and\nI said well we must figure you know maybe five hundred bucks we certainly can't do that kind of at\nGreat well yeah I just I I'm I'm back to the to the to the basic why would you if it generates just what you you mentioned that about that study from a few years ago why on earth would you ever that you should go somewhere else to find whatever money you're looking for because this yes Kelly ...\nShouldn't you love the fee to make the veil even bigger\nWell yeah I I it it is already big but I mean look at all and I we always say look at New Orleans I mean\nI'm sure that they pay quite a bit of this but there are cities built on that if you want to see that study that read that story I've got it on my uh NBC fifteenth by station's
