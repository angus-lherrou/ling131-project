{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "Well that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nWhat was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one will probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\nYeah after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see that kind of his absence\nCome up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow can we never wrote a book\nWell he never a novel he did write your collection of short stories\nAnd don'ts for sure but I'm getting the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary um some but she never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away\nFor long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThat there's going to be a ... to the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out\nOr is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it and from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for it where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kind of thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be re Andrew reintroduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wandering around surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was\nHe didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is\nWritten by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a coke credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I I clarify in the book\nBecause some of these is shows whether it was not gallery or twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it that he was a\nHe you know Carol certainly was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer the gift she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of\nYou know the crop circles and you know we only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff but he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own you'd never saw a spaceship or\nAnything like that so he was always skeptical but\nBut he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of and during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a a true believer or anything like that\nNow the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of 'em yeah back then now nowadays a thirty minute she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod Serling could write a story and a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often a complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he\nUm he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said there are so they're so different it was very hard to to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know\nTo throw a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype all you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know religious youth and go back to a easier less stressful life wasn't Willoughby\nOr it's just like really as kind of a stop at Willoughby of kind of a companion piece to its well distance yeah so they both very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme for Serling was this idea of going back to his innocent youth in in Binghamton New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric or to serve man that was a classic a\nMan is yeah absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still know to this day they know that anything it's a cookbook you know they that's that's the river [laughter]\nAnd uh they're just so many good the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the uh he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a ever flown who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nUh he started that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he got ... kind of direct Las Vegas and he became a you know addicted to this one particular slot machine that he thinks is taunting him\nA drove him crazy after a while the ... exactly right yeah All right\nNick

question we're putting every resource we can into getting caught up and we'll get there\nNo jelly Bennett there is a conspiracy theory\nWhat they can speak yes there's a conspiracy theory that has

in an impasse we most privatized this in an outsource this to a private company now that's not no one is officially said that it's just a conspiracy theory one of the people the leaves the conspiracy theory is a mobile city councilman\nHere as mobile city councilman Fred Richardson from yesterday's meeting\nEventually what I see is that America come for us so we can no longer pick a threat and we

N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the dragon mobiles news headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want\nTo welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent builds Oprah bill good morning\nThe morning I'll go and read them on and Kelly\nThere's a there's a virus that isn't\nI think kids in the country a lot of people very worried about this\nYeah and the CDC is also concerned about it even though at this point it is still very rare the numbers nationwide or not huge but it is concerning for a couple of reasons number one\nAs you mentioned all go Henry it it really it targets children uh the average age of those who have come down with this illness which is a called a cute flaps admire light is or a F. M.\nOr the average age is four years old and Ninety percent of the cases I had been found in those Eighteen years old and younger the other part of it is that right now they have no idea what is causing this and it has shown up\nBasically nationwide while I said they're not a huge number of cases right now\nOr they're looking at a hundred twenty seven cases across the country it goes from New Jersey to California to Alabama or they have some cases that are under investigation there they suspect are related to this so uh it it really is a a cause for concern because\nRight now they say it could be a virus could be an environmental toxin\nCould be mosquito borne could be something that has a genetic component to it so they are investigating and in the meantime there are some children who are suffering through this which includes a weakness a muscle weakness and the impossible paralysis in some children\nWhile it's a anything that affects a four year old really of course huge scare for parents\nYeah ... and that's what's really leading to this warning from the CDC they are now saying that uh if you see your child develop a sudden a weakness in the arms and legs or maybe a grouping of the facial features\nOf seek immediate medical care or even though there is no treatment for this at the time being they can start a physical therapy protocols that might be able to minimize some of the effects which range\nOr some children recover rather quickly from this others' experience continued paralysis and require ongoing physical therapy\n\nSo when did this when did this pop up is this relatively new or is this been developing over the last few months\nWell actually it has been on the radar for some years now the first cases were detected back in two thousand twelve the CDC started tracking it in Tony fourteen uh and it's interesting because it seems to focus on late summer and fall that's when it's found\nAnd every two years it seems to spike I mean twenty fourteen\nYet arrives in cases twenty sixteen you had a rise in cases and here we are twenty Eighteen or the right now they say since twenty fourteen they have been documented about four hundred cases like I said it's not\nThe numbers aren't huge but just the fact that it it targets children and can be debilitating is very concerning\nBecause we don't know what is causing it there's no advice on any preventative measures right you're just supposed to you're just supposed to monitor your kids and and see if they show symptoms\nYeah all they can say right now go Henry is that you should treat this like you would treat colds and the flu a first of all get all your vaccinations this is not connected to any type of vaccination\nA number to frequent hand washing and if you're in an area where there are mosquitoes you should have mosquito protection either repellent or a be covered up in those situations because at this point they're not sure whether it is mosquito borne or not\nA bill for any other country dealing with is\nYeah there there it has been reported in some countries in Asia and also in Australia uh so it's not exclusive to the United states and again this is uh something that leads to more of the mystery on it right now they're just really not sure exactly what causes this and\nAnd uh there are a number of theories about it but still they're continuing to work on it and and you know the these cases continue to pop up\nWell All right well uh builds up for a thank you for your time You're welcome\nTheir egos bills or for NBC News radio national correspondent Kelly been just a a what a frightening thing if you're a parent and your kid develops something like this that no one even knows what it is\nIn these cases where the diseases so rare it's not something a doctor would typically look for so I Would imagine it's even harder to diagnose if it does happen\nAnd that wow I Hope they come up with that has some answers soon ... calling us\nOr we're almost at a time in this segment or want to mention that if you want to see what goes on behind the scenes and hear the conversations we have during or commercial breaks and Gulf coasts
