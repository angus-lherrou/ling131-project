L. dot org like I'm On Facebook and Twitter all that and there's actually plays on children's they all died or were you can\nHelp volunteer which I didn't know that you offered the children's of Alabama he told me a little bit about the services that volunteers can potentially took advantage of it\nYeah so I'm On that page we can we have of course are volunteer services we have a great program with tons of volunteers who dedicate many hours um to children's of Alabama come in and help you know do things from\nA a wide variety of things maybe helping 'em cleaned some of the wagons that the patients you know pull around and make sure that those are cleaned in between each ... each patient I'm delivering gifts that may arrive at the front desk to a patient all those sorts of things\nUm and then we have um we have a fence and partners around the state where we use volunteers to help us with things like that\nUh we like to utilize volunteers just to stop in and say hey I I you know I support children's of Alabama thank you guys for\nI'm donating to children's of Alabama miracle trait day they donate the proceeds from blizzards on that day um and so we try to have staff and family than volunteers just stop and and and support those um partners and I'm just let them know that we're here to support them\nCummings own viewpoint Alabama my name is you know would children's of Alabama many ways you can get involved children's AOL dot org and some very cool event you have coming up with children's\nYes so we have I mentioned a miracle trait day um we also have coming up is our um miracle challenge that is a new a nationwide initiative that were really excited about the idea is it's twenty seven days of getting active for one mile a day\nUm the idea that if you're active or if you change your habits for you know Twenty one twenty seven days it will become more of a habit\nUm so you can do any sort of mile a day well crime yoga or whatever and you track that on line and you kind of um a lot of social media it's all on your own time you don't have to go to a class or go to a certain five K. you do it whenever it's convenient for you get your family involved\nUm schools churches everything like that um and then it's a fundraising effort as well because we're asking people to support their family and friends who are doing this for us each day\nUm last year we were chosen as a test market for this and we were really pleased with the participation and the fundraising and we were really excited to do it again this year so we're kind of just kicking off I'm\nGetting folks involved in that and that's something that anyone can do across the state doing their own community and at the time I'm we of course have are a new radios on music in miracles radio bond with with you got and that's always\nA lot of fun we broadcast live here in the hospital we have um families come from across the state they've come and share their story we have staff\nUm live on the air share some of of their perspective from working in the hospital and that's always a really fun two days and we eat a lot a lot of volunteers there to help us with selling T shirts answering the phone and helping us do all the things that make the Radio's on runs vaguely\nAwesome and I do want to sort of culture it's with a whole foods in mountain brokers judge just read that they donate it over forty six hundred dollars to help fund or your CD unit a children's of Alabama\nThey did absolutely they had a really successful um day where they donated proceeds of purchases and um made that that large donation dies and that was just\nFrom you know one day at one of their locations and and we were so glad to have their support and they obviously um did so great everyone loves shopping there um but we were really happy with that with that day as well\nViewpoint Alabama my name is dino on the phone with coming from children's of Alabama a terrific children's hospital that treats kids from not only Birmingham but the state of Alabama and has seen kids from over forty one states\nIn America it's a terrific hospital that loves kids made sure to like I said go to children's Eyal\n... or ... you know we don't Malone during which are you doing financially or being involved many events which is you reward more so when you have them in the state of Alabama service even helping her community's that all the ... or do we coming from children's of Alabama for your thank you so much they know\nYou're listening to viewpoint Alabama a public affairs program from the Alabama radio no we're going to be going on in the early or just look at home and sleep representative told them are girls\nToday we're discussing the upcoming election and some other issues Paul welcome back to ...\nAnd Alabama thank you Jim first little over two weeks to go until election day nationally it's an Epic Battle for control of Congress in Alabama the race for governor tops the ballot follows you survey the political landscape any trends standout [noise] we'll\nNationally uh I think all eyes are on the Senate will the Republican majority stand in the United States Senate\nIf you look at a polling that you solve this past week it looks like the trends have been that well earlier there was some thought that the Democrats would take the Senate back it looks like the Republicans will keep the Senate right now there's a majority fifty one to forty nine but it looks like not only would I keep the Senate\nBut there is some races that make you think they might even actually pick up a couple of states in the Senate\nAnd interesting trends there especially in red states like Texas in Tennessee where you see the Republican candidates gaining the advantage\nYeah uh about a month to six to eight weeks ago those races were actually close based on the polling\nAnd now the Republican candidates in both those races or Ted Cruz the incumbent senator Republican senator in Texas\nAnd Marsha Blackburn congresswoman from Tennessee up for the open seat to replace Senator Bob Corker\n... have taken a significant leads eight to nine to ten points and they look like they are going to based on the polling for what it's worth a have taken significant leads in both those states and so where there was some concern about Republicans they could lose two seats that were Republican seats the Democrats looks like they're going to hold those seats\nIs this a case of Republicans coming home as you get closer to the election\nI think so and you know we can't discount what happened with the the the confirmation hearings for judge Kavanaugh as that's part of the fact because this looks like this is all happening in the past six weeks\nTwo weeks to the election a lot can happen but it looks like as we have gotten closer to the election Republican voters or are expressing where they're going to head and some of the independence that were kind of in the middle have and those two states turning towards Republicans\nIs it your sense that the fight over now justice Brett Kavanaugh got a lot of Republican voters in the game or as perhaps over the summer there was um maybe they were feeling a little more complacent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Uncle Henry Show", "city": "Mobile", "day": "21"}
