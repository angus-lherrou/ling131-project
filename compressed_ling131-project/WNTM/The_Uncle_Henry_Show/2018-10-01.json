{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "So there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talked about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents to think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with a case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOf four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps a another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is and all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people\nFor him that I said if I said OK you set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away or watch the child with the child's gonna do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit\nGet upset cry and then go to sleep and I said how many how many parents and your think your kid would run up hill nobody raised her hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare [noise] but I have all these examples where the heights been achieved by little can't\nOr they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know an incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nOh yeah he's got a movie that we talked about a two year old boy that they just traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges\nAnd he was from face down and know the next morning unbelievably why we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and it has ... couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe it or why\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on the bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours he'd have to go point six miles per hour\nBut kids are going to war for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody pick them up or some something or someone picked him up and blocked him there [noise] [noise]\n... and the reason these cases have significant is that what you report on a child who's abducted in downtown\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know ... put 'em in the car and drove down there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party didn't see anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody else saw anything nobody sonic cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make a difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book uh it's law L.

W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the drag immobile [noise]\nNews headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines when a welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings Michael by our NBC News radio national correspondent Michael Bauer good morning\nOr good morning to you or Glenn are you happy Monday and happy October first\nHappy October first to you to show is anybody going to be satisfied with this week long FBI investigation\nOh go ahead or it's D.C who satisfied with anything nobody ever satisfied with anything and everybody has to point fingers at everybody else except themselves I think that's where we sit here today we're\nAs of friday we know that the Senate Judiciary committee agreed to conduct in the FBI investigation or are they continued conducting the SBA FBI investigation the background of Brett Kavanaugh which is technically what this is\nThe president signed off on it so he's saying the president is that he's given the FBI free rein in this world but Saturday the New York times reported that the White House has asked the FBI to only question\nFor witnesses and that would certainly seem as though that the limitation on the type of FBI probe that can be happening here so then\nSunday you head a Dianne Feinstein wrote a letter to the White House demanding that they provide to the Senate Judiciary committee a copy of the written directive to the FBI to which the White House responded we haven't done anything all of the directives have come from\nYou guys in the Senate so we're standing here today not knowing anything more but that both parties seemingly on some level unhappy with the scope of this investigation that is now under way\nSo I don't know if this is all about justice for Dr Ford or for Brett Kavanaugh on his family it does seem like it's it's about making this last longer so I Would\nCertainly say I would certainly say that that's definitely spot oh that is a very good point I mean you have not only a former FBI cheap James Comey who nobody wants to hear from but he's the former FBI Director has come out and said that there would be a lot of information that the FBI could find out about cabinet in a week's period of time\nBut he said that he doesn't believe this is about getting the truth out there because of the truth we're the only goal there'd be no time clock and the investigation wouldn't have been\nBrought to the table after the Senate Judiciary committee endorsed the nominee said that he thinks that this is about the Republican goal saying that there was an investigation and it didn't change their view of the Democratic goal saying that there was an investigation and they found incriminating evidence to the rail the nominee and that seems to be what this was all\nAbout well so I see\nA couple of things that could happen and maybe you can come up with a few more but I think that uh they made in the investigation at the seven day mark and have a vote one way or the other and accept the results whether he goes through or not\nOr or new accusations pop up around Thursday mhm and ... and and then it becomes an open ended and the FBI investigation or they withdraw the name\nYeah I I think I think any and all of those are possible like for instance we know that in the past twenty four hours is a former\nClassmate of Brett Kavanaugh's that's come out uh who is now an assistant professor at North Carolina who says that are not only did Kevin I'll drink he was a frequent drinker he was a heavy drinker and when he did drink he would get aggressive and belligerent and that\nNow professor former classmate is done\nI swore written statement that he's taking to the FBI so technically this will be put if you follow procedure into Brett Kavanaugh's background file\nWhich is what the FBI is continuing to investigate here now does that get\nAny further questioning are they going to sit down with this former classmate tried to get some information hard to tell at this point but it does seem like\nYou know we know for instance cabinet and Dr Ford neither one of them have been talked to by the FBI yet maybe it's because they have a a ton of testimony out there that the FBI would just used for the most part maybe come back with a couple of questions we know Deborah Ramirez the second accuser who claimed that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her\nShe's been talked to by the FBI but\nJulie sweating it who was the third woman to come forward and has not had any conversations with the FBI whatsoever so I think you're right I think there is a very good chance let's get the friday password to fight it let's say the seven days is up there is a very good chance you're going to see a lot of screaming and yelling and fighting about what\nDepth this investigation went to what they were able to find and you could still very well see vote move forward maybe this time next week on the seating of Brett Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court justice\nSo I'm Kim we agree that the next ... if it's there is a next nominee er during the Trump Administration can we agreed that it'll be a woman\n[noise] it would seem as though that would be the next play right I mean that would seem as though that's the direction to go and I would think here\nAre based upon the the me too movement that's not a bad political move to go in and certainly I mean I think at the end of the day the big question that most people had over the weekend or certainly a big number of people had over the weekend is is Brett Kavanaugh the best selection is he the best opportunity\nFor Supreme Court justice that anybody could bring to the table or is it worth investigating\nOther possibilities maybe there's somebody who would not have these kinds of a background concerns are issues and and perhaps\nIf you're looking at a female nominee I mean listen there's going to be scrutiny and I think that that scrutiny is going to be certainly cranked up to ten or eleven and no matter who is going to be uncle Henry but perhaps if you can fit somebody who doesn't have\nConcerns in the background as much or if you've got any kind of a FBI investigation that sets up the back row profile that would be the direction to go\nI guess we're looking for a nun with judicial experience\n[laughter] that's a big that would be the case yeah that would be the finite let's give it a thumbs up to everybody and\nBe able to pass on I think that's what they do look\nMichael ... thank you for your time today you got to have a great rest of your morning I'll go ahead right\nThere goes Michael by

I remember one of the first places I went when I moved here Thirty years ago was to Oakland and you get a really good idea of how\nLife was back in those days at that museum it's a it's remarkable place and if you have a visit it's worth the drive from Mississippi over here but you got to do it soon because now\nI Can't believe I'm saying this it looks like the city is saying they're going to have to close\nAnd uh hopefully it will be sold I I I just can't even imagine number one that this was happening that that we would actually close one\nOf our big tourist attractions and part of the soul of the city because of a funding issues the mayor saying that uh if they can't come up with more donations and the city is going to close it because it needs to work [noise]\nUh I I what do you think about this uncle\nHenry well I it's it's yeah it's um [noise] it's it would be a terrible thing to lose ... in the ... neighborhood no doubt about it it reminds me of when the mayor it was about\nOr three months ago the mayor let it be known that there was an enormous amount of deferred maintenance on city owned properties all throughout\nThe city immobile many many millions of dollars worth of deferred maintenance and I don't know how much of that applies to Oakland you but it's another situation all of us that are homeowners can\nCan understand how it it must cost a lot of money just to keep something that old in good condition\nUm I Am surprised door when that that that there hasn't been a bigger effort to try and and just at least Maine\nThe property\nYeah I I ... I Am feeling that way too and and here's another reason a lot of people donate money\nTo keep that place going if it's not enough at least they're helping there was a historic preservation society for mobility actually keeps she tried to raise money for this and they're doing it now they're trying to raise even more might keep it open so uh you know the city's not alone on this\nUh but you know if you're just going to go willy nilly closing or or or uh selling off and they've talked about selling off some of these properties that they don't feel like they can invest in a there's something wrong with that I'm Sorry but this is this is ... that's a little bit too far for me to take because\nA ... is a big part of the city's history and and tourists come by the busload to see it\nUh and just sometimes sometimes these things don't make money\nThey but they are part of the image of the city and they're part of the attraction of the city so yeah I certainly uh certainly hope that they can raise more money they're asking for a hundred and fifty donations five hundred dollars each to keep this going and I hope they can find those hundred and fifty people but I also think it will be derelict to the city of dirty my opinion\nOnly if if they close ugly um I I just don't know what things but I Wonder what the mayor's even thinking\nOr or or if it was even on his radar when he's got all these other\nUm I'm I'm going to think that the amount of money and hoped that the amount of money to restore oh clearly is far less than some of the other big\nA deferred maintenance problems like for example led stadium immobile yes you have to take care of the problems locally uh for a fraction of the amount of money it would take to help bland\nAnd don't even get started about Gulf Coast a quest bud right but here's the I ...
