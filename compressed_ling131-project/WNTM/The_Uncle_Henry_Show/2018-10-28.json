{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "And I think I I think with Sandra Tsing she's off the phone is I think she's trying to somehow rationalize away the fact that she got totally bamboozled\nAnd was in ... ah versus I was hypnotized and I have no control ... yeah I don't think so\nHigh mark\nYes I entered into a a settlement contract with a large insurance company and they were supposed to uh give me a two good faith check up front\nFor a total of a two hundred and one thousand dollars in payments for the next seven years I took the checks down to the bank and a crater new account specifically for those are the one check for forty five thousand dollars one through\nAnd then it was notified by the bank and a set in the mail a return on a stop payment on the second check\nOkay did you did you call them up and just ask why\nI asked why and everybody is walking around with their head gone G we've never heard of this ever happening before\nOr you may have to hire a well I wouldn't even hire a lawyer yet\nA now comes a a letter saying you're clearly in breach of the contract\nAnd send them a letter out senator and breach of a\n... new\n... center to all the different\n... and ... how long ago how long ago did you send that letter how many weeks ago or\nDays or weeks ago All right well John couple of weeks ago is not enough time for all that they've had sixty days to respond I Know but they do and I just have a more and I just had\nOne of those where it was a settlement huh that no we entered into my company entered into where we were going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job who had insurance so we settled at\nAnd they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company correct they ended up paying within Seventy five days is how long it took us to get paid\nOkay and to the point where our lawyer had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement had to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we actually had to file a lawsuit\nFor breach before they paid okay so mark just get really aggressive\nOr if they ... you probably fell through the cracks market uh if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid more there's no question and then I Would turn around and see how much interest you're paying ... small claims court for the interest you lost through\nOK well you'll get paid more guy it's ... it that's world of insurance they're they grab you you're you're a second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance ear canceled\nSeventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark and that's typically what the payment to the timeline normally is\nGo figure huh oh hey Gary welcome to handle on the law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine ... nine home uh we when we bought a house um where was given a or excuse me a faint fan are that are\nLimited what we could do a lot of what we can do with our own\nAnd one of the stipulations of the the the at are fed that each of the homes have do we build on a single a lot and um that each home had to be at least Seventy five feet wide there are other stipulation but\nWhat happened was a developer got to the city of Ventura or the city approve the splitting of the lot and now the developer is building to homes that are in violation of the CBC in are in a number of different ways\nOkay so I wanted to know what our record\nThe record on now you are you what you do is you get the homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against them just because of the city allows a certain type of building a the ah the community that is the H away also can control\nAnd they can say no one more than one lie or one home for a lot now I then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back and saying you're violating liability\nOr to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winner here in my opinion would be the H away but you you it's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney\nOr it is a real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use and there are a attorneys out there and then in fact represent nothing but H always\nOkay\nSo you get to go just go on the uh go on the Internet and check them out because that is I Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's no way in hell was especially if you're building additional homes that's\nBig money for them All right max\nHi good morning coffee ... inch quiet my horse [laughter] okay so yes you have trouble with an insurance company yeah sure never heard that one before ever max and much of that yeah it was\nWas a while now asking [laughter] anyway ah anyway they shorted me based on the estimate of up space for a minute they shorted may eight hundred seven dollars [laughter] yeah and I call them a couple of times the size and they told me to go pound it\nSaid that is anyway ah anyway what I did I filed in small claims court trade are there in Ninety seven\nBut you know the charred hundred version on the trucks to check that negates credit for going right now I'm Wondering if I drink a check because I Know it ... ... ... yeah\nYeah because that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you would sound is jak then I Will not go after you I have all my rights absolutely so the only way you can go and check their bodies to say no thank you to the track and go ahead and fire when small claims court and kick their what\nOkay that's where I'm going\nTo go look and here's the good news whenever you go in front of a judge small claims judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works normally they would take it right up to superior court\nAnd so you're really not going to be in front of the uh a judge or where we small claims judge which are usually not judge was ... and that is a and this happens all the time would be companies they immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly\nHowever there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nSo you're coming in with an advantage\nBy dry cleaners never even go to small claims court ever because they know they're gonna lose walking in the door they just write checks now the good news is they write checks for the amount of replacing a\nDress and I've had\nA pair of pants they know I shop at Costco so it wasn't even more cash the check [noise] this is handling [laughter]\n\nThis is Michael Medvedev here with Mike stole from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage the news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe government project across the Medicare

to age ... and drop off\nAnd do we're an action all week and we're glad to have anybody that wants to apply a if you don't have the Medicaid waiver the the ...\n[laughter] look you know what you are I Would have to say as far as like contemporary art is for me the absolute most well known hugely successful actor from Alabama has to say that\nRight now well I appreciate that considered every time you know I I was behind Ruben started for so long [laughter] you know why should I cannot unfortunately it's the kind of make that stuff\nI think first of all thank you so much like we're on I guess sixty seven radio station here so you're talking to the entire state of Alabama and will do here which is the greatest thing in the world even though you moved to Los Angeles I think you set off or fortune and fame like in the nineties was that\nNinety six right after high school I went out yeah did you still live here no no no once I made the jump\nYou know it was a kind of with both feet so I was there until two thousand and ten and just kind of beating the pavement in figuring things out and then once we started having children my wife and I we kind of want to do I I Want to you know she's from Houston but I wanted to give my children kind of that same upbringing that I had so loaded up to ...\nAnd you're from clay clay you graduated from which high school you trust the bill and you have three kids now and live on a farm that is correct that is correct I live on a farm do you really I have horses I was attracted big horse for that do you have horses I Do have horses or what kind of horse if you have to quarter and a a Walker\nOh you did their big hair walkers are really big in Alabama this is something I wasn't ready for like when I moved here I had an apple lose a thoroughbred and paint and everybody's like yeah let's go for twenty five mile ride I have a walking or ... what do you have\nA broken back [laughter] it's like you're very Alabama when it comes to your choice of horses [laughter] okay so I'm just going to jump right on and I am so upset that\nYou're no longer on lethal weapon you were my favorite on the show in fact as far as I'm concerned Damon Wayans plays the ... role to me he could have been switched out with about Fifteen or twenty other actors and we never would have known that difference\nBecause his wife is way better in her role trash\nHe ever was he's kind of like white bread or something like a blend in with the what do you call it the wallpaper okay so Damon Wayans is still on the show and the biggest [laughter]\nIs Martin rags the guys playing the Martin rage character they killed off okay\nHow does that make any sense to me I'm a little upset about it as you can tell my favorite show and it's no longer I Can't even watch it anymore it's been ruined for me\nYou know book it's it's sad and I and I feel for the fans because I think so many people enjoyed the show and and and you know the the outpour on social media has been so beautiful you know because I was told every day that I could be replaced with any of the white guy\nJoins he is saying it it it it is you\nKnow but it I think it's all perception and and those guys certainly see day in\nA way to just wait a minute it's not perception\nAnd if it is so called perception someone needs to get a clue they've spent too long in Hollywood I Know that I can speak for legions of fans when I say\nThat at the beginning of this we may have been a not so sure that we wanted to embrace it because you were messing with lethal weapon and Mel Gibson and it's just a classic however once\nWe started watching the show we fell in love with you and Martin rags and we were invested in you in every single week we wanted to see your life turned around and good stuff come your way and then all of the sudden you don't have a good thing come your way you end up getting shot\nBy your half brother and if that's not enough then they killed yeah they killed Martin bricks from lethal weapon the perception is they screwed up\nThat's the perception out here in real America they fired\nThe wrong guy period there is no other way you can look at this and I am venting to you and I can't believe that I get this opportunity to do so because there are so many fans who would love to tell you the same thing you were the show you are the show and without you they might as well just pull the plug\nYou know for us in my family and and and I and I and I agree you know look again I think that I I've prided our show on being a something that and there's not a lot a lot out there these days where everyone mom dad and the children can all sit around together and yes I'm In or men and women I think it brought a lot of couples together that don't really have a lot in common them and what there was no\nAbsolutely everybody it was something for everybody\nTo get it I mean and we we we strive for that you know um\n[noise] you know from my family it it certainly been sad into kind of get catapulted out of the situation but for us you know we were pulled into it I certainly didn't fight for this job I felt the same way you did I felt what are those guys are done in the eighties\nOr in the early nineties shouldn't be messed with\nYou know I I think shame black wrote arguably one of the greatest scripts and yeah I mean certainly created one of the greatest relationship buddy cop shows absolutely had ever seen right so I certainly didn't want to mess with that and and I also had no desire to work within the network world which I kind of feel like it's a little bit of sausage factory in the sense that we're just kind of puffing up product\nAnd that's not my style of entertainment by any means so\nThat just didn't seem like that at all this will light broke my\nBack trying to make it were that right because I again I Lived in this huge show and I certainly didn't want to just to be my last project so again I I was reluctant to go in because I didn't want to mess it up and ah and I've just been working for years on rectify so it was looking all sort of take a little bit of a brick yeah time with my family and this kind of slid\nIn this wasn't going to do it\nFor years when I left the house they were going to continue that I was able to take care of their college but outside of it you know tight with them\n[laughter] but um you know so again what we've learned\nIs that been and I don't want to get into what we all believe in but we know that there's something out there that's kind of in control or at least you know can help manipulate the situation you know whether she got her energy the universe whatever you want to give 'em in for me to be pulled into this situation\nAnd it allowed us an opportunity to start a foundation\nAnd it allowed me to play a character that I just absolutely love for years and I kind of felt like in a way for forty episodes 'cause we shut Eighteen to twenty two I felt like I had a ... I felt secure ... are granted no one wants to see Barton rage get killed but I felt as an artist that I had a nice arc so for us\nTo be catapulted into a situation and then it'd be catapulted out\nWas perfect timing her and I never had any control over it never not anything to him between well let me think that you had a love interest alright who kind of came in and out your dad came back\nAh he was in prison he tried to kill you played by the amazing Richland he was really a few really good and those scenes\nThe powerful between you guys let's say you almost got killed I don't know how many times on the show just in the normal investigation process of what you were doing and then as you started before the scene and the graveyard where you're half\nBrother a shot and killed you and I really never thought she would die I thought of course he'd come back before you got there it just me or does it seem like your time on screen in crazed ... financially between\nIt seemed like you were never not on the screen\nAnd it felt like I was never nodded Warner Brothers [noise] you know it was it certainly um the workload was put on me but I was excited about that because I'm a little bit of a control freak and it allowed me to\nYou know run quality control in a sense for what we were trying to tell and I I you know when you have Thirteen riders fourteen writers in a room\nAnd you have a new director every single week it's difficult to maintain that singular vision through well sure and we didn't have a show runner on set you know ah what is a runner be run the show\nOh [laughter] that was so many ... life took information and ran it back to the studio\nUm that kind of would be more of a that would be a proper or a description of what our show runner did right he he he was just not there um and and and and so again I was there to kind of again it was it was more the kind of keep the train on the tracks\nAnd have that singular boys are from week to week which again can kind of get lost of network because everyone working insane hours yeah you just you're so exhausted\nPhoning it in his really sometimes the only option but unfortunately for me I don't know how to do that right I Would love to I could have made a lot more money and you know I could have probably not been in so stressed out throughout the ...\nTo me that wasn't what it seemed like from the START I mean to me it really seemed like it was his own little film its own little blockbuster movie every week so I\nWould have maybe kind of lost interest if that's the way it continued bank like it was so great for what it was I was like man you might not pull on films every week you know how", "show_name": "The Uncle Henry Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Mobile", "day": "28"}
