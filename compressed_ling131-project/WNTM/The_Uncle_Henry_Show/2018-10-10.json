ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they'd show videotapes of various anchor people and ... the one that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired or they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter or with the people in the audience they never got hired\nI I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's\nThe type of technology that is being used in present meant experiments measuring

the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world\nWhat I've found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind that matter\nThe classic study used this random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have if you present their oath in fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is asked people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room so they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more one heroes\nAgain what do we find is that there's a mall but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible response is during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen what they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in people do people have that ability or yeah\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nOr set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is look at the behavior of the machines around the world around event that we know\nAre produced heightened emotions and nine eleven as one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant trait basically at a at a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike\nAt nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike\nHappened before the plane hit the\nTowers before the event that\nBefore the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nFor a yellow her you know that name of course an

looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator where it's actually\nBending metal for example and early ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who sat in two thousand Fifteen

of ... success in this experimental\nPeriod we consider that he has demonstrated paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo you know there has been a lot of debate about

I think goes all the way back to Reagan a show so yeah there's [laughter]\nYeah [laughter]\nAnd well the answer to that question actually is Samantha Power who was are you on a basket or for forty years but nobody remembers that Brian remembers Susan Rice who serve\nFor four years under Brock Obama a and you might think John Bolton served for a year who is no national security advisor ah and if you go way back you're talking about people like John Negroponte and bill Richard Senate Madeleine Albright uh well I'm just trying to find when ... who did you say who did you mention\nKirkpatrick oh Jeane Kirkpatrick was [laughter] long ago was that [laughter] Nineteen eighty one to eighty five\nYes yeah oh hey Reagan Reagan guy I'm we're in Iran brownie points for history today uncle Henry for sure and I'm wearing a Reagan button\nYeah so it but you're you're right a Nikki Haley kind of elevated this position to a new level or she was a tremendous representative of the United states with the UN that\nPlus a she really delivered the Trump policy in the U.S policy to the rest of the world and maybe more than ... than anybody else ever did at the un\nRight will bills for we're at a time thank you for your time today\nThank you very much and I don't know what I have another chance to talk about Jeane Kirkpatrick so thank you\nVery much [laughter] very welcome that'll probably be my last time two [noise] or\nWe can see 'em Googling that name later that's what's coming you know we are we're at a time\nFor this hour now coming up we've got all the news headlines for yet of course came Michael will be covered in those headlines we'll get back into it next hour\nIf you want any other information you can go to our Web sites news talk one oh four nine dot com or news radio some ten dot com or any of the heart radio station Web sites in are the key word storm watch and you can get all the info there [noise]\n\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute chairs of tears are down thirty one percent in pre market trading the wall Street Journal reports that the company has hired him three partners to prepare a bankruptcy filing\nIt could come as soon as this week stopped teachers are slipping and ... is down a bit this morning as well as the futures down three point and that teachers Downey team Dow futures Downey team makes ... lower by five cents at Seventy four dollars and Ninety One sense a barrel\nInvestors continue to track hurricane Michael national Highway Traffic Safety Administration is taking exception to Tesla's characterization of the agencies safety ratings\nAt Tesla blonde said the company engineered the model three to quote be the safest car ever built new guidelines warn that using terms such as the safest or perfect to describe a particular rating or an overall score are misleading ...
