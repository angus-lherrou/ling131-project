talking about a lottery for Alabama acting like it's a possibility and I just want to caution you those that think that Alabama is going to get a lottery in the next few years just be cautious trying to ... just trying to manage your expectations realistically\nI Would compare it to the alcohol situation in Alabama when I think we were the last state that allowed home brewing\nWe were also one of the last states do allow people to buy beer that was larger than twelve ounces\nAnd I remember the legislate tours were saying for several years that they ... they didn't want you to be able to buy a sixteen ounce beer because they didn't think he could handle it\n\nThat the size of the container who'd cause problems now logically it's hard to understand because you could always buy food twelve ounce beers and have even more than sixteen ounces but they felt like\nFor some reason the sixteen ounce beer could cause\nJust a ... a calamity in this day and they fought it for you and finally I don't know what happened but they finally allowed the sixteen ounce beers in the convenience stores\n\nAnd I know it didn't make any sense 'cause you could buy a keg or you could buy twelve ounce beer or you could buy a case of twelve ounce beer but for some reason the sixteen ounce beer was seen as a threat\n\nSo that's the mind that that's the mindset [noise] that deals with all of our issues in

Fifteen minutes right now Kelly Bennett you remember I've been telling you for a few weeks about the dispute going on\nIn ... about the people that work in the public works department to pick up trash\nAnd how they ... they they have complaints about their pay they also have complaints about a supervisor that they claim is mistreating them on the job and we had a day a few weeks ago where they had a sick out\nWhere a lot of them called in sick on a city council bay and then once the ones that showed up\nThen when I left work and we're considered African without leave and many of them went to the city council meeting to complain about their jobs and so twenty nine of them were put on administrative leave\nWhere we have an update on that story late yesterday afternoon the mayor's office in mobile issued a statement from the mayor\nWhere he said that they recently conducted creed disciplinary hearings with twenty six of the employees and its sixteen were reinstated but ten of the employees work terminated\nWow\nExcuse me so they are he the mayor went on to say they're actively hiring and encourage interested applicants to keep a lookout for open positions on the personnel board websites so this so this dispute continues with now ten employees terminated they're not giving any real individual reasons for this okay I'm\nIn the city council\nThey have said that they want to initiate their own investigation and they're using their council attorney to find out the legalities of whether or not they can do that so this this remains an on going\nLabor dispute between the people to pick up trash in the city and now it's resulted in ten people losing their jobs\nOK so a couple of questions on this\nThey fired people now are it is the supervisor that people have complained about among those that were fired or do you now\nDoes it ... the state but does not mention names of people or or any of that so we don't yet know anything like that and I don't know if we'll know ...\nI guess the other question right would be are they taking the trash up and then all of this dispute they are is it delayed or\nWhether they're saying that they um they have been off schedule their schedule is not normal or now garbage pickup has not been affected a trash pickup\nHas been a and they're ... they said that they're still working hard to try and get everything back on a normal schedule they've been calling in some retired employees and\nOther other employees from other departments to fill in to try and maintain the public services but [noise] if you've had a

N. T.

situation\nThe more ah caravans right now are Michael Bell or not yet joining us but we do have some info for you on that issue on that story\nYeah President Trump defending suggestions that the migrant caravan contain some suspected terrorists from the Mid East smart Mayfield has that report\nAt the White House on Tuesday he said he had some very good information but when he was pressed for details you seemed less sure\nThere's no proof of anything there's no proof of anything but they could very well be vice\nPresident my parents said the president of Honduras told him this was organized by a leftist groups in Honduras and financed by Venezuela the caravan of several thousand migrants continues a slow walk through Mexico headed to the U.S border President Trump said\nThey're not coming in you said he will deploy the military if he needs to mark Mayfield NBC News radio\nOkay so so we're hearing that um what we just heard was that Honduras is claiming that Venezuela is paying for this or was was a budding some money for this\nYes and you know there was a situation where I was hearing there was more than one caravan now\nAnd so how many people there were seven thousand and the first one and it was said to be growing ... the last time we talked about it and I think you know the concern is secure the border it's very possible that some people with some very bad intentions\nHave worked their way into these caravans and they want to do harm to the United states\nWell and ... yes I'm there there's really no way to know who might be in the Caribbean one way or the other uh also um I've heard some reports that said that that\nWe used to see just single males trying to make their way in and that has changed in the last year where you see lots of young men accompanied by a young women\nAnd they're all these claims that ... that it may be a part of human trafficking or it may be a scheme or as an easier way to get in if you if you bring a youngster with you to get across the border um but it's hard to sort through all this right I mean 'cause uh\nThere's it's difficult to know from where we are who all the people might be in the Caribbean\nWell and not only that but I think if you interview them all individually you still necessarily wouldn't be able to pull bad guys from the good guys or because they've got their stories to tell right right so security wise it's got to be a nightmare to think about all these people\nAnd it it's just a a situation that it looks like it continues to get 'em\nBigger you know it's a bigger situation for folks that try to handle as we are talking I was trying to look and see if I see something new on this story that I could share with everybody but I'm really not I'm just\n[noise] [noise] well and Michael Belmont yes ...\nYou just you want to open your arms and help people out that her in a bad situation you have a lot of compassion for people and they really want to come to this country for\nThe right reasons but there's there's a way to do it and there are people that are making their way here legally and you don't you know there's there's a line forming I think there's a process\nRight or as you pointed out work country that a lot of us especially in modern times uh ... like the story of the immigrants that come here legally and and um is here to work for a better life it's it's something that a lot of us are descended from\n... but\nThe ... this looks more like chaos\nRight and ... something that that we we've got to be careful with no doubt it's certainly a mess it looks like it's going to be an even bigger one is we go forward\nA and it looks like no we will have no update today from Michael Bauer it looks like okay we've not heard from him on the story but we'll keep you up

dispute\nBetween the the city of mobile and the public works department if you've been following the story you you're aware that for\nFor a while now we've had complaints from public works employees about their pay we even had some people from out of town\nLike I think a community organizers from Birmingham showed up at some city council meetings or maybe a month or two ago trying to speak out on behalf\nOf the public works workers in ... um and then we had complaints recently about a specific supervisor in the public works department allegedly treating the workers wrong and they had signed a big petition to try and get a get rid of that that supervisor\nWill this lead to a couple of weeks ago a lot of of the public works employees called in sick\nSo they so they could go to a city council meeting other workers showed up at work and then left work and we're considered an absolute without leave\nWell as a result of all that the call to get sick and leaving the job twenty nine of those workers were put on administrative leave the mayor's office released a statement from the mayor late yesterday\n\nAnd when I say late yesterday it was about as close to four thirty in the afternoon the mayor released a statement saying that they recently conducted pre disciplinary hearings with twenty six of those employees and public\nWorks they were able to reinstate sixteen of the employees but ten of them were terminated\nSo the mayor announced yesterday that ten of those public works employees were terminated the mayor went on to say that they were actively hiring and encourage interested applicants to keep a lookout for open positions on the personnel board website\nNow here's a direct quote from the mayor statement quote to ensure our citizens student\nThat experience gaps
