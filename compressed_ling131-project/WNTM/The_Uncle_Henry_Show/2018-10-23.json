O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much Clinton fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north of\nMel oceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um [noise] but yes the waters\nOn Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow\nThanks and and sees would start to fill up and that also be rain and once you have that kind of planet with a thick sealed to atmosphere liquid water rain and then you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis uh it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen from Mars to breed them all\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient and in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um\nSo I think Mars is going to be terrified and within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about and who's going to do with the Robert what country but\nThe Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves\nNo when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watches to ...

B. in Biloxi\nInto a news radio some tangible un team and Ninety nine find them to drag immobile we have news headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get there we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings Michael ... bc news radio national correspondent Michael good morning\nGood morning or good morning Kelly happy to say to you both\nSo so what has happened since we last talked to you yesterday about this ... this because there's something every day on this this is only a journalist story\nI Do feel like there is also part of that where you sounded like it was a soap opera start what since we last left you yeah um\nYeah yeah I mean we we are literally the place where there were some announcements yesterday by Turkish politician that can show he's body was found in a well\nNear the Saudi constantly ... and then we were going to hear today president or the one in front of parliament there in Turkey describe the naked truth what happened in great detail in regards to the death of ...\nOnly we didn't get that from or to want to date we didn't get that he just really added new rhetoric to this cattle he did accuse the Saudi Government a premeditated political murder\nBut did you offer any evidence to that or anything else in regards to the death of the show he no he offered a timeline that was one little bit of a piece of the story that I hadn't heard before that I thought was interesting which is where he said the\nUh the Fifteen member group that flew over from Saudi Arabia that a\n... killed because Yogi according to what the Turkish officials are found a portion of that group on October second went in removed the hard disks of the security cameras from within the consulate but aside from that there was no other evidence was and again that wasn't evidence offered up that's just a statement by president Earl on so we didn't really hear anything except\nFor sort of threats and his call on Saudi Arabia to if they can indeed arrest these Fifteen people ah who committed the murder and his temple that they would be tried it is that bill on some level aside from that\nThere was no facts that we're still audiotape there was no DNA evidence and there are certainly wasn't a production of here is the bones saw that was used to this member of the body of ...\nSo what is what is the official story as of today from Saudi Arabia now are they claiming that they're looking into it too or or ...\nYeah they they say that they are investigating there's an ongoing investigation as well last we heard from Saudi Arabia they admitted that there was a murder of ... inside the consulate that it was a it for their\nView that it was a fight that had gone wrong at a fistfight had killed ... but from there all they could tell us was that the fistfight killed him and then the people inside the conflict who actually did the killing went rogue on some level and apparently the Saudis are looking for those individuals as suspects in the murder of ... they\nApparently got the information that it was a fist fight and then no idea where the body is aren't able to track down the people that were in the room there\nEven though on more than one occasion according to Turkish investigators they have identified a few of the people that were in that room a there was even a report in the past twenty four hours that there was a broadcast from with inside of the ... to the consulate from one of print Solomon's close aides\nOr south al ... who is apparently somebody who's close with the\nCrown prince and also via Skype threatened\nA ... right there in the consulate so they had a broadcast of his phone call via Skype or where he was threatening to show yet at one point in time told the henchmen there were in that room to bring me the head of the dog um so now again\nNone of that offered via proof if that was all on audiotape or where they were getting that information Turkish officials none of that was offered up to parliament nor to the world today when he spoke to parliament president or to on a and it's this thing that he has all this information that we do know that the uh our CIA director has gone overseas for the FBI Gina Haspel is there\nA we were told that she was going to monitor the situation I'm guessing she's trying to get in there and get as much in an information she can from the investigation to bring back to President Trump\nSo we're we're still are artificial line is that we're still looking into it I guess is that if we're\nStill way I guess technically I mean it's not our investigation so we're literally waiting on the two parties involved here were waiting on turkey to complete their investigation which let's be fair they have not located a body yet and that that was a call made by\nA president or two on today as well asking for Saudi Arabia to let them know who within the confines of turkey was responsible for helping them get rid of the body and the Saudi officials who are saying that they're still try to track down these people that went rogue\nAnd that a one off the grid if you will and killing show gay and they're trying to track those people down the suspect so until that's kind of wrapped up we're just at the behest of their investigations and getting as much information as we can\nMichael power um and I don't know if you can answer this question or not but I'm I don't know a lot about turkey and Saudi Arabia and their relationship um should we completely trust turkey and all of this uh or or do they have an end chicken antagonistic relationship with Saudi Arabia\nThey there there is very much antagonism even to this point let me just highlighted by saying this that that um or to want to having his announcement today in front of parliament was happening at the exact same time that the crown prince was opening his financial seminar or can a conference there in Saudi Arabia he was\nDoing it purposefully to draw attention away from Saudi Arabia\nAnd the crown prince and his big conference of all of these big business people that were going to be in Saudi Arabia that the U.S backed up and I believe that fifty other countries are so backed off of a he did it at the exact same time to draw attention away from that and towards himself so\nUh this is not a great relationship between the two I don't think turkey wants to go out of their way to create a bad relationship and sort of falsifying this information but\nI Do think that there is a sort of a combative element between the two U.S especially when you've got this new reign of the crown prince trying to be by I guess less less Muslim friendly more Arab friendly and you've got the the Muslim world of the Turks are trying to stand their ground\nMichael by we're out of time thank you for your
