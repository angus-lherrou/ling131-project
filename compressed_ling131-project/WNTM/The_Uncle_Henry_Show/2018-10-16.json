minutes right now though a kill a bit of a new casino in the works\nYeah this is a possibility in Long Beach and there's been kind of talk in town about this since mayor George bashed took office 'cause everybody knew\nHe supported a casino but the gaming commission is actually going to be in Long Beach November fifteenth are going to hold a hearing at city hall where they will consider site

M. yesterday was the day that Elizabeth Warren\nCame out with her DNA test results that this um this\nStory kind of caught me off guard no of course I've heard all of this stuff about Elizabeth Warren\nNow for several years about\nA lot of people very skeptical of with Elizabeth Warren when she came out with the results of a DNA test now in my opinion\nAnd probably a lot of people's opinion the reason that she's come out with his DNA tests just because she wants to run for president I think she saw\nThe uproar with hash tag me to involving the Brett Kavanaugh thing\nAnd I think of ... 'cause we started hearing from er a lot right is that was going on and I think she saw that energy of women versus men in power and I think that really\nTo her looked like an attractive thing to try and ride into\nThe White House and so Elizabeth Warren wants to run for president in my opinion\nAnd that's what this DNA test was about yesterday so she came out with this test that showed that she had what one one thousand\nSomething this ... this tiny percentage of of NATO Native American ancestry and the reaction was probably very different from what she thought\nI I Am I noticed yesterday lots of people jumping all over her all over the Internet way more than I thought would really\nJust attacking her for this task mocking the results mocking the fact that it was such a tiny tiny percentage ... it was just I it almost was like a back firing thing yesterday or at least from my perspective it looked like it backfired owner\n\nBut of course a President Trump or\nHe was asked if he was going to apologize to her and give the million he had said he'd give a million dollars to\nCharity if it turned out she was Native American\n... shows the country that apology why what's their percentage one one thousand I don't have the exact number when you have the percentage Shelley what what about it and I call her and you would I mean if she gets the nomination\nWhere I was going to have a holiday like test her personally [noise]\nOkay that will not be something I enjoy doing either\n[laughter] [noise] okay the president making me laugh\n[noise] um [noise]\nThe most interesting thing about this is the reaction of the Cherokee Nation they they're not happy with this they don't they don't like it when anybody uses a DNA test like this to to lay claim to connection to Native Americans and they've asked her to stop\n[noise] time saver traffic [noise]\nOr we have a new accident in Pensacola this is on the east nine mile road and Kim strand road are you do have some road walk in there so you might want to avoid the intersection meantime immobile so working snow rotor Tana Williams Moffett road every I sixty five interchange no big baby weight", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Uncle Henry Show", "city": "Mobile", "day": "16"}
