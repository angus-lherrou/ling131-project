I wanted to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third of any year so those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is\nFocus on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure that\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it\nMight be well one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there they're amazed because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information\nAnd so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports a need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they are being reported like Lincoln split hour after hour and I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like\nThis whole thing about social networking we're you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there and so\nIt's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere and I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me are back in July and you're always popping out on New Year's day with us right can you chat to chart the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one\nAnd you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you could take a look at the whole month of November by looking at the same midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment no the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nWell yeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always rising and the son is in Capricorn at the bottom of the charge because it's midnight and so\nThere you have to feed and all the other plants like for instance midnight New Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional planet of war will go into its own sign actually laid on December thirty one and then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but suddenly Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations a lot of blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\nWhy does it work more why does astrology war\nBecause here's what's happening\nIsn't that the planets are throwing down right this is what the old idea exactly what and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words if\nEverything depends on something being born in a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the village of course they'll tide of twin that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that three they're taking in the first ... like the declaration of independence is usually use for the Americans chart because it was a first\nBreath were were thing gets wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon and the various planet it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time\nUh that that happened you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what is that saying about the potential of my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website the new one great to bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in a moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month they in near earth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate yeah are you\nWell\nLook I could if somebody said to me I Know when I'm bored ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month in here I could do anything for that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things sunrise birth is is it near noon is a ton said is it\nA midnight we're ordered the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most of the planet are going to be in the ... they're going to be in the same lines but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go half of the time\nAnd so the moon has a lot to do with our instincts or mood even reincarnation and looking back who you may have been the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has what to do with personality\nThe sun is more of the character and kind of a life force\nAnd a connection a little bit more just spirituality but so polarizing and which is sunrise in the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nIn and tell me this march since you've been doing this way about thirty seconds before the brunt of your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver yeah isn't this field well unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay because I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't there I was there when

M. hey pod cast lover the uncle Henry show is now available as a podcast on me I heart radio ad in the newest episode I talk about the budget battle between the mayor of mobile and the city council the Kavanaugh debacle I have a voice\nNicholson acquaint where here with you we have news headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings\nBills him for NBC News radio national correspondent bill good morning good morning I'll go Henry\nSo when I heard that NAFTA had been rewritten I got excited about it but as it is that premature bills for is this a done deal\nWell it's not quite a done deal because here's what has to happen now the agreement or it has been reached a Canada has a signed on Mexico assigned on the president loves that calls it an historic deal\nThe president will sign this it has to or it has to go through the evaluation process here but the president will sign it at the end of November then it has to be approved by all the legislatures the Mexican legislature Canadian legislature and our Congress or\nIf it's not a what happens is\nWe go back to NAFTA or that that would be back in effect the president then as a decision to make whether he would want to just withdraw from it which might require congressional approval as well but what we're getting pretty far down the road here but yes the answer your question it needs approval from all the legislatures in ball so it's really not a done deal yet\nSo I understand in our country especially that the politics involved that there are a lot of people that are opposed to President Trump just on general principle yeah um and that goes probably in Canada and Mexico\nDo you think that will stop these legislatures from passing this or will there be a a a more unbiased look at this\nAnd maybe it'll get through despite the fact that President Trump initiated it\n[noise] well ah I I think that uh you'd like to think that there will be an unbiased view I think Mexico is solidly on board with this I look for their legislature to approve it rather quickly uh in Canada the issue is with Canadian farmers who thought that they were thrown under the bus in this deal\nIn order to make a deal so they're not happy about it and then they carry substantial political weight so there could be a bit of a political debate in Canada over this sense I get this deal opens up a little more the Canadian dairy market who us farmers uh they're not happy about that in this country\nYeah you're right they're going to be those who will try to oppose anything that President Trump does its partisan politics at its finest but I really believe that uh that\nProbably will go through just because of the fact that anytime you can have an agreement between your two biggest trading partners as a bloc Canada and Mexico are by far our biggest trading partner together even bigger than China\nUh and and your neighbors to the north and south anytime you can have a trade agreement involving them I think that's good so overall it's good news now are there some things here that are I I ... I I Would question because uh you don't know about the long term effects absolutely\nYou're listening to build super NBC News radio national correspondent on another story that has to do with the economy what's going on with gas prices\nWell we're going up and and you better get ready for them to go up even more because ah the situation is this so right now gas prices are at a four year Hi Brent Crude or that ... the benchmark oil is it eighty four dollars a barrel which is the highest it's been in years\nAnd everybody is now waiting to see what happens with Iran those sanctions on Iranian oil or go into effect Iranian oil exports will go into effect November fourth if\nThey do or that that basically takes\nOver a million barrels of oil off the market uh and that is going to have an impact some are saying that oil mediate go to a hundred dollars a barrel\nSome in Iran are saying it could go to a hundred and forty dollars a barrel now you down there in mobiles are more fortunate than a lot of people your gas prices have been on the low end but still there\nAre you at the two fifty six a gallon on average a are substantially higher than they have been over the last couple of years so we were looking for a possible spike in oil and gas prices here\nNow is this something that um I just heard you run down the factors of why does this happen generally speaking at this time of year\nWell yeah always [laughter] ah there's always seems to be a reason for gas prices to go up or down whether it be the re formulation of gas they go to the winter blend or whatever that is\nA I remember one time it was I don't remember how long ago\nIt may have been ten years ago ... there were some pirate ditch they fired a gun near an oil rig in\nGas prices went up [laughter] I'm Serious I remember that story\nThere always seemed to be some whether it's a refinery maintenance or some of the offshore rigs are shut down for inspections there always seems to be a reason\nFor those oil prices go up but the big reason ear is with Iran which is the number three producer in OPEC with them being hit with these sanctions and the potential that their oil exports could go down to a President Trump wants to see him go down to zero if that would happen\nThere's no way that the the the production could be picked up by other people ... the president is asking Saudi Arabia to turn up the tab there\nTo try to increase production but uh I don't think that Saudi Arabia is going to go against Iran and Venezuela by the way which is also under us sanctions in order to pick up all of that law production\nBills for thank you for your time today You're welcome uncle Henry\nTheir egos bills for NBC News radio and national correspondent we're just about out of time here for this hour of Gulf Coast mornings\nThank you for listening to the Gulf Coast mornings you can find out more about me and more about Kelly minute by going to our Web sites loose talk one oh four nine dot com or news radio seven ten dot com [noise]\n\nThis is a Bloomberg Markets minute Amazon is raising the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour for all of the U.S employees the new wages effect is November first\nThe online retailers public policy team will also begin advocating for a boost in the federal minimum wage Amazon employees more than five hundred Seventy five thousand workers worldwide Pepsi beat earnings in revenue estimates and the latest quarter it's struggling North American never unit returned to grows\nThe maker of Mountain Dew into ... does also got a boost for much freedom lay unit the Pepsi lowered its earnings per share of you for the year to reflect currency headwinds ... futures are edging lower this morning crude oil remains little changed\nAnd some ... futures down nine points NASDAQ futures down thirty four down features down Ninety six nine next crude is down five cents at Seventy five dollars and twenty five cents a barrel ...

NBC News radio national correspondent Michael our mourning\nMourning uncle Henry happy to see you happy to say and say hello to Kelly Bennett good morning Kelly Bennett morning too yeah\nSo so uh how big is this investigation going to be because I thought it was going to be a week long and then I hurt did the president said the ... that they're going to expand the investigation\nYeah he said he would want the expansion of the investigation because there had been the reports that perhaps it was a very limited investigation that there were only for people to the White House was asking me up to investigate so the president opening up yesterday which is kind of following up some tweets that he had made saying that he wanted to have a full investigation and the ability to do that\nBut and this is sort of the caviar to it he wants to be done as quickly as possible now we know that Mitch McConnell has said he plans on having a vote by friday\nIf this indeed follows the guideline of the seven day investigation\nThat the senators were asking for the Judiciary Committee then that would mean that the should wrap up\nBy friday of this week so whether or not we actually see that we'll have seen those things shift and change here within the context of this hearing and the investigation so it could take a little bit longer but at least at this point Mitch McConnell's planning on having a vote friday at some point I think that's probably written in pencil 'cause that might be a little bit on the optimistic side but\nYou never know right now the FBI is currently conducting a thorough investigation they have\nSpoken to one person that according to Dr Ford was at the party with her and judge Kavanaugh when this incident happened that was legal and Kaiser so they spoke to leave when Kaiser on Saturday\nAnd then we saw the report yesterday of a former classmate of judge Kavanaugh was coming out saying that he was quite a drinker and that he would be belligerent and aggressive when he was drug told a story to the FBI about how\nCabinet got into a bar fight with I guess whoever the singer of you before he was a judge\nThis guy I Know I Know I wouldn't know what the guy looked like at all but judge Kavanaugh was apparently drinking thought this one person in the bar with this thing or if you'd be forty when that person said no a fight broke out and uh well judge Kavanaugh did not get arrested\nIt was a friend of his it did get arrested and Kevin I was interviewed by police so this is all something else the FBI is investigating right now\nSo you you'd be forty by the way famous for red red wine\nRed red well I think that's the only song they're famous for frankly obliterate\nOkay so yeah so you mentioned that um this this is pencil then for a vote friday\nYeah Mitch luminal can I throw ... here we go so far they've got this pencil then right and you get Mitch McConnell's got to stay on his\nCalendar ready to go but there was a story that broke last night from NBC News reporting\nAnd questioning now at the time frame the cabinet knew about the Deborah ... assault allegation she's the one who said he exposed himself to her when they were in college at Yale and then when the White House do about it because according to NBC News they have screen shots of text messages\nFrom some of Brett Kavanaugh springs in school they have all come about based upon it communication behind the scenes with these friends to try to refute the claims\nAgainst Deborah merits and they say that this may have happened back in July but the problem here is that if you may recall Kavanaugh told the Senate Judiciary committee under oath the\nFirst time he heard about remarriage that allegation was when the September twenty third article came out in the New Yorker\nThese text messages are dated and seemed to show going back into July but he was having conversations with friends trying to set up a story of a back story for himself\nBack in July so how long ago was it that he knew about these possible accusations and then how long did the White House no about or did he keep them in the dark did they know about it and they kept quiet about it a lot of questions that the FBI who has the screen shots and their position is going to have to investigate\nYou're listening to Michael by our NBC News radio national correspondent so if there is a vote friday or early next week do you think any votes will be changed by the FBI investigation\nI think if you believe Senator Jeff flake then he's got to have concerned about the believability here of of Kavanaugh because his concern was if there was anything that sort of brought up either the the he had been lying under oath that there was some sort of perjuring himself that that would certainly wiped clean\nAny consideration that he would have in regards to nominating Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court and I think that Lisa Murkowski is falling in love with that she would like to see this whole investigation happened\nSo I think there's still the possibility that some of those could die off I think you could also see some of those red state Democrats be really concerned about tying themselves here five weeks out from mid term elections to somebody who may have been lying certainly had questions about whether or not they told the truth and they're hearing so\nI think there's still a possibility that some of those votes could walk away from capital\nWe're at a time Michael Bowers thank you for your time and thank you for listening to Gulf Coast mornings [noise]\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute
