I Believe he started out doing magic trick says many of these wonderful psychics do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there are six cents kicks in and they

Mexico has issued what they called humanitarian transit visas and then migrants who are given the option of seeking asylum in Mexico or continuing on to the United states\nAre now are they are going to be stopped and now they may be given asylum in Mexico uh but uh I think the message is\nIf you had on to the United states or you have a you have the possibility of being turned around and sent right back uh so I think the reason that we're seeing this renewed cooperation well we just had the trade deal agreed to between the United states in Mexico\nAnd president Enrique Pena Nieto a who is only in office for another five weeks I think wants to continue cooperation with the United states as long as he is there now when the new president comes in Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\nOr he may be a little bit tougher here however already a spokesman for the incoming government has said they will cooperate\nWith this plan that Mexico wants to put in place right now but down the road there was always a possibility that Mexico could revert to some of its earlier policies\nOrange she'll builds up from where are they now are they add the Mexico border the southern Mexico border yet or are they still have a ways to go\nWell where we understand that as some have started arriving at the southern Mexico border now ...\nOr ... some of these people are on foot some are being ... being given ... we've seen pictures\nAnd videos of just people stopping with a flatbed truck and allowing people to jump on board so some of those people who may have gotten a as some kind of transportation\nAre beginning to arrive at the southern Mexican border now others are said to be as much as Andrea fifty miles away so this will be almost a steady stream of people coming in\nTo the Mexico border probably over the next week or so and I think there there may be another possibility that maybe as these people hear about this move by Mexico maybe they'll turn around I you know who who knows but I Would think that uh the UN involvement as big in this\nAll right hey bill ... thank you for your time today\nThank you very much uncle Henry I have a great weekend you to enroll tied\n... thank you for that thank you for that [laughter] bills or for knows what makes me happy\nOr give up that he squeeze that and that was great\nBut we're we're almost out of time here in this segment a one amateur more and more time again I'm Kelly Bennett tell people again where you're going to be tomorrow morning\nI Am going to be on the black sea town green I'll be there real early I think registration actually starts at eight o'clock for the making strides against breast cancer walk but I'm\nJust come out and joined us into dance fine and fundraising for the Cancer Society we really want to get rid of cancer that's really what it's all about and we want to have a good time it was very body the weather's been so nice right why would you not want to go out and\nDo a walk this weekend you're probably looking for something to do outside anyway this is a great that I Will\nBe at Havana raise cigar shop in lounge twenty three fifty one airport boulevard in midtown mobiles this evening a little after six o'clock playing ball throw up will be there for the grand opening looking forward to that he thank you for listening to Gulf Coast morning [laughter]\n\nBloomberg market shares in front during gamble or higher in pre market\nWriting this morning the company posted surprisingly strong growth and a key sales measure last quarter\nHelped by gains and beauty and health care organic sales which exclude items such as acquisitions and currency affects rose four percent topping analysts productions those looking for extra holiday work may want to check out Nordstrom which is holding a company wide hiring day today at at stores and distribution centers\nNordstrom plans to hire around twenty four thousand additional workers for the holiday retail period\nAmerican Express has been on a quest to be accepted everywhere and it seems to be paying off\nAnd that's long known for pitching it's card to a more high end market boosted its forecasts for profit for the year as a trim fees to attract smaller businesses\nStop future is going to a higher Wall Street open as in the futures of ten points and I make screwed it sixty nine dollars Twenty one since ... a barrel ...

B. U. V. in Biloxi and news radio seven ten WN GM in Ninety nine five FM the jag immobile news headlines coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back\nTo Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent Michael ... Michael good\nMorning he won't go Henry and good morning Kelly Happy Friday to you both\nNow ... ... on this this story of the ... we've been referring to this is the missing Saudi journalist and I've noticed that today a lot of the news organizations have switched over in her ... starting to say now assumed murdered Saudi journalist so we we both knowledge that this has happened yet\nWe knowledge that at least according to Turkish officials and again we're relying heavily on the Turkish officials here to conduct investigation 'cause it's happening in their land in any evidence that's happening in regards to what might be a murder or\nTheir responsibility there digging up the evidence they're pulling things together they're creating a timeline for all of this to happen so when they say that they have evidence that could show he was murdered were kind of believing that element of it now as far as the facts\nThat we know we know that he showed up to the conflict to show he did and that others video proof of that happening to the end of the consulate\nAnd then he never left the consulate aside from that those are the facts that we know at this point we're waiting for the investigation from the Turkish officials and frankly from the Saudi officials as well\nAs to what happened in between then what happened to show he hasn't been seen since then we know that yesterday Turkish officials are took to investigating a forest area a bright sort of close by where the consulate is where they feel or some of the fans from the Saudi consulate made their way through this war so they've got\nA cadaver dogs out sniffing around trying to see if they can find anything maybe it's possible that they\nA toss some body parts of the show is they're they're not exactly sure but they are conducting this investigation and they're saying to everybody in a worldwide\nThey're expecting to have this investigation wrapped up here in a matter of days which is also what Mike Pompeo\nHas asked President Trump or just a few days so that these groups would have the ability to conduct their investigations improper fashion\nSo where where does this leave us diplomatically\n[noise] oh that's a good question uncle Henry and I think that that's a question of ... that we get to see I think right now everything is on pause almost everything is on ... so we saw yesterday that Mike Pompeo\nCame back from his trip to not only Saudi Arabia but also the turkey told President Trump that they needed a few more days to investigate or the Saudis the Turks did to investigate what happened to Jamal show you so that the president is kind of said okay that's fine we can definitely do that and I think that by some time\nFor the U.S to figure out where they stand in regards to Saudi Arabia and what worst case scenario will look like in regards to if they have to apply sanctions on some level or have you know some sort of of of repercussions are consequences for the Saudis I'm One of the big questions here was a report that Mike Pompeo had heard\nThis audio tape that the Turks say that they have the actual data to show and that he was given a copy the transcript well that was rescinded today by Turkey's foreign minister saying that his country is not shared any audio recordings from the disappearance with U.S officials are which backs up what Mike Pompeo was saying about all this but\nThere's two questions here in DC in regards to mobile hold on a second didn't pop he'll go out there to collect back was as a fact finding missions so he went out to Saudi Arabia but then\nHis own words did not talk about facts with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia then he went over to turkey and apparently didn't ask for or demand to hear the tape or see the transcripts that the Turkish officials are saying uh proves the murder of ... by Saudi Arabia so\nWhat exactly was your fact finding mission and what did you bring back and talk to the president about and those are questions that are short to be asked year over the next couple of days before we get to the end of the investigations from the Turkish officials\nSo Michael power if the Turks say we finished the investigation and and they did it the Saudis did it in and here's how we know they did it and then the Saudis say no we didn't\nShow didn't watch for ah what do we do that\nWell and so then I think we ... it from there you go\nLook at the evidence that whatever the Turks have led them to believe that it was the Saudis who did it if they release a copy of this tape that they say that they have I Believe that that would be difficult for the Saudis to say that they didn't have anything to do with it um there's also reports today that the Saudis are kind of stepping up storylines and\nNew York times is reporting that the rulers of Saudi Arabia are considering blaming a top intelligence official close to the crowd than we were like almost\nUncomfortably close to the crown prince we're talking about a mentor a major general a bottle of sorry who is a raking advisor to the crown prince and they're saying that that would be an extraordinary recognition\nOf somebody so close to the crown prince and gold in this uh but again I guess that's what you have to do when you're talking about the magnitude of this international backlash so they're looking at that as a possibility um again\nWe'll have to see what the investigation shows that we already know that whatever it was a puppy or how to tell President Trump yesterday when he had a briefing\n... there was a change of two from President Trump you know see the secretary of treasury stimulation is not going to go to the big investment conference it was going to be out by the crown prince and Saudi Arabia I think that's a huge step for the U.S as well as other\nCountries around the world who decided not to send somebody there it's a big move for the U.S who consider Saudi Arabia to be a huge ally to step away so we're not going to be attending the conference I think makes a big political ... and at a statement that that they have to know closer look at what might be ramifications if indeed the Saudis are found that done this\nOr we're at a time Michael ... thank you for your time today enjoy your weekend\nThere goes Michael Bauer NBC News radio national correspondent at a time for this hour of
