five FM jak immobile\nIt's six thirty five coming up and about Fifteen minutes we're going to talk to bills for NBC News radio about a ministry\nThere's or fiance of a missing Saudi journalist asking President Trump to help\nBecause this journalist was last seen entering the Saudi ... consulate in Turkey and they figure there's been foul play so we'll get into that coming up in about Fifteen minutes before we get to that ... minute we we have Health News today yeah there are a couple of\nPrescription drug pricing bills and in the books now signing the bills yesterday President Trump said that what they'll do is free pharmacists to discuss lower drug prices with patients\nTo crack down on so called a gag clauses in Medicare part D plans these pauses prevent pharmacist from telling patients about more affordable options\nSay the bills were made of so called gag orders on pharmacists allowing them to inform people when the cash\nPrice for prescription drug is lower than the price in a patient's health insurance policy\nLongstanding gag orders that existed in contract between insurance providers and pharmacies wanted to build covers Medicare and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries and the other applies to employer based in individual policies\nDid you even know there was a gag order involved in getting your prescriptions filled I mean I had no idea my pharmacist couldn't make me aware if I'm getting this expensive drug if there was something that he has got back there that cost less\nWhy do you want your pharmacist to share that information whether you would put this gag order and Brian went\nWell this is a this is something I've only learned about recently the fact that pharmacies and insurance companies get together and have these deals where they set prices\nAnd many if these deals weren't done there are a lot of cases where prescription drug costs might even be lower than the co pay\nA so it's it's almost a ... I don't I don't want to use the wrong language here um [noise]\nIt's it's like the price is being set\nA above market value in these deals and I just think we'd all be better off as consumers if we knew as much as we could about our health care and what it costs so many times if you have to go into a hospital or something a lot of us never really understand\nThe true price we just understand what we've got a what what we're paying and insurance and what the co pay is and don't know about those negotiations between insurance companies and\nHealthcare providers I think this is great I we need as much transparency as possible in our health care just so we can we can all learn how to make better informed decisions\nWouldn't it be outrageous if you found out that you were paying a co pay for a prescription drug that you need every month and the actual cash price without insurance might have been cheaper [noise]\nYeah I mean I I just don't see why but he had this kind of law to begin with I'm Glad that they've changed it and I I agree that transparency is important it's hard enough to understand your own health insurance without trying to understand the costs of the drugs that you need trafficking whether together every ten minutes on and on and then right back with more [noise]\nTime saver traffic wherever picked up a couple of new accidents automobiles this is on these from

that I have not been able to to pay full attention to we met a lot going on in the last week or so tell us about the missing Saudi journalist\nYeah this story is kind of a combination of international espionage and and the ... the mob or it it really is something that uh you could see a as a as a spy movie or something having to do with something like that here here's the situation\nIf it's around ... by the name of Joe ... who was a Saudi journalist who left Saudi Arabia really for his own protection\nAfter writing articles that have had been critical of the royal family\nAnd a religious leaders in Saudi Arabia he moved to this country lived in Virginia became a contributor for the Washington Post\nHe hasn't been seen since October second when he went to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey in order to get paperwork he needed to marry a Turkish woman\nSo ah the investigation is underway and Turkish investigators have come up with a scenario where they say that the show was murdered inside the Saudi consulate and may have been dismembered\nI in fact they have identified a Fifteen Percent hit squad they saved flew in from Saudi Arabia to conduct this act now this has taken on international implications now since\n... was a resident of the United states his fiance is now calling on President Trump to get involved and twenty two senators have now\nSigned on to a request for an investigation into this incident and that this was something that really could have a lot of foreign policy implications for the United states and Saudi Arabia\nWhich has become a valuable ally and so I'm On that the Trump Administration is relying on for\nEverything from a military cooperation to cooperation and the global oil market so this is a real balancing act that the Trump Administration is on here as we try to get to the bottom of what happened to drive all ...\nOkay so why or what is what is it about him that would require a death squad being dispatched\nWell when you write articles in Saudi Arabia that our number one critical of the royal family and number two critical of religious leaders you become an enemy of the state uh in fact the U.S intelligence reportedly ...\nDeceptive communications where a Saudi authorities wanted to lure 'cause she'll be back to Saudi Arabia and then detained him there now they haven't discovered anything that would lead to the fact that they would murder him a but still there he was was considered an enemy of the state in Saudi Arabia\nBuilds up or do you think we can trust the intel from turkey\n[noise] I I don't know it it seems to me that it's pretty clear though this much we do know there is surveillance video that shows show gate\nEntering the consulate there is no video evidence of him ever leaving the consulate even though Saudi Arabia says yo yo he left\nA there is no video evidence and despite the fact there are cameras inside the Saudis say they were not recording at the time\nAnd it even gets more diabolical than this uh he when he went to the consulate it was early in the afternoon and all consulate members had been given the afternoon off a so\nIt really adds up to the possibility that there was some type of conspiracy are underway and turkey Turkish officials have laid it out they even believe now there's a possibility that his remains may be buried in the garden\nOf the consul general in Istanbul\nWow this is the what a horrible story\nYeah yeah ... it really is and uh you can imagine how his fiance must field [laughter]\nOh yeah ... ... this I'm I'm surprised that a turkey has all of this very specific um in information that they were able to figure out\nYeah and they have tracked uh a couple of private air flights that went from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul they say that these were the flights that carry this Fifteen person squad\nOr into Saudi Arabia they have already checked the surveillance video and now the search is underway for apparently Mr could show we wore one of those apple watches a so they say if they can find that uh it wouldn't\nTell you things like his his heart everything from his heart rate to his location or so or they are of the investigation continues and meanwhile in this country uncle Henry they're already been calls from some including Senator Chris Murphy that the U.S needs to rethink its military political\nAnd economic relationship to Saudi Arabia all of which run very deep\nWell and we've been hearing this since nine eleven right\nOh yeah absolutely uh because uh yeah there are Saudi connections to nine eleven as well\nUh but then they become a valuable ally of the United states in that region both militarily and you remember President Trump recently requested Saudi Arabia increase their oil production and over in order to stabilize the global oil market so we have a lot of connections to two and a the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was recently\nAs the White House ah [laughter] so there are a lot of close connections

possible rate increase for the postal service\nYou may be shelling out a little more for your mail soon without more on that from Fox is Jill NATO the postal service wants to raise the cost of a first class stamp by five cents bringing it to fifty five cents total it's approved by regulators the increase would be the biggest we've seen since Nineteen Ninety One\nThe service claims to be bleeding money because of a drop in the amount of mail it carries the increase request comes after President Trump blasted the postal service for losing a fortune by not charging higher shipping rates for Amazon dot com and other online retailers\nThe service has been seeing some strong gains in package deliveries but that's been outweighed by pension and health care costs\nIn Washington Jill NATO Fox News so Kelly ... there was\nA rally I'm I'm Sorry there was a rally on Monday at different locations across the country including in Biloxi pops very a location at the post office because the idea\nHas actually been to possibly privatize the postal service that that came from um President Trump I Believe\nAnd they're obviously the postal service workers are concerned about their job right and you know their benefits and that kind of thing so Columbus Day which was a federal holiday for a lot of people there were a lot of rallies across the country from postal workers\nSo what are people mail mail though I mean back back in the day we use the mail and quite a bit we'd sent postcards we'd write letters to each other we ... we send them all all of our bills in the mail what are people use them what are people use stamps for now\nDo you manage to anybody are you writing letters to your family members\nWell uh now I I think about maybe Christmas cards there when he even do some of that over the Internet now don't we you know birthday cards you print that kinda thing up here here's what's kind of funny about this and I don't mind paying fifty five cents for a stamp that's fine\nSo I started thinking about the the rise in prices dance and I didn't even know what I paid for a book at stamps because I just go when I Want a book of first class stamps and it lasts me so long\nThat I don't remember what I paid for the last time I bought a book a stamps [laughter]\nSo that is that what I'm saying is\nBecause you don't mail the way you used to a ... last year a lot

the same time it's got to change somehow just because of the technology we have of right now the ... the major deliveries at our country are all packages [noise]\nAnd not ... cards and letters the way
