this seven years ago you said correct yeah I mean in those days I don't think there was a bar violation but do you want to get back at him for a screw your wife at the time or you just basically want to blow it off\nWell you know I don't know if you're going to make it but yeah you're gonna make life\nMiserable so ah if you want to you certainly can I don't think much is going to come of it or they're going to do a bar investigation he's going to obviously you have to defend themselves probably hire a lawyer or an expert in representing a representing a represent their lawyers who represent warriors in front of the bar\nAnd um you know I was ah oh and I I once had a complaint against\nTo me that was quite had a couple of complaints against these crazy crazy complaints ... a basic based on the handle on the law the advice I give because some people it took me seriously\nI relied on that so anyway but I had to you know I brought in a lawyer or who specialize\nIn this the first time out or when I was actually friday night now I Know bother so it's your call\nHere called do I think anything's going to come of it no why as I said because it wasn't a conflict it was the whites you were a notch\nUh being uh you were not a she was not being representative wasn't a divorce case where there was clearly a conflict so ah I just think the two of them got it on\nA daily rate there your whole anyway yes\nOh All right um um oh\nGod I hate these winds All right let's try it a ...\nWe just lost you know there should be technology out there that overcomes this wouldn't you think by this day and age I mean we send\nThe guy to the moon that doesn't work anymore last time there was a guy in the moon was in the seventies so that's kind of stupid so we're going to be able we can send a guide to Mars right at some point and so he calls back he calls back All right oh hello Chris\nWelcome to handle on the law Chris yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to a man that tax return from Eighteen years ago and I could get a refund paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot okay now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from earn like sixteen years I don't know how to amend a tax return that would join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that because if the law allows someone to file\nAn amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partner their spouse or ... is not around either can't be found a somewhere out there I remarried die whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules the IRS\nBecause the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules I Know when you file your tax returns you have an accountant\nChris yeah yeah have you asked your accountant about this\nYet her and he wasn't curve any way through it then you have and I happen to have an appointment with the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is under yeah that's the way\nI'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast expertise would not only this is a tax law or this or tax returns and of course I you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I sit and researcher look it up and am I counting Chris\nJust like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several accountants you make an appointment with the IRS and your mind a Crick\nDrafted that I actually find it might go and uh maybe a picnic or just magically appear\nNo no I I I don't know if I I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is do I have to\nFind her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her\nAnd ask about Seventy grand behind the counter right that's another issue in this\nArea and you and and you may be able to get\nThe whole thing okay based on the child support order\nSo I the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to half of that yeah\nNow there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off I mean it'll grab people's money\nAre cases in that state right now we're ... supposed to be surrender\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS agent and and if the IRS agent doesn't know that rule specifically and it doesn't have any experience or or doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's a pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as ... and IRAs Asian who doesn't I understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you've ever look at the Internal Revenue code\nThese our phone books thick with hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally for real to amend after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask\nMe I would've said no but if they passed\nA law that is a different than we're in great shape\nIt's for military better yeah obviously are gone forever yeah All right so is there any of them out there and get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow description of a very narrow group of people and so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man I'm there's nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything right\nAlso let me tell you about life like here's something they do right and life lock protects your identity and\nOf course another hack this was Facebook Fifteen million accounts of course why not there isn't a person in this country has

Brian and Mali sharing about operation we cannot Ryan just what is operation we cannot\nFinished what you're doing their stays safe and come home but in hindsight\nOf course it was a great conversation has led us to where we are now\nBut from a spouse standpoint you just think we just focus on ones here too [laughter] and come back home as soon as\nPossible we all want you years so bad but it's amazing that the way that military you know brothers and sisters all support each other and I always thinking of ways to help one another out whether that's all the way across the world or when they get back here I think that's\nWhat's really cool about the whole thing is that started with you know two brothers from the same unit coming up with a great idea on how to help each other [noise]\nRyan and Mali Sherry are are here with us ah you're celebrating your fourth anniversary of this idea that you started\nYes ma'am up from the inception the Facebook page or was actually hit a maid live on September twenty four two thousand fourteen so while you were in Afghanistan yes ma'am okay I'm In the air force we have access the Internet\n[laughter] well but but you you wait till you got home to to get the ball rolling\nNo um didn't know where it was going to go but in September a while we were still in Afghanistan and again you can you can scroll to our Facebook page and look at the very first post as says basically this was an idea of\nYou know we're going to give time to military families when they returned from deployment we didn't have all the answers at that point in time ah but we were able to to put put everything together over then the next six to eight months\nHow many service people have you reconnected with their families through this program\n[noise] we've been and operations in February of two those Nineteen will actually celebrate our fourth anniversary so we've just been an operations three and a half years and we've already served several hundred families or we should be able to hit five hundred or in the next six to eight to ten months\nUm but at the end of the day it's not about the number of families for us so that is that's\nMy hundred families that have reconnected with their they've gotten to that gift of time that's huge it\nWe're just getting started [laughter]\nThat's that's really all I can tell you is we're just getting started they were the resources are available I mean we're one of the most richest nations in the history of the entire world um I mean just in Gulf shores in orange beach alone we have over fourteen thousand lodging accommodations while we not all our military families to utilize the resources that we already have\nNow you've had lots of companies um help you like companies and individuals donate 'em condos and and other places to say\nYes ma'am uh operation reconnect is the mechanism uh but we would not have any success whatsoever if it wasn't for the ... community collaboration that exist\nI'm from businesses that are in a variety of industries whether it be the restaurant industry entertainment lodging I'm to the to the local city ... municipalities such as the city of Orange Beach um\nEverybody is contributing what they can that their business will allow them um and it's it's been overwhelming support\nAnd the generosity that are families have been able to receive this I I really don't have any words for Mali\nYeah I think I mean something that's very very special to us is when people come here it's not just the condo\nThey also the communities and so amazing to provide the in the floor ban law allows us to use their boats and their jet skis so they can allow the sale wild heart company takes him out on sale trips alligator alley let some come enjoy their park\nThose are the Gulf Coast zoo\nAll kinds of tacky Jack's gift cards and yacht club an old river grill gift cards it's just been amazing when people get here\nThey also get to do fun activities and have meals and things like that that it just takes a burden off of them for the expense of the trip as well so they can really treat their kids and their spouses to a really amazing time and utilize all the amazing things that the Gulf Coast has to offer\nWhat's it like when you when someone comes to to the Gulf I mean you meet them to check them in for their operation reconnect what what does that process like what what's it like for the family\nSaturdays or the front of the day of my week are typically our families stay from Saturday to Saturday [noise] um but\nIt's unique experience because they look like a deer in headlights they'd walk and they walk into the office still don't believe a program Israel or that is true they're they're waiting for the catch there waiting for the you know the deposit or you you know some some you know taxes or something you know something is going to come up and bite them\nAnd we essentially go over the things that are in our area provide them a map to the a condominium that they're staying at\nGiven the keys to the property or the access information and essentially ask them to leave our office at that point in time and and they just look at us will what what do you need from us and the answer is always you've already pre paid for this please leave our offices and go enjoy your seven\n[laughter] get started now is not\nTo be rude but didn't they they have walk out of her office with their their neck looking at us and half looking at the door um but that's I think the most unique part of what we do and and not a lot of people know this and um we don't want to share too much but that's just the beginning of the experience because when they arrived to the property\nMolly and hurt her team put together these beautiful customize welcome baskets we don't just have wells one welcomed basket that works for every family when the famous register on our website they tell us their preferred family style vacation if again maybe they're you know\nA couple of new young twenties and they want to participate in all of the night life that the the beach has to offer we will put them in a location that is close to those attractions um or if your family from a busy city such as ... and you want to get away from people you can go out and Fort Morgan so\nWe customize those the gift certificates and things that\nAre given to our family is based on what they request and what what they'd like\nUm again one example is if if there are water family and they just want to be on the water the entire week we can give them pontoon boats with partnership with a ... kayaks paddle boards or the sale wild hearts cruise so we can almost put that family on the water the entire seven days that they're here um\nThat's a beautiful part of it is is just making it what the family prefers\nWhen can we talk just a moment about a who qualifies what families qualify for the straight but\nAs ... as simple as the organization is the qualification of simple if you've been on a combat deployment post nine eleven so if you are a post nine eleven combat veteran you qualify for operation reconnect any branch any rank does not matter\nIf you don't know what a combat deployment as you may not qualify or anybody in the military can tell you within a split second if they've been on a combat deployment and yes that that is different for every branch I'm In the air force\nWe do have boots on the ground however somebody in the navy might be on the ship they they may not have boots on the ground in Afghanistan but they may be patrolling the seas around Iran or some other combat areas there's combat going on all over this world I Can't tell you a lot of details are right now on the radio but there are conflicts\nAre that we know and as David mentioned moments ago a speaks to the church and churches\nAll over the country traveling at least a hundred thousand miles a year to speak on reconciliation so beyond what you're doing there in Richmond with Arab on and how you're reaching churches locally\nKind of walk us through I guess uh what has happened in the last couple of years David as your ministry has progressed leading us what we'll talk about a little bit later about the event coming up at Stanford University ... where are you finding most impact right now with your ministry\nWell I found the most impact really is what the word of God I'm part of what happened about\nA ten years ago but what we started this ministry we also thought a church that was a at a location original Virginia ... caught Churchill that was economically and racially first\nI come from a strong biblical Christian background where we could theoretically we read scriptures and we also aids and um or the ministry and um\nWhen we started to bring this church together and started to worshipping together we realized it was harder than putting them is a statement on our website ah we never actually practice of worship ... worshipping together and be in a relationship with people who would I have a different race and culture and then you but ...\nSays socio economic and class difference and that was very hard very difficult and so when we look at\nWhat resources were out there that could practically help was um your hat\nWaste is also a theory that was a little of it not by by just the fact that it's a social science discipline and then you had what I call Kristin by\n... by a type of uh the the theology that really wasn't that a positive theologically for these past ... concern is that what we did was we\nDig into the scriptures I'm trying to see some of the best practices and um and I was at the history of our country and really try to do our best to make it look will face but witness practically help with the local church to engage effectively them as the rest of the nation and so\nThat evolved to be in a thing where people around the country started to ask us what to do it how to do this is over the last ten years we've been teaching and and equipping um folks practically most Chris says what do the right thing we just don't know how to guys give us an industry to help you figure that out\nWe're talking to David Bailey on viewpoint today who will be in Birmingham next week as I understand it David or an event on the campus of Stanford University\nA documentary entitled hope for
