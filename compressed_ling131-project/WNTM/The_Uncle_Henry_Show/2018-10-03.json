{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "[noise] what we've had a gentle warming again we've had a degree in the last hundred and Thirty years and so there's a little bit of ... at the north pole and I'd Greenland but the amazing thing is the uh the south pole ISIS getting thicker I Love the show a picture of the Amundson Scott station\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the uh the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody come up with a right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nUp and they leave built\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow\nAnd that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ice is getting thicker in the south pole but on that we've lost a little bit\nUm if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice and have fallen off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew I knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is that there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have a big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about the city's not want renewable energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent\nOf renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar and people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries\nSo this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure uh some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the cost of a wholesale electricity\nAnd that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about on my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes on now they are all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out\nCovered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way um our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants rolled down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in a worse fate [noise]\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get the nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story or from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming matches yeah yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at the grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October in a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will and fight\nA climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible a man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles this the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nPerhaps a little way there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of which cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages\nThen we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that a scientist believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they're fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example and a regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycle so the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real it's like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate would you\nSign up now for ... zone or free

the liberal both sides claim to be highly energized going into the midterms and I don't really know how to gauge it\n\nAnd it's a little more it's more difficult to gauge it and the reason I say that is because we've learned over the past year especially that social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook tended to suppress right wing stuff\nAre being shared\nAnd I know you've heard all about it and you can research it yourself but we've we've learned that the major social media platforms\nAre they're not they are not big fans of anything conservative and that stuff doesn't get spread as much

unlike any other\nFor the most part bunny seems like your average seven year old Labrador Retriever she loves being outside rolling in the grass and most of the poll swimming in flight creek behind her family's for hope home ... scars from a fight few other dogs can match a battle with nearly ten foot alligator\nVery lucky obviously that it was a more shocked and used to being the aggressor not used to being attacked by Labrador\nCan't brewer bunnies owners says she was home alone last Thursday when a family friend came by to let her out to play money ran right to the water for one of her favorite hobbies charging and dragging logs three times or size from the creek only this time her target wasn't really a log\nShe swam full bore towards the gator it opened his mouth has a warning and she collided with directly ah went under twice came up from fifty yards back to the dog\nBunny made it to shore with several gashes from the alligators clause in a scratch on her face but otherwise she was okay that's where the gator brewer says it was later removed by wildlife officials\n... a best guess is that they're not used to be an attack and it puts the gate and defensive mode and it never turns to charge Barney or just swim away\nAlligators are very common threw out our area but brewer says they don't often see large ones in flight creek he's just got this one didn't take a member of his family\nIt's a scary thing to think about her aggressive\nPassionate nature and for retrieving huge logs may have saved her in this case\n... says they were aware of sightings of a large alligator and had been keeping their jobs away from the creek until bunnies expected to make a full recovery in ... county I'm Corey tip and NBC Fifteen\nAnd a ... just made me contemplate what goes on in the mind of a dog that its passionate about retrieving low\n\nI don't I don't know where I don't know how to process that but the the alligator was not used to being charged by do so the alligator left\nGood\nGood\nSo happy ending to the story and the alligator was removed and I don't know what that means I don't know if they relocate the alligator\nAs you if you've listened to me for any time at all you understand them very anti alligator\nAnd I would wish that the alligator would go to some like a booth factory or or something like that that they would send the alligator off to be processed so that mankind could benefit from the alligator or from the alligator scanned and the alligator meat\nRather than be terrorized by the alligator waiting to eat members of our families\nSo happy ending their\nPassion for retrieving logs that's an interesting\nI Wish I could do\nI Need to find something to be passionate about that is that is at that level that may be the

B. the anvil Lexington\nNews headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines were what a welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings Michael Bauer NBC News radio national correspondent Michael good morning\nGood morning or good morning Kelly unhappy ones they to you both\nThat'd be Wednesday and so on I was quite shocked yesterday when I was hearing the news that the FBI investigation could be over today or tomorrow is that right\nYeah there was even talk I said it could've been done as of yesterday for the wall Street Journal officially is reported that although the FBI had until friday to complete the investigation both GOP eight and a person Tamil here with the matter expected to wrap up\nWell beforehand so that means it could be today it could be tomorrow it gets to travel and it tomorrow on some level but neither case certainly giving the timeframe for Mitch McConnell to get his friday vote in while still having time to review the FBI Files in documents regardless investigation clearly fits into that and all the time for it right out now\nThat said the FBI investigation according to lawyers for Dr ... Ford and Deborah marriage should be in question uh they both independently lawyer in law groups complained independently yesterday that the FBI was not pursuing important leads we know\nA doctor bloody Ford has not yet been interviewed by the FBI nor have the witnesses that they identified as being at the party when this whole legit sexual assault took place are those people that they thought could corroborate their story it not been interviewed by the FBI either according to the lawyer so they both\nOn completely independent of each other wrote letters to the FBI and the chief counsel to let them know that they thought this investigation wasn't question\nSo so then then where do we go from here I mean as I Know people are gonna complain that the FBI investigation is over early and that certain people weren't talked about a ... do you think this the the FBI will be told to try again or is it all going to be done\nI I Can't fathom them I Can't fathom anybody agreeing to hey go back to the drawing board or get back to\nSkiing this up and continuing your investigation I Can't fathom that having especially when Mitch McConnell is so dead set on having this vote on friday but I Will say this a half of the up yet to defend them at all but what we're hearing in regards to the FBI investigation is that this has become sort of an all hands on deck\nElement to this investigation they are sending in a everybody from a brand new newbies and the FBI to conduct investigations and get some information to the seasoned veterans who are very familiar with interviewing people to come off of cases in order to sit down with people involved in this particular case so it's very possible that this could be an expedient element to this because of\nThe manpower that they're putting into it I guess that's been going to weigh on whatever it is Jeff Flake a Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski are all see and the two red state Democrats who are kind of all up in the air\nI think if they don't see what they consider to be a full investigation like if you don't actually go back and talk to Christine lousy for it at some point I don't know you can call this a complete investigation and that's going to throw their votes and the question\n\nSo [noise] what about ... what about flake his he already told us that he's not going to vote that he thinks the capitals to political so she's going to be an automatic no\nThat's a really good question and I I feel like that game has been up to a little bit from the based upon what\nPresident Trump did yesterday and his rally where he was kind of mocking Christine Blasey Ford I think that there was an element of Jeff Flake kind of stepping up his game and say listen I mean I I don't know how right now Lisa Murkowski Susan calls are going to go back and face any of their women voters on any level going into the midterms or anything else\nWhen you have to try to defend with the president did last night which is on the heels of the president saying that he thought I'm Christine Blasey Ford was a credible witness so\nThere's that element to this but Jeff Flake now kind of stepping up his game and saying with all of these questions with the stories that have been breaking about his drinking after after a judge Kavanaugh has sort of vehemently defend it as drinking we don't know I can tell you if if he's had enough drinks to get blackout drunk\nWe do know that there was a letter coming out today in the New York times from Nineteen eighty three\nIn which judge Kavanaugh refers to he and his buddies he and his friends who are all going to a beach week as obnoxious drunks with prolific ... among us now\nI don't know if that's enough to blackout drunk but in my past opinion it would certainly do that in my past experience that would certainly do that but he also signed that letter with five apps which we've talked about in regards to what the testimony was and the worst part\nRather than Brett and we also know bart Kavanaugh was a character that one of his friends are put into a book\nBrett Kavanaugh was asked if that was based upon him he said he didn't know you'd have to ask the journal of the writer well he signed this bar Kevin all we know that this is judge Kavanaugh who wrote this letter wasn't somebody else so there are questions that Jeff Flake just has about this guy that I think could sway his vote\nThis ah just hearing your last explanation just makes me wonder who's going to play all these people in the movie\nI Can't wait to see I mean I think right off the bat if you had Matt Damon from Saturday Night live playing Brett Kavanaugh that would work and I think Brett Kavanaugh will be happy with that to\nOrange so I probably ask you this before I'll ask you again\nWhat is this going to be over one way or the other one way or the other\nView I feel like and again we all know how these things shift right of butter from day to day things could change I Would say I would expect by friday night for this group I think we head into the weekend having at least some idea of this thing being wrapped up whether or not we know it ... and I got the votes to become the next Supreme Court justice\nI don't know but I think we are certainly a step closer so I think\nWe starting next week not even caring about this any more moving on to something else\nAll right Michael ... thank you for your time today\nOn

M. and Ninety nine five at the end the jak immobile\nComing up in our next segment and a little less than ten minutes we're going to talk to build so for NBC News radio national correspondent\nHe's going to tell us about the first lady's first solo trip as first lady she's visiting Africa and also the U.S versus China over the drugs but no we'll get into that and our next segment before we get to that though there is a study out\nA recent study from the University of Alabama at Birmingham claiming that southern style cooking that soul food\nMay be killing African Americans because African Americans are more likely to develop hypertension\nThan others and this study they followed seven thousand adults for over nine years tracking cholesterol blood pressure diet and they're saying that southern style diets with fried fish\nChicken potatoes sweet tea all that kind of stuff they say that seems to be the culprit\nThat in the southern style food that is causing people to develop hypertension especially people in the African American community so um I've got let's see I've got an opinion on this\nFrom someone that prepares this kind of food for a living this was Maurice White he is the the owner of big white wings in ... Alabama he disagrees with this study\nIs not really to southern food they're doing is sometimes people\nOver do is to cook it you know what I mean do too much out too much or where you would know season on the fries mistakes or what the bell peppers and onions they normally\nFlavor uh hold you can get around salt\nAnd all the sea\nSo he says don't blame the food just blame the seasoning\nSalt\nSalt and and and grease\nGrease I I think I got to agree with them there at the end and we do don't wait\nI'm over eat certain kinds of foods so here's here's a quick example because I Love southern cooking and I was raised by a southern among them and that woman she put everything in Greece and she left the grease in there you know how you drain degrees the first time I saw somebody drain Greece\nWhich I had never seen my mom do growing up I was like what are you doing [laughter]\nDo you do did agree that's the flavor of the thing that you're throwing down that you know what are you doing with that\nUm but everything in moderation I think\nIs really the key and salt is a big thing you know you know long ago Henry that I I recently went on this weight loss program and I managed to take thirty pounds off I really did learn to season my food\nWithout all the salt and the butter butter is a big thing that I've given up and and we put butter on everything there is just\nUm I don't know I\nI think I'm going to have to agree with the\nSouthern cooking you can't have it every day man it's generally a treat\nIt's too late for me this information's too late for me I cannot yeah I'm too old to change my ways fried chicken is my favorite food on the planet\nAnd you're just not that you're not going to separate me from it [laughter] that are coming up next we're

right here we\nGo here we go and you know they talked about this this morning already I'm not sure but we had a cheerleading coach she was at ... at one of our parks\nOr when she kind of fought back because much teenagers were yelling upset of these that are nine and an eight year old cheerleaders\nAnd if things went downhill from there so um\n[noise] that it turned into a the girl that was yelling at the coach or when the coach told her to stop and yell at her instead of the kids then mom and sister and another woman got involved and that's when they started getting ... that's when when they started smack and\nUh and they tend to beat up the the cheerleading coach she has a she swollen for close to her face\nOh my gosh yeah I Know she just she they literally beat her up because she said stop yelling upset at ease at my little girls and now that creative class seat felony\nSay they're eight and nine year old cheerleaders corral and she's all into our coach so she has volunteered

a fish to solve a problem you have a problem uh and you don't need to be around kids 'cause obviously there is a big problem with you if if you indeed are using bothers to settle a problem\nAmong children well among\nAnybody really unless you know [noise] what what\nWas more disturbing to me Darwin is is the mom is in on it and her teenagers that are following suit so it it's a whole and running in the family so moms that never an example right\nNow so you're perpetuating this violence to another generation ah and then what will they do with their kids so you see this uh [noise] there's just no nothing good that comes out of this and it's\nIt's a familiar story how many times that we heard a I mean there's so many good parents uh I was I was in little league when I was a kid\nI remember having disagreements but I don't remember any parrot ever being overbearing and and ... violent it it never even entered our mind\nUh so I don't know if if this is a product of a culture today or the programs we watch or [noise] I don't know\nIt's disturbing because that wasn't a part of of my life in those early days\nOf course I was a lousy player but that's beside the point right\nYeah this is the the the seriousness that people take these things to\nWhen you're dealing with an with eight and nine year olds or whether they're cheerleading or playing\nThat level of seriousness I don't understand why we have to invest so much seriousness in it\n... it was you know 'cause it's fun about twenty five years ago somebody asked me to help them with a a girls' softball team and these were like third graders are like around that age\nSo we're we're all practicing at night and I saw strange man all by himself watching the practice and I thought well this is creepy these are these little girls and there's this strange man washing the practice so I asked other adults I said what's going on wires dismay and watching\nThe may explained oh he's he scouting he's he was a coach from another team of like nine year old and he wanted to see\nJust how the competition was doing so this is some forty five year old man that wow that that's what he that he thought that was a good used was time to go out and watch other\nNine year olds ... practice so he could coach them and I thought why does it have to be that serious why do we have to have so seriously\nPerhaps it's more pleasant to be at the ball field than it was to be at home\n[laughter] and maybe they're probably they're being yeah yeah she go see a movie\nThat might be a good segue to have Darwin cycle analyze that I like the people in the news stories not just report the news but also a orange or analysis of their psychology\nGood site if a sure\nI could be a patient as easy as that could be someone giving it by so I'm not so sure that's a good idea\nYeah look at and we all I mean we're graded giving advice and not so great at at taking it and that kind of right mirror I uh\nBut you know

scuffle with an alligator\nBunny is definitely a lucky dog she managed to get away with only minor injuries and a survival tail unlike any other\nFor the most part bunnies seems like your average seven year old Labrador Retriever she loves being outside rolling in the grass and most of all swimming in flight creek behind her family's for hope home the bunny bear scars from a fight few other dogs can match a battle with nearly ten foot alligator\nVery lucky obviously that it was a more shocked a and used to being the aggressor not used to being attacked by a Labrador\nCan't brewer bunnies owner says she was home alone last Thursday when a family friend came by to let her out to play money ran right to the water for one of her favorite hobbies charging in dragging logs three times or size from the creek only this time her target wasn't really a log\nOh she swam full bore towards the gator opened his mouth as a warning and she collided with a directly a went under twice came up from fifty yards back to the dog\nMoney made it to shore with several gashes from the alligators clause in a scratch on her face but otherwise she was okay that's where the gator brewer says it was later removed by wildlife officials\n... the best guess is that they're not used to be attacked and uh it put the gate and defensive mode and it never turn to charge Barney and just swim away\nAlligators are very common threw out our area but brewer says they don't often see large ones in flight creek he's just got this one didn't take a member of his family\nIt's a scary thing to

away from the creek until bunnies expected to make a full recovery in ... county I'm Corey tip and NBC Fifteen\nAren't so Bonnie something about a bunny actually initiating the contact cause the
