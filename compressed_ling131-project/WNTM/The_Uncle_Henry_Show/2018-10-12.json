{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "Is the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal\nThat's why how he won he picked off the far right\nAnd and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult if the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after Hurricane Maria\nNo civil unrest these people just aren't like that they're not as polarized down here in the U.S we are polarized this cabinet shop thing it was just pure partisan\nYou know the Republicans bully Tim and the Democrats believe for the men believed him don't women ... I've never I mean it this there was no common sense no rationality it was just\nPolitical partisanship and the people the Republicans hated the Democrats for attacking this guy and the Democrats hated the Republicans for defending him in and installing this thing and cutting I mean this is like\nI mean and and and who's got all the guns in the world we do so so this is really\nI think that that social unrest and this downturn\nIs going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and do all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this\nThat we really and and and I really think there's a possibility that there's going to be movements in this time or in the civil war I compare there's more to the civil war on the social political level at that time the south seceded from the more industrial and urbanized north they were totally different I mean the north was blue\nThe south has read this time\nEspecially with Republicans in charge now I think there's going to be facts I think states like California or the whole west coast\nOr the whole northeast is going to threaten to succeed plumb the red states because they can't agree on anything there's nothing that can be agreed on his cabinet shop thing was the perfect example of that no middle ground\nIt's either red or blue you know\nHis argument in its argument in hatred and ... on both sides\nAnd and even you know the Democrats are always the nice guy I Know that Democrats are jumping up and down and women you know almost assaulting you know ... senators and in the elevator and stop this ... every body yeah there's a very high tensions and\nI tell you I don't feel that here and it's another advantage to being Puerto Rican I'm kind of like watching on the sidelines to see what happens and then\nIf I Do decide to move back to Florida where I'd probably move 'em\nBack to 'cause we're familiar there and know everybody you know I I Will do it when I can buy a condo there for a quarter of the price [laughter] and and and and and but I Want to see what happens first and and the thing about that that the next year also George's this is this is when it's gonna\nYou know it's going to happen or not it it's either starting to happen now or or the latest by my calculations with every cycle we have an everything we got her as well\nIt's going to start by late next year and that's going to be a Ninety year anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we cover in zero our\nIn our news letters than Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes\nAnd this has happened every Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boom and global\nHis lawn you know here you have had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things\nWere going to happen back last September a news one the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the meat\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position and we were coming into a\nTwo thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally time and then Trump got elected I mean we turn boys I mean when Trump had that surprise when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to ... eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look\nThis is a river so this is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that um and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but\nIt's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses it as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest\nAnd that's not going to win reelection I was just going to even\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and Trump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or best\nTrump polls on and no disaster we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting pass\nNext to the end of next year but there there's a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you

N. T. I'm color miss Betty\nA head cold and a few months ago saying that she was worried about Kanye West ever since his mother died that said that he had some kind of mental health issues\nI'm\nAgain I'm not criticizing Kanye West's politics but sometimes the way he chooses to express themselves\n\nCan be so unconventional it comes off as kind of like lunacy like somebody just raving in ... square to a crowd of squirrels\nBut the reaction has been that's been even more interesting than what actually happened because you've got a segment of the population that thinks that is absolutely horrible\nThe ... should as an African American a celebrity of great influence he should've never gotten together with Trump but he's gotten a lot of\nFlak from people on the left wing that feel like it's terrible um\nI don't I don't really care about the politics aspect of it I just hope the guys okay ... okay you can certainly afford the best care but I just hope the guys okay because he he comes off\nUm\nHe comes off as somebody that if he were to come if he would've go back to the White House next week in say exactly the opposite I wouldn't be surprised by it\nDoes that make sense\nWill be getting into it later on I think bills in for them to be seen as ready as going to call in and help us round up the all the reaction but a ... not helping it was not good for his career to do what he did\nUm\nBut who knows if there is an issue he brought up that the president agrees with maybe they'll maybe something will happen positive out of that visit yesterday All right we're just about at a time in this hour of Gulf Coast mornings coming up things get dramatically news ear\n[noise] Kelly Bennett\nWill bring her news grab it tough to the conversation\nThat's coming up\nBut after the news break here thank you for listening\nTo Gulf Coast ...

the mayor's administration and the city council I'll tell you that the reason that spokespeople are important is because of\nOver a year ago mobile started to improve infrastructure paved streets things like that in a way that they hadn't done it over Twenty years\nAnd I think the city council got a little irritated that the mayor was getting credit for it\nAnd so they started issuing a lot of their own press releases to remind citizens that they were involved too and it's it's it's gotten into that kind of a situation where you had often press releases from both the mayor and the couch she'll competing against each other so I don't know where this is going to end up yeah I don't know where it's going to end up but it looks like there are\nSo as the city spokesperson she's stuck in the middle of all this because she's trying to represent all of them\nWas she was the council's spokesperson ...\nNow okay this city has hacked the has a separate\nSpokesperson\nI don't think I've

W. B. U. V. in Biloxi news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the jag immobile where news headlines coming\nUp in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent bills for Bill good morning\nGood morning I'll go and read them on and Kelly showing Kanye West meeting President Trump I knew it was going to\nBe out of the ordinary but I really did not expect how out of the ordinary it turned out to be\n[noise] yeah I don't think anybody did uncle Henry and now this was a good idea that the president had get together\nA group of uh representatives from the African American community to talk about policy policy issues like prison reform and and violence in inner cities and specifically Chicago maybe gang influences on young people and things like that pretty good idea\nBut today after this and and Kanye West so it's almost like a stand up routine during the meeting um there's one question that people are asking but I still haven't\nHeard an answer to and it is what was that\nI uh I mean we really are\nTrying to figure out exactly what happened here I mean Kanye West talked about everything from alternate universes through the thirteenth amendment which I got rid of slavery to hydrogen aircraft to the second amendment to comparing his comments to wind to hugging the president and yes\nThe dropping the F bomb in the oval office uh so uh ... you know what I compare this to all go Henry and and uh I I Know you'll understand this and you probably will to Kelly I think he's like the uh the enigma machine that the Germans used during world\nWar two you know there's a message in there somewhere but you got it was hard to find it wow\nOkay [laughter] uh well let me ask you this what he was not alone in this meeting with President Trump there were other people there\nYeah a jump around the NFL legend\nIt was a sitting there as well as some other uh representatives too and one was an attorney we didn't hear them speak at all Jim Brown spoke a little bit but the Kanye West dominated the whole time\nNow I have noticed some of the record snow ... you'll hear a brief clip and it sounds pretty coherent and in might even be something that you agree with from a policy standpoint but as you pointed out if you listen to the whole thing\nOr it's it's almost like you might want to worry about Kanye that he's okay\nWell hey that's one of the reactions coming out today um I'll go Henry is a concern for Conyers of course he was hospitalized in twenty sixteen for what was described as a temporary psychosis and later diagnosed with bipolar disorder ah and ah but he'd\nYesterday during this thing in the White House said that it was sleep deprivation and not a bipolar or so for that reason he has discontinued any kind of medical regimen for that and those close to him are concerned about this\nOr that they say that they should be back on his regular medical regimen or that he has abandoned and and for that reason there was concern about Kanye also ah some criticism coming out of course for the president that\nUh he allowed this to continue on at the same time that uh we had a the wall by you know the ... going down another five hundred points and we're seeing all the scenes of devastation from Florida and the death toll rising and we have a serious foreign policy issue developing with Saudi Arabia\nBut yet the president allowed ... to go on his rent for about Fifteen minutes\nWhat about fallout for Kanye sorry Kelly Bennett\nYeah we're getting a lot of reaction are you know there has been some positive reaction to this saying that uh that it was it was great for the president to do this and Kanye West is yeah he's a character but he does bring up some important issues but then you have others like another rapper TI you know I'm not familiar with them but\nApparently a colleague of ... called it repulsive and disgraceful and embarrassing\nAxle rose from gums and roses actually\nA responded calling it a joke\nOr Don Lemon the CNN commentator said he called it a minstrel show so it really uh most of the reaction we see was very critical of of of ... performance will say during this meeting\nYou've got to wonder if the president\nThinking to themselves that you know he's going to touch on some important topics with some\nInfluential people like ... but ... is such a loose screw I mean I think most of us remember him most\nFrom the uh American music awards I thought it was where Taylor Swift was getting an award and he came up and interrupted and said beyond say deserved it yeah I I Wonder if he's got a mental issue or if he's just an attention seekers and he does this kind of thing on purpose\nI think it's a little of both actually you know a boy this diagnosis or a couple of years ago\nA perhaps a some type of a mental disorder or medical disorder Andy yeah see of course he's attention seeking he's a he's a celebrity he's a he's a an entertainer of course he has attention seeking so I think it's a combination of both I\nCan't believe he really is I'm Sorry I'm Glad he's taken a lot of grief for his supported President Trump that which I think is really interesting and here's why\nBecause we are so politically divided in this country right now that you can't talk politics it's ... without an argument\nFor look we're at a time we could\nOnce you've got ... million axle rose we could talk for hours [laughter] [laughter] but we don't have time yeah\n... thank you for your time have a great weekend you to ... and Kelly Bennett and I will be
