W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine to five FM the dragon mobiles and news talk one oh four nine WB you'd be in Biloxi\nWe have news headlines coming up in about ... ...\nAnd that's before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent bills in for Bill good morning\nYour morning uncle and aunt and Kelly\nSo tell us where is Mike Pompeo going\n[noise] uh this will be a whirlwind trip to the far east I'm not a lot of time for sightseeing here because he will start off in Tokyo or tomorrow into Sunday then moved to North Korea on Sunday down to South Korea Sunday and Monday and he'll cap it off with a stop in Beijing on Monday\nWow okay so yeah that's that's a lot so what what does he hoped to accomplish with the strip\nWell you know what this initially was seen as a trip to North Korea\nOr to meet with Kim Jong on and to lay out the framework for another summit between the Kim Jong un and President Trump and also talk about that ever elusive denuclearization issue but at this really has turned in I think has turned into a whole different trip\nUh his stop in Beijing on Monday should be particularly interesting uh right now the state department is only saying that he will meet with\nQuote Chinese officials ah he's not going to meet with President Xi and now there's a question whether he will even get to meet with any senior Chinese officials because\nOf the United states of course has a pretty long list of grievances now against China ranging from trade all the way down to illegal drugs to hacking into election meddling to a military activities in the south China Sea\nAnd then yesterday Mike Pence drop the hammer delivering just or a blistering speech at a think tank in Washington regarding China he said that what Russia's doing\nPales in comparison to what China's doing and we know that Russia has meddled in our elections are everybody in the world agrees that Russia\nPoison that that's by in a in a Great Britain or we just had some Russians indicted yesterday by the U.S department of justice so he's saying that that pales in comparison to what China is doing China has said this is ridiculous\nAnd that so that makes my palm pale stop in Beijing all the more interesting\nSo and I think you pointed out earlier this week didn't you build them for that that we're getting along better now with North Korea than we are with China\n[noise] well I I think I uh I pointed out that or or speculated that we may be getting along better with North Korea than we are with Canada right\nNow oh yeah that's right okay well I'm ... so how does um you said that he's also going to Tokyo how does that factor in\nWell he will stop their first he'll meet with prime minister Shinzo Abe's and their foreign minister or there'll be talking number one about about North Korea Japan still has some issues they would like to get resolved with North Korea\nUh and they feel the best way to do this may be with us help and a particular interest that Japan has an issue with North Korea\nReportedly allegedly abducted Japanese citizens decades ago some of whom are still there\nAre so they would like to clear up this issue once and for all with North Korea and also my palm pale we'll talk some trade issues with Japan as well we're about to enter into trade negotiations with Japan\nWow so this is a this is quite the trip or when you add all of the new stuff with China\nIt really is an end in a in a short amount of time I mean there's not going to be a whole lot of partying going on here\nOkay well you know I wasn't sure about Mike Pompeo in his ... his propensity to party\n[laughter] I yeah I I don't think he's a party or but uh there's not going to be much time you'd if he was\nOkay so um I guess we have to that this is an additional thing to watch over the weekend along with the ...\nYeah uh and I wonder Mike Pompeo's disappointed about getting out of Washington for
