I'm Ninety nine five FM the drag\nImmobile coming up here in a little less than Fifteen minutes we're going to talk to bills for NBC News radio national correspondent about the Margaret Sarah band that continues to head toward the U.S border before we get to that\nWe have a story about bully bullying this was out of Moby all over the weekend a there was a teenager named Laura that went to the homecoming dance at Murphy high school in mobile\nAnd people started making fun of the way she looked at the homecoming dance her hair her dress or everything about her and she ran out of the homecoming dance after just forty five minutes I'm now and then it went on the line\nAnd she was there were there were nasty things apparently set about her online because that's that's how these things work in in modern times so I'm sure as the mom her mother went online to defend her daughter here is Laura's mother Odessa ...\nDaughter was beautiful she will follow that she was a princess and these these guys to something beautiful moment meaning for me and her and made it\nSo as a result of all this attention online about it and the post for my mother\nSeveral local businesses jumped up and decided to make the young woman feel better so she got she got like a make over\nA God he's got her pictures made all this kind of stuff in fact the Murphy homecoming court went to one of her photo shoots to include her\nAnd just be with her and show some ... solidarity weather here is Laura the girl that was bullied\nHad caught us [noise]\nAnd make them feel comfortable and I think one of many people out there [noise] they ... they ...\nSo she and ... and ... or their salon owners makeup artist nail technicians have offered free services for free services to help Laura get ready for another homecoming because Macintosh high school in Alabama heard about this and they've invited lure to come to their home coming\nSo that she can have another bullying free homecoming dance well\nI think that's great but I think we shouldn't have to have people coming in to rescue somebody that's been bullied well not rescue but you know to help make them feel better help 'em out of a terrorist situation like this ... you know it boggles my mind you hear about bullying so much in the news and I\nKnow it's something that they bring up in school it shouldn't even be happening in the first place so\nThat the fact that it did\n... I just don't understand I don't understand I agree it's still happening I now I I\nAgree with you I mean we hear we hear so many public service announcements about bullying these days it is isn't it amazing that it has happened at this point\nYou almost wonder if we give it so much attention that you make it happen more I don't know\nIt's [noise]\nWell [noise] but you know it's something we've all that I dealt with it when I was in school\nRight hey we'll be right back with more sulfur ...\nTimes bigger traffic [noise] the closure of the intersection or dolphin and Florida immobile was supposed to win today however the\n\nOf the Gulf mornings with Kelly men at an uncle Henry where on news Sox won ... seats and news radio seven ... and Ninety nine five ... mobiles\nWeb news headlines coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent bills in for building morning\nAnd go Henry good morning I'm On a Kelly\nSo the migrant Arab man how much is a grown\nWell there are some estimates now that goes highest ten thousand a year remember this started off as about a hundred fifty people in a Honduras and has steadily grown in with other people joining in and all the publicity that this has gotten a ... is helping this\nAh but now you know the estimates are as high as ten thousand people are involved in this caravan which is in southern Mexico the big bulk of it anyway after we all saw the\nImages over the weekend of people gathered on that bridge between Guatemala and Mexico ah they were waiting there to be processed and got impatient some ended up swimming across the river being drafted across the river others just pushed down the fence and scream through so we do have this group in southern Mexico now\nSo what's the latest and could they actually make it to the U.S border\n[noise] still a long way to go there a Kelly over a thousand miles remain to be covered by this group so still a long way to go and Mexico continues to try to tell these people are look I come to the processing center we will grant you asylum\nAnd and we'll go from there in fact they have started placing buses now along this route because we're also seeing other suffering among the people we've seen children suffering effects of the heat or that they have encountered and the elderly with it might have some health issues or others\nAre are are beginning to feel the pressure here uh physically up this track so what Mexico has done has started placing buses along the route\nAnd telling the people look anytime you're ready to jump on the bus will take you over the to the processing center you will be granted asylum in Mexico a dust far a lot of people have been unwilling to do that fearing that it will only result in them being sent back to their home country so\nUh will they make it to the United states they got a long way to go\n\nSit in the meantime you talk about how many thousands of people this has now become and you know they're being offered asylum in Mexico but I'm kind of curious as to the conditions that they're under\nWhat kind of a relief efforts are underway or their groups and they're kind of helping them out making sure that their fat or they have water how's that situation being worked out\nWell you know we don't have any reports of organized effort by humanitarian groups but what we do a report solve is a tremendous gestures by the locals are along the route here\nWho have gone out to meet this caravan or in some cases giving them everything from ... from a water to a shoes\nTo money in a you know there are some cases of people handing out their own money to some of these people to give them a little bit of cash on the way through so\nAh there have been a lot of gestures whether they're organized humanitarian effort so we haven't heard of groups that are involved in that but I'm sure they will be a just because of all the publicity that has been generated by this caravan a show\nOr a but the conditions continue to be bad\nSo what are we going to do if they get here yeah that's a that's the magic\nQuestionnaire uncle Henry the president has talked about uh putting our military down at the border\nOr if they do make it to the United states okay even if we have our military there what do you do I mean you can't have a violent response to what these people are doing you could\nWe have an arrangement with Mexico now where we can just turn them away we don't have to put them into the process if their request asylum we can just turn them away but then what happens do they set up migrant camps along the border hoping to get across any way they can even if it's the illegally uh so that that remains the big question here\nBut in the past these groups that I've started off in Central America and have to have the trek through Mexico have really dwindled as they are the farther north they get\nAh so I Would imagine that we're going to see a smaller much smaller number that has gathered now if and when they get to the United states and truthfully now a what a Honduras Guatemala what Mexico I've been unable to do Mother Nature may be able to do because we've got a hurricane\nThat is ready to hit western Mexico could be a category five hurricane\nOr it is north of where this caravan is but still a what effects they will encounter a as they move north remains to be seen and and could cause problems for them\nWhich so so bills him for the [noise] you may not know the answer to this question but I'm going to ask it any way no how this number of of up to ten thousand how does that compare to what normally we have\nCrossing the border because I keep hearing reports that some spots have four thousand apprehensions a week\nYeah uh well the numbers from a September alone were\nPretty impressive ah for the month of September there were forty thousand people are detained at the border as illegal immigrants uh so uh I mean that that the numbers are pretty big\nAh so you know even though this ten thousand people is really a drop in the bucket when you look at the whole the picture altogether but just the fact that these guys are coming from all the way from Central America\nIs what is really drawing attention builds up for thank you for your time today You're

[noise] yeah you\nGuys have been chatting this morning already I Know we have a waiting to speak this morning about the uh Murphy high school student in mobile who was bullied online for her homecoming the way she look yeah they all heard about this\nWe absolutely have in fact um I Know what I Know is that she went to the homecoming dance at Murphy her name was Laura that she left the ... after forty five minutes apparently people were mean to hurt him to dance so did they also bully her online Darwin\nApparently they did a there'd been some terrible things said about our main show for it you know how they'll post these things because they really\nHave no self confidence in themselves it's so much easier to do it on line you know but apparently she did face some of it ... where she got to the dance the interesting thing is um I was we were looking at the video up her today and and beauty first of all is it\nJust bought your face and body look like it's much deeper than that and I think most of us realize that ... ... what what Kelly and I look at the pictures of her I said well she is a beautiful girl in and kill it so that's probably why she got tormented\nTime minute timeout here helped me understand that because I had the same reaction I was telling Kelly minute about this this morning that when I saw her on thought how could how could this have happened I mean she just has a beautiful person\nWell she she she is lovely I don't know her personally but apparently this really got Jordan hurt her deeply a bet she I I don't know either I don't know Kelly said that and to me it it meant that some people are jealous I guess that's the impression\nI getting you think that's ... exactly yes I think that's exactly what Kelly meant and I think it out and people\nYeah you know it's unfortunate but I think that does happen\nAnd you know what's it like to me is that this kind of thing is happening when we have\nAll these anti bullying campaigns and use constantly seem to be spreading the message is you know we need to treated with respect and you know you talked about how people your beauty is ...\nNot just what you see on the outside it this kind of story makes you feel like that message is just not getting through to anybody but\nWell first of all listen to how much it hurts identical here we have some sound from a from the mother\nOr your daughter and why and how it makes them feel right well here is that what the mama had to say\nMy daughter was beautiful she thought she was a princess and these these guys said something beautiful moment meaningful for me and her and made it old\nAnd she she mentioned that the that the girl was talking about how she wanted to take her life she was crying all the way home and ... and that's how bad she mailed a but the reason we're talking about this on the air with Darwin is because people heard about it online and local business people jumped into try and make her feel better\nAnd I'm thinking Kelly or saying or what's happened to the compassion are we getting through with these messages you know I I think we are not maybe to every student but to\nThe community saying this is unacceptable because now belt to step forward their salon owners to make people or nail technicians are offered to help her get ready for\nHer next big day which is coming up the the Macintosh high school which is just north of ... county [noise] they they have invited her to their problems so she is going to get the royal treatment because people in the community of heard about her story and they're saying this is not acceptable so\nYeah it is getting through to mourn or people maybe we start to work to do on campuses but\nAs the community as a whole\nOr if we're starting their and setting an example for children than we are making some progress you may be talking to ourselves but that trickles down hopefully\nAnd uh and we're really glad that the community saying this is not
