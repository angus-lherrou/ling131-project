{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "Like on my news website over a coast to coast amateur take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical but the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation which is is some of the layers\nHave a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a ... view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the reviewer or who was it was very well known or ... or drop your who don't we reviewed my paper\nOr he calls the waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by plane as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these are you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not supposed to interpret it what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ten\nA originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed\nThere was a they say there was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top and the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researcher who was proposed this is Robert ... brother John Paul will go out\nAnd the papers on I think it's on a Robert ... vaults or\nAcademia a page and it's also in cause me gloom ah his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and now of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the uh repeating of the sticker layers\n[noise] um\nIs it every ten steps that every ... there's some kind of ... you\nKnow I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck about when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nUm because you know you would you could just you know simple in mind that I thought each step they were just a applied the ah the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed their parents with uh something called they call it the set that which is the pyramid angle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward\nAnd that's holiday conceptualize a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's low regularity even to fat thickness and so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nWe'll get to that uh after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there\nA couple of dozen that earth decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides\nYeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I think I said that uh belong to a shot a shock to ... and ... ... ... was disappearing uh during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't a kid in the paper it was a star ... so it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country\nBecause of that because that constellation ... what was so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the paper and we took care of it ended up in that in the north south orientation\nI gotta jump in right there the ... coast to coast and we've got to take a break my new this is ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] get\nDaily Show updates rate your

T. S. D. and keep people off those stronger opiates which had become such an epidemic\nIn our country so it'll be interesting it will be what happens with this yeah um I it I\nI just hope that there are a lot there's a lot more research on the medical benefits it's it's something that I think there wasn't much research on the medical benefits of marijuana because it was treated by the federal government has a really hard drug\nSometimes almost of treated the same way as as you treat heroin or LSD or something like that or we may have missed out on some of some actual medical benefits for people and it would be great to find some medical benefits to this\nI agree yeah and whatever we can do to try to help solve this there'll be a problem I mean I think it's beyond time to do that I mean when we continue to see stories about opiate issues and I especially like I said the huge military population we've got to hear on the coast and\nUh it just people that are dealing with the tea as to be maybe other issues of trauma and that kind of think of it can help them out I'd love to see this avenue open up to [noise]\nAll right so we'll continue to follow that that'll be on the ballot possibly in Mississippi and twenty twenty [noise]\nPart we have some words for our sponsors trafficking whether together every ten minutes on the knowledge and then ride back with more Gulf Coast ...

N. T. M. and Ninety nine five at the end the Jack and mobiles\nRevenue shut lines coming up in about ten minutes from Fox and from NBC Fifteen\nOr in other news sources here on the Gulf Coast mornings before we get your news headlines we want to welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings Michael by our NBC News radio national correspondent Michael good morning\nOwning a glittering morning Kelly Abby Monday\nI Know you you too I Know President Trump was on sixty minutes last night\nWe have time we'd like to get to that but I'm curious about complaints about FEMA and hurricane Michael Kelly minute and I have been through several hurricanes here on the Gulf Coast and I think people tend to always have complaints about FEMA\n[laughter] I I think there's actually wallets unwritten for the most part guys I think there's rules that even FEMA abides by what they know that X amount of days into a calendar after a hurricane is drug that's one of the complaints are going to be you know I think they have that kind of clarity here as well so I don't think this is unexpected but I Do think there's a certain part of this\n... when you have the storm the size of hurricane Michael ... grew as it impacted the Florida Panhandle and exactly what it did to the Florida Panhandle I think now we're starting to see some elements of a little bit more concern in regards to FEMA's abilities and and what they are and are not doing so in some cases where Singh reports over the weekend journalists have been out\nSpeaking with people in Panama City speaking with people in Mexico beach and I have found in regards as an example one story a barber Sanders hunkering down with her daughter in an apartment in Panama City\nThat apartment complex badly damaged but Sanders told reporters not a single relief agency has come by to check on them not one group of organs organization has come by to check on them and all that so they're not getting any help they need food and water it's just crazy now\nNot to say that they didn't prepare or not have X amount of days of food and water on hand but again this storm\nA much stronger when it hit land than most people were expecting certainly than they would have had time to prepare for two days in advance so um they're out of water now they're out of food and they're looking for help and there are no FEMA trucks making their way around dropping off any food or water so a block long administrator for FEMA\nA out of a statement yesterday saying that the system is working their system is working but it takes time when you see devastation like that and he said we have to set all the citizens expectations saying that they have twenty three distribution points where residents could get food water and other essentials\nBut it seems guys that probably one of the bigger problems here because Michael was so strong when it came in and did so much destruction certainly any areas still without electricity and at best spotty cell service\nThe information is not getting to the people who need it the most right now they're not getting the information of these twenty three different places where you could go and get food and water nor do they necessarily have a car that may have been washed away with the flooding that went on to be able to get them to one of these twenty three distribution centers and then the case of the woman I was speaking of earlier ms Sanders\nAnd she said the only way that they were able to get water was there was a a group of people a truckload of people\nAre from Louisiana that happened to pack a bunch of water in the waters of bottles of water in the back of their Ford F. one fifty or driving around looking for people dropping off water that way\nAnd the question then is why isn't FEMA doing something like that\nOkay well this is um I as we started the conversation I'm Kelly better you're not surprised or you I mean this is this is ... after every storm like this there are criticisms of FEMA\nYeah and I think it's unfortunate but with the cell towers down in power down I think you're going to see this kind of situation exactly\nAs Michael power explains you know people that just aren't aware of where to go to get it\nOr that there may be help close by there are just not even aware and you know female even admitted look you know there are some areas where we we just we're having trouble getting in there right now it's going to take some time they were talking about food drops this morning\nSo I'm a ... it's it's a rough situation for everybody involved in this thing you know like you said it got strong so fast\nAnd it's a situation where a few days hurricanes supplies is gonna run out on you yeah if you're in a really hard hit areas\nAnd that seems to be as as you mentioned there you know

rode roads are literally crumbling um those kinds of issues and safety getting people to that area which is why as you also mentioned according to governor Rick Scott they were going to start deploying some air dropping of food and water\nAnd some of the hardest hit areas but that still kind of this information\nNot being able to be exchanged between FEMA and the people who don't have power electricity that should be something that you would think\nOn any normal level any hurricane well there was a category one or a category five they'd be able to remedy that on some level how do they get that information out to the people that should be one of the more important things that they're doing\nIn these communities are they're going to visit and if you have people who can't get there because their cars were washed away then how do you get that food and water that you've been preparing and talking about your preparation for\nHow you get that to them before it's either too late or in the case of what some of these people are saying is listen you're going to have residents in the area where people from Louisiana helping and bringing food and water until FEMA can get in

news headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC fifteens Darwin singleton dorm and good morning\nGood morning to both of you know this Monday\nI've noticed a at NBC Fifteen you've been doing lots of great coverage of the recovery efforts after hurricane Michael\nJoined together with our our sister station W E A R Pensacola and that allows us to have a lot more coverage potential in fact er we shared our since we weren't in the eye of the strongest shared a lot of our reporters and staff with\nWith them to help them be staffed enough ah to extend their coverage because this you know this is a big storm it was yeah it was it was something where we're not used to that kind of thing every day here but I'm the president is going to be and landing at Eglin today can't land that just because it's all screwed up\nA Faisal and an egg one today and get a first look and I I really from my experience with Katrina and and I have a new really\nI think you understand what people were going through but until you\nPut your feet on the sand or\nThen it really hit the scope of the problem and so it's always good that uh our leaders go and see in person\nBecause they don't have some ambiguous picture in their head they really need to see for themselves so he'll be landing there this this morning a will be giving coverage that will be going live when he does make his landing if he has a comments today so we'll be carrying that\nNow don't you know I Know I'm Sorry Kelly apologies\nI'm thinking about the evacuations today because I Would think that a lot of them\nAre either thought about going home over the weekend or went ahead and tried to see if they could get home\nUm and you know this situation it kinda complicates things when the evacuated started going back because they haven't had time to remove debris to clear roadways so I Know a lot of people were running into some road blocks in that regard what have you heard\nWell there you know of course they're breaking down those road blocks but there's bridges that are out I was talking to make a Ghana and you know we talked last week one of our reporters here and and she's from a\nPort saint Joe which was really heavily damaged by the storm and she says you know there's basically one road leading in and out for the most part is the beach wrote\nAnd it's in the forgotten kosher says because of these towns are isolated that tunnel air force base and everything over there that keeps below that property occupied [noise] and she says when that rages out she pointed a bridge that she says well that means we can't get in that way\nAnd then there's another based on the other side of town that stats damage so it you know the rose by me cleared up there's going to have to be some construction I Know for that has really accelerated they put up a pretty big challenges to\n... and and to themselves to get this excess quickly as possible so that will change but really you need to be in a place where you're comfortable and just sit by the side of the road trip a wedding ... things to clear it give yourself a little more time that's not going anywhere\n[noise] uh but we did have something uh uh that has to be concerned and\nWe've been talking about in the air this morning Mexico beach was just about washed off the map\nAnd you've probably seen aerial pictures of it it's just that reminds me of um go port a ... year in Katrina mostly go court [noise] and they've had a the mayor said about two hundred and fifty chose to write out the storm\nThey've not been able to find all of them they there's forty six people they can't account for right now\n[noise] thirty ... thirty five but I saw a report where the the police chief said forty six [noise] uh I'm afraid that's going to be a tragedy that unfolds there I Do hope they find everybody okay and it is hard to locate everybody but after two or three days in the storm somehow\nIf you're alive rebel let your family no cars you know how sick they are\nNow worried they are so I'm worried that we may have yet to really get the whole human tragedy out of Mexico beach\n[noise]\nYeah I I Do remember you know you're talking about the challenges they have a had a when our bridges went out after Katrina and it it creates a situation where it takes longer to get places which at that point you're just glad to be getting anywhere so that's okay with you but\nI I tell you it was a modern marble to me to see how quickly they rebuilt the bay St Louis bridge and that's something I've never forgotten\nWell ... yeah when when they face these kinds of challenges it's amazing that kind of results you can get\nAt well we know over here or do we all go Henry that if if we had been depending on the Cochrane bridge for our livelihood [laughter] it took forever to build that bridge immobile\nYeah absolutely you know\nDid but we weren't you know we hadn't had a disaster it was just a I don't think we lost a contractor and it was but yeah those bridges are our allies lunch when we're here on the coast in our communities are so separated by water it's it's the beauty of the coast but it's also\nA it's also a\nProblem whenever you have a storm like this because your lifeline your your communities or or isolated\n[noise] um and uh you know there's some island

M. and Ninety nine five that than the jak immobile now we have\nA story about a mayor on the Mississippi Gulf Coast who is advocating for legalized medical marijuana I'm really interested in this and that\nAnd I'm curious about what the attitude is like in Mississippi Kelly been and I know that in Alabama oh well I'm I'm convinced the Alabama will be the last state\nTo ever allow anything like that to occur that it'll happen everywhere else before it happens in Alabama in fact in Alabama or we I think we were the last state that allowed home brewing\nOf beer\nAnd really and it was only a few years ago that we were allowed to purchase beers larger than ... ounces in convenience stores because our state legislature tourist spots that any beer over twelve ounces would be too much\nBut you just couldn't handle it\nSo I'm the mayor and now the mayor of ... ocean springs I'm he feels like this is something that will help veterans right\nHe himself has dealt with ... so he says he knows medical marijuana is a good alternative\nFor treating the symptoms of the disorder is actually edited bent over the weekend at the Keith cultural center helping to collect signatures for a medical marijuana twenty twenty campaign this is thinking voter approval for a constitutional amendment toward legalizing medical marijuana in our state\nThat's something that's already been done in Louisiana now he's been very open about his support for the legalization of medical marijuana but he says he does not support legalizing recreational marijuana\nAnd I think Mississippians most of them if you didn't ask them a few years ago about marijuana and and the legalization of it they just said no we don't need to do that I think though with the huge military population that we have here on the coast\nPeople are kind of opening up to the idea because it's been proven that it can help treat P. T. S. D. and keep people off those stronger opiates which had become such an epidemic in our country so it\nYeah interesting it will be what happens with this yeah um I it I\nI just hope that there are a lot there's a lot more research on the medical benefits it's it's something that I think there wasn't much research on the medical benefits of marijuana because it was treated by the federal government as a really hard drug sometimes almost of treated the same way as as you treat heroin or LSD or something like that\nOr we may have missed out on some of some actual medical benefits for people and it would be great to find some medical benefits to this\nI agree yeah and whatever we can do to try to help solve this there'll be a problem I mean I think it's beyond time to do that I mean when we continue to see stories about opiate issues and I especially like I said the huge military population we've got to hear on the coast and\nUh it just people that are dealing with the tea STD maybe other issues of trauma and that\nKind of thing and they can help them out I'd love to see this avenue open up to them All right so we'll continue to follow that that'll be on the ballot possibly in Mississippi and twenty twenty [noise]\nPart we have some words for our sponsors traffic and whether together every ten minutes on the knowledge and then ride back with more Gulf Coast more than ...
