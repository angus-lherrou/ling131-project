{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "And so it seems to me that there has been a space force all ready for a long time and that space force serve the dual purpose I mean it can make a the defense of earth against other earthlings\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them that are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do what ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving\nUs better to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are beings out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um\nThey they ... you know would otherwise destroy is ah if you know if if that was their plan but on you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a theorists talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel um if they they come back and they want to enslave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here and in ... it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide in other words\nAnd again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back and put you know callers on us\nAnd and work like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan I'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made\nA one of his speeches I Believe it might've been before the un you know what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nWhat did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to raw as well and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep [noise]\nI mean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders\nBut there may be some some are being\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against and they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do\nAnd so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps presenting that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the the earthlings have run with it and so we need to put them back in their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah thank you it's it's this Saturday it's October the thirteenth this is going

the weekend's events with the swearing in of judge Kavanaugh before we get to that though we do have weather in that some listeners of this show or under a tropical storm watch\nYes and I'm going to try to get to all bad let's see we've got a coastal flooding advisory in effect in Mississippi that's until tomorrow night we've got a hurricane watching effect for the Alabama Florida border\nOr the hurricane watch means hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area that's typically issued forty eight hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical storm force winds conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous\nAnd we've got a tropical storm watch NFL fact ah for the Alabama Florida border to the Mississippi Alabama border so\nWhat we're looking at right now a tropical storm Michael is making its way toward the Gulf Coast and John ... for the national Hurricane Center explains that Michael will only get stronger as it moves\nThe latest forecast for Michael hasn't moving generally northward a and then maybe northeast heard of the heads up into the north central and north eastern Gulf of Mexico and then likely moving inland a late Wednesday Wednesday\nNight time period is the current thinking as a hurricane in fact we think Michael has an opportunity to strengthen quite significantly\nNow Michael is headed toward the Florida Panhandle is what forecasters are saying this storm is expected to become a hurricane later today and strengthen to a strong category to storm before it makes landfall on Wednesday and then it will weaken as it moves out of the U.S\nBiggest impact will certainly be along the Gulf Coast where it's going to be the strongest uh after it crosses the Gulf Coast will get through the Florida Gulf Coast it'll then track likely northeast where it across the southeast us\nStates as a much weaker system and then exit off of the Carolinas ...\nRight now maximum sustained winds are at Seventy miles per hour that's up to four AM update and we'll have another update coming out at seven this morning we'll let you know what happens there\nYou are an heard the phrase exit out of the Carolinas\nWhich yeah that didn't Mm that's going to be rough on them because they're still dealing with flooding\nBut no doubt about it so uh this is a job and what isn't it a year ago that we were we were dealing with similar

W. N. T. M. Ninety nine to five at them the jagged immobile with the news headlines coming up in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines when a welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent Michael ... Michael good morning\nOr good morning or good morning Kelly how are you this morning doing\nGreat I'm very curious about Kavanaugh and will he will actually be an effort to impeach him because I Can't remember somebody trying to impeach the Supreme Court justice before\nI Would say uncle and killing the effort is there now whether it's successful or not we don't know at this point but we know that even prior to his swearing in and frankly I think maybe prior to to Susan Collins giving her speech on the floor a petition had already begun\nAnd now that petition to impeach Kevin I was gathered over a hundred and twenty five thousand signatures we know that progressive groups are are raising money to raise money to expel him from the federal bench at least one key democratic lawmakers promised to investigate the judge if the party retake the house in November and now the key to that is\nIf the party retake the house in November So all of this on both sides for Democrats and Republicans are going to add up to what happens here in the mid term elections and and this cabinet or\nA appointment and the Kavanaugh swearing in is going to be a giant part of that Republicans hailing not just the swearing in is a watershed moment the Pell their party to the midterms but also\nHighlighting how Democrats are going back to the very beginning\nOf the cabinet confirmation hearings where we saw the protesters and where we saw Democrats interrupting every couple of seconds to complain that they didn't have filed all of that is something that they are going to use all the way up to the very end here\nAnd how they they brought these charges against cabinet that were\nUnheard of and and and and President Trump saying not only should a cabin or be able to get the nomination and get sworn in but also should be able to pursue a Christine Blasey Ford for liable on some level so all of that part of it is going to play into the next four and a half weeks share what we've got mid term elections coming up and he was able to bring more people\nTo the table you know it sounds like what you just send a if if there is a noticeable effort to try in position to impeach him or investigate him that's going to help the Republicans isn't it\nI think it's true I think that's a very good point I Do think that that's the case 'cause it just highlights again with the Democrats are willing to do and I think you even got some some Democrats who are lifelong Democrats who are really concerned about this element of\nThe impeachment part of the more progressive part of of the Democratic party being the ones who are fired up behind this portion of it and I think you've got the the more moderate\nDemocrats going what will will will hold on a second here listen let's get people to the voting booth let's give them a message or something that they can count on instead of just impeach this guy or not that\nGuy when pointing at President Trump and they don't have that as of right now now is it still possible that this is all just sort of a movement to try to win over millennial voters who may be\nYou know in the past certainly haven't come out to the polls to vote and maybe needs some sort of a small reason to do it without getting into the ... the ... version of the political ISI world they just need some sort of something to stand behind perhaps a hash tag like me too that they can do that with\nThat sounds like a good plan but is it going to bring\nThem to the voting polls we don't know and those people that millennials are generally not people who are answering much much of the precursor ripples that we look at it now\nAnd so Michael our what what is that we know the reaction from the the two political parties what about other reaction are we getting reaction from the judicial community itself\nYou will certainly are um we do know that the former dean of the Yale Law school where Kavanaugh education um is calling out\nKevin out confirmation he actually refer to it as an American tragedy and has said that the new Supreme Court justices black robe embodiment of partisan power\nInconsistent with any ideal of an impartial judiciary so and this is what he's saying is that the testimony that judge Kavanaugh gave to the Senate Judiciary committee where he was very defensive um you say that that ended up itself when he called on Democrats when he called out the Clintons when he called up\nEverybody in that fiery speech\nThat is part is that as a part in power and that does not sit well when you're talking about the Supreme Court\nWhere you're supposed to be impartial\nIn regards to the judiciary in the meantime chief justice John Roberts has received more than a dozen judicial misconduct complaints in recent weeks against Brett Kavanaugh most of those centering on the statements that he made during his Senate confirmation hearing so\nThat fiery speech you you saw from him to the Republicans are touting as most importantly his ability to stand up for himself and clear his good name may come back to haunt him here on a judiciary kind of a level where that highlights of partisanship and less of an ability which we know for a fact\nThat the the Supreme Court and more importantly cheap John Roberts the chief justice John Roberts and trying to make sure the courts legitimacy and standing as a neutral arbiter isn't primo spotlight for this is going to challenge I\nWear well Kelly better than I we're hoping that we will be done with this Michael by or I guess we're we're now you me too\nYeah no I was to be though to trust me I was hoping that he's talking about something completely different and cab and all this money but here we are All right Michael ... thank you for your time today you gotta guys have a great rest of your morning\nTheir egos Michael Bell or NBC News radio national correspondent wow Kelly been we could be talking about this for months ...\nSounds like it now that excited I'll just be honest\nWonder about people that signed these petitions and stuff like that if they really feel like it's going to have the outcome that they're hoping that well [noise]\nIt may
