here it's eight three one one eight seven to three and one time saver traffic on ...\n[noise] we continue to try Michael and the Gulf of Mexico that four hundred miles south of Panama City Florida\nNews headlines coming up here in about ten minutes before we get to the news headlines when a welcome back to Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent Michael by our Michael good morning\nOr good morning Oakland or good morning Kelly how are you guys this morning\nWell we're glad glad we're not in the cone\nRight exactly [laughter] that's where you don't want to be right now that's where if you're if you're like oh I Love going a visiting spring break Panama City Florida was the place to go that that's going to be a concern certainly today not only because it's not spring break but also because what according to governor\nRick Scott as say this could be a monster is storm\nThat is going to be bearing down on some three hundred miles of Florida's coastline and I understand\nThat a parts near you guys are going to be getting at least part of the whipping winds and the rains that are going to be coming from this even though it's set to go to Panama City and then from there at least the way it's projected right now hit Panama City in the kind of jet off to the right cutting across a Georgia and then will eventually end up\nThrough the Carolinas and out of the Atlantic ocean up there a but with that\nRight now category one going to go to a category to more than likely and possibly even a category three status between now and tomorrow when it said hit landfall\nYeah I notice that we're on the western side of the hurricane which tends to be a good thing for folks it's the northeast quadrant that has the most dangerous conditions right\n[noise] yeah and they're saying that just about I guess if you're if you're looking at were Panama City is and where the the the storm is planning on going\nJust to the south and maybe a little bit east of that is where they're saying the strongest storm surge is going to beat and that's going to be we're looking at right now again storm surge the deadliest part of these kinds of storms storm surge eight to twelve feet so you're looking at if it gets up to the high end of that well\nThat's twelve feet of water and then waves up on top of that that's over the top of most one story homes on some level so that\nIs going to be dangerous right in that particular area but you are also looking at flooding that's going to occur from the rain and then the when that's going to be happening should carry this thing through not only when it hits landfall around Panama City tomorrow\nBut as it starts to make its way to Georgia you're seeing maybe some sustained winds ended a thirty five forty mile an hour range through Florida and going into South Carolina and those states are still getting over when Florence it\nThey're not too long ago I mean there are still parts of South Carolina have bridges on roads out and now there's a very big possibility that those winds coming through a lot more power out\nBefore it makes its way off into the Atlantic\nYeah that was a big concern uncle Henry and I talked about that yesterday because it looks like this thing was going to act said in the Carolinas you know we still have folks from the Gulf Coast that are going into the Carolinas and taking up collections to try to help those people recover\nFrom what happened to them was\nAnd I was speaking to somebody I just recently who\nWhose family had been just outside of Panama City and said that they that they were staying in like some uh uh I could I could have found a vacation spot at some level that said that they had just got finished sort of rebuilding after one of the last tropical storms that had come through there\nAnd now we're in a place where this big storm is coming through and you're going to have some real big concerns about the damage it's going to a kind of ... and I'm just seeing reports that looks like\nWe may have gotten from Ninety miles an hour winds up to over a hundred miles an hour won all five seems to be where we're at a at least at this level so this thing is building building quickly and it's picking up speed as it makes its way inland um there is a good chance at this rate that\nYou could be seeing at least a hundred and twenty maybe even a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds by the time it makes landfall tomorrow\nI think if there is a good thing I always trying to look for the good in these systems um it it I mean they were doing it but I it doesn't look like this is a system that's going to stall like some of the systems that we dealt with this hurricane season right it's been pretty ...\nThis is not going to be like for its where it's just kind of came in and then sat there off the coast and then just dumped tons of rain and then slowly moved its way around this is going to be something that like most I Would say\nTypical hurricanes you have kind of come in strong I hit the area that it's targeted towards and then start to die off a little bit as is the case here you're going to see it die out but that doesn't mean you're not going out of the strong winds when it cuts its way across through Georgia and in the Carolinas but yes you're correct at this point it doesn't like it at the prediction is\nAnd we all know that this can change but the production is that it's not expected to stall off on any level it's going to just\nJust forward as it has been and it's been developing speed as it goes I mean it was technically a tropical storm the other day and then in Maine and managed to pick up speed in with the way that this thing works is you have this rapid intensification where maximum sustained winds increase it thirty five miles per hour\nIn less than twenty four hours twenty four hours or less so that's happened once they're expecting at least another one of those possibly to here and the next twenty four hours\nOr a Michael Bauer I've spent the last couple of weeks asking you about the capital timeline yeah what is the Michael hurricane Michael timeline when when is that we can we expect the hurricane\nCabinet timeline uncle Henry I'll be honest with you a little clear so the\nPrediction is that you start to see some heavy when it first of all the indication from all sources right now is that if you whatever your plans are for this evening by the time you put your head down your pillow\nThat's pretty much where you're going to be to write this thing out so if you have a maid evacuation plans yet and don't have evacuation plans in order today where you're going to be staying tonight as we're going to be staying through this whole thing you're looking at tomorrow\nMorning around eight o'clock in the morning is when we get the closest to without actually hitting levels are going to see a great deal the wind and rain and then it's going to start changing and start to Macy's make its way in mid afternoon inland and the biggest impact there and\nWe're at a time Michael Bowers thank you for your time today [noise]\nWeb news headlines next and

Fox News\nSaid of the White House actually brought forward the idea of privatizing the postal service\nIt's in a one hundred and thirty two page report in June of twenty eight sheen\nAnd this is a big concern especially in rural Mississippi where it's pretty hard to make a profit because you've got a such a distance\nBetween homes and so you have a lot of postal workers concerned about their jobs or they're concerned about the quality of service and access\nFor people who live and work in these rural areas\nYeah that would be a concern in rural Alabama probably a any any anywhere in the country where you have to drive a ways to budge them civilization it just seems to me that there needs to be some rethinking of it I don't think we'll ever be without the postal service and don't want to be without it\nI I wouldn't mind if it dropped down to a few days a week of delivery would that bother you Kelly Bennett if they weren't coming by six days a week\nI don't think so I think a lot of us do our business and and that kind of thing on line anymore and\nI think I have noticed the past few years that\nI don't sign up for a lot of ah subscriptions and things like that so the junk mail that comes to me is really it's a pretty small stack compared to some friends that I have so you know these things can be handled yeah I think a couple of times a week I think\nThat'll work\nWe're willing Kelly been into the wall we will solve all problems if you present them to us [laughter] I don't know about all that\nWhere I think of whether together every ten minutes on the roads and then we're right back with more Gulf Coast ...

morning\nGood morning everybody let's hope you have sunny skies wherever you live [noise]\nYes uh likely I've I've watched a lot of the reporters they're dispatched out to the beaches\nYeah and I you know something that ... this morning it kind of hit me as I was introducing making Gannon going live from Pensacola because uh she she is a small town girl\nFrom Port saint Joe Florida and just before we might live to hurt Kelly said and in the ... the storm in the path or should make landfall somewhere around port saint Joe\nUm I Know she's been talking to her parents are in the last day or two and her dad was getting ready to evacuate or he did yesterday her mom is flying ... somewhere around the country but can't get back now so I'm ...\n... it's it she said I I as I as I toss the story to her so she could report I mentioned that\nAnd you could see her kind of catch her breath because she'd been thinking about it and all of us kind of caught ours because a suddenly it really hit home to us ah port St Joe is a small town and she went on to say at that moment that she graduated with Ninety\nKids in her graduating class that's how small it is and uh\n[noise] if you stop lights up in a in a couple of gas stations are but if this storm land serves a category three\nWhen Megan gets back to her hometown or it's going to be completely different and it it all of a sudden you know it's funny how you report these things but then suddenly something happens and they hit home that kinda hit home for all of us because we could see the look on her face about how suddenly a she had to\nTo try to step back in her reporter mode and\nAh continue on reporting from Pensacola so uh you know even though we're kind of far from the epicenter of the story it's just good every now and then to realize there's real people in the path of these things we felt it before and and so we know what they're feeling today\nAbsolutely and we're we're in we're far from the epicenter as you said but we're still we're just right outside of the cone\nWe are we're going to see in fact I'm and all the way over to Mississippi I think you guys might be under a a tropical storm watch or something or some kind of like insurance just in case it kind of\nYou know trends over a little bit to the to the west are we are under the southern part of our county ... county here in Alabama we are under a\nA hurricane watch all of us are under a tropical storm warning over here and then it just gets worse and worse as you go toward Pensacola and Fort Walton Beach\nAh but we are going to feel the effects stop an island already having some flooding just because we're high tides and and the ah you know the push the water from the storm but we're what appeals to the facts today\nIf we get some rain that will actually help us I don't know how much we we might get but I think um\nYeah we we could get some wind out of this and uh it's not going to be and it seems like they're going to experience all further to the to the east\nVillage yeah another thing that uncle Henry and I have been discussing is the exit path of Michael because as it makes its way out of the u._s. it's expected to hit the Carolinas and they're already dealing with flooding issues and I'm sure there are a lot of people in structures that\nYou know a aren't\nAs am to withstand some of these conditions that there are about to go through\nYour talking blue tarps I Know what you're saying there's a lot of ...\nThere's they think they've they've already experienced the worst but now comes a I guess just the insult to injury and ah they I Would think it I Would think that any structure that's going to be flooded already flooded but you're right there's there's wind damage and there's trees that have fallen there's groups that are damaged and homes are still possibly livable well\nNow they have to I'm sure there'll be scurrying to put buckets out and this and that try to try to just to keep a their households together those people who've been crippled by the storm\nUm it yeah it's it's so unfortunate as going in that direction a but but it is you're right and I and we will be feeling for them because you know I I I see still see blue tarps\nOr from the last storm that we had here years ago I still see some of them around town I guess people just couldn't afford to put new roofs on [noise] so um they're dealing with it and I imagine it's gonna be that way in the Carolinas to\nHey we've got about one minute left before we have to go to break before we run out of time but of course we'll keep you up to date on on hurricane Michael throughout the day\nOn our radio stations are heart radio stations and on NBC Fifteen before at a time Darwin a a a Gulf Coast singer from ... in Alabama was on
