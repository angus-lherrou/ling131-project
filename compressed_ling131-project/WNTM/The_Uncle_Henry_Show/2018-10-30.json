is that a market change\n[noise] yeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in law school at Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout it really isn't that high on that ... that sort of slipped from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I said listen you want you you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it\nBut we wish you had to take into consideration is is that women are going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into the c._e._o. positions\nAnd they're good one yeah oh excellent ones absolutely excellent once and and uh so\nWe're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\nUm what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that\n[noise] that Generation Z was born ... being born right now is is actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there [noise] uh\nBut Gen Z is not going to be entirely different\nThan Gen Y they that they are going to be this the same cyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much smaller in generation X. generation X essentially he's the parents of Gen Z\nA but it is what we're watching is is is a a a new crop of kids and and I tell folks and he said listen you know people say well these these you know they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they can't complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and I said let alone let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be find is just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed themselves\nAnd and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted for that\nI don't care listen it is what it is [laughter] what but listen here's here's how it works zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby\nYou want what you want when you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some positions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah would you tell me that makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible\nYeah it it troubles me it really does we knew not it's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a\nName for enlisted I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president type takes on a porn star in public

we're losing Ken we're losing the ability to debate question discuss without people screaming at each other\nI mean those days are gone I mean I I heard a couple of people in a restaurant tonight

Ninety nine five FM the dragon\nMobiles news headlines coming up in ten minutes before we get to the news headlines we want to welcome back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national corresponded bill ... good morning good morning uncle Henry going and Kelly money\nSo bill shipper outlined forest what's going to happen with our military and the southern border\nYeah this is active US military is being deployed as we speak to the border between the United states and Mexico there even giving it a name at the Pentagon it's called operation faithful patriot\nWhere these fifty two hundred troops will join the two thousand National Guard troops that have already been at the border and they will be assigned in a support role they will not be actively engaged with immigrants coming to the U.S border because they can't do that by law\nOf the law says that the U.S military can cannot directly and force\nUs domestic law including immigration law without congressional approval a show they will be there in a support role\nThere will be there with a military police there will be pilots who will be a will be flying helicopters and fixed wing aircraft with night vision equipment along the border area to help the border patrol\nOr there will be engineers working on roads and also to fortify sections of the fence that may need it along the border uh but uh do some of those service members have already started arriving at staging areas in South Texas Arizona and California\nAnd then it will be decided exactly where they will be deployed along the border but it's not I'll go Henry and Kelly like we're we're putting these troops all along the border area there with rifles trained at immigrants heading north of that will not be the case\nWell I'm kinda curious because when we talked to yesterday the caravan was growing so where do we stand in regard to the numbers and the caravan\nWell now it's it's getting smaller and as as you might expect because they're still about eight hundred miles away\nFrom the U.S border and they'd had been well the estimates are all over the place she heard upwards of ten thousand at one point now uh they say it's about thirty five hundred may have broken up into different groups uh but\nUh people are either a deciding that this is just not going to happen I mean going with young children and our or babies in some cases all the way to the U.S border uh and they may be accepting offers of asylum and unemployment assistance that Mexico has offered\nA so there are some people that are are taking that route and then\nIt appears that the Mexican authorities are beginning to step things up a little bit yesterday there were six hundred a group of six hundred who got on that bridge between Guatemala and Mexico try to get into Mexico and they were blocked by Mexican federal police and told the turnaround a so a combination of things would lead you to believe that\nThis caravan or the caravans or continue to move toward the U.S border the numbers will up drastically dwindle by the time they get here\nBuilds up for so many things in the country seem to be coming to a boil right before we vote yes so when are when do we expect this caravan to actually get close to the border will they get there before we vote\nNo uh no they they can't no way they can go these eight hundred miles in one week\nOr so they will not get there but there's a reason you're hearing about all these things right now because uh the the president wants to get his immigration policy out there\nBefore the midterm elections are for something that can be voted on ... and gain supportive Republican voters and those who agree with his immigration policies so they're getting all of the\nIts policies out there now oh so they can be a factor in the mid term elections even though this deployment of the five thousand plus troops is scheduled to last until December fifteenth that could always be extended so they're going to be there till at least mid December and it may take some of these immigrants that long to get there\n\nSo when they get their what happens\nWell the president has now said ah if they get there if and when they get there we are going to set up tent cities\nAre that when they get to the border and request asylum or we will say okay I hear you have to stay in this tent and a and a weight you're processing\nAlso he let it be known that the asylum process is going to be very stringent in fact uh the new numbers and show that for fiscal year ... Eighteen those granted asylum amount of two only thirty three percent of the total people uh that showed up at the border\nSo that is expected to go down even more he's telling people it may take months as well so if you come up here you're going to be put in a tent city un held they're not released until you can be evaluated for asylum and not many people are going to get it if you don't get asylum you're headed back home\nOr it will uh I guess was a time for one more question are we are we going to be here it as much about this after the after the midterms or is this going to go off the front pages\nI think it all depends on how this a caravan holds together\nI mean if it begins to dwindle I think it'll disappear from the news cycle or if it holds together and they continue to get closer to the to the U.S border then we will hear about it again but you know how things have been going up oh Henry a there is undoubtedly something gonna come up between now and then that will probably dominate things\nRight builds up or thank you for your time today You're welcome anytime\nTheir egos bills in for NBC News radio national correspondent\nRevenues headlines coming up you can always\nSee what happens during the commercial breaks with our live video that we have during the program you can find it on the news talk one oh four nine Facebook page\nAnd then after the show is over you can find it on ... minutes blog page as news talk one of ... dot com\n[noise]\nThis is a Bloomberg Markets minute shock future signal a higher Wall Street open this morning now futures up about a hundred points GE missed estimates in the latest quarter and is cutting its quarterly dividend do one cent per share as new CEO Larry ... take his first major steps to save the ailing manufacture\nIt David introduction is only the third since the great depression and is expected to save GE about three point nine billion a year investors seem to like the moves that shares of General Electric are up to ... percent in pre market trading this morning\nCoca Cola posted sales in profit they beat estimates and the latest three month period company got a boost from its lower sugar drinks such as waters in diet sodas\nCoca Cola also got a bump from higher prices in terms of Coca Cola arising before the opening bell quick check accrued ... this morning it's sixty six dollars fifty eight cents a barrel Dina already Bloomberg Radio\n\nWants to end underpaid I'm Alone we knew it\nWe're here to change that with your parents when one thousand dollars when one thousand dollars every hour radio seven ten WINZ and we\nAt the challenge for your safety and then when I feel I mean you could make it\nRained in front of your least favorite coworkers driven by mobile bay Harley Davidson new ownership you added to the Gulf Coast premier spot for all things Harley Davidson is where you can get a new army for as low as one oh nine I'm off find their events on Facebook there's always a party at\n...

the public works department so that will be I don't know if they'll actually happen today but that is something that will be discussed I'm sure the idea of whether or not they can appoint a special

come together and and say something or make a statement that the the hatred\nA must end toward all people that are different from each other or if we don't know I really don't understand it because this man\nThat to kill those living people and wounded several others and we forget to mention them a ... he didn't know any of them he had no earthly idea who they were what they stood for ... he didn't break bread with them he didn't spend time with him he didn't know their children\nHe he didn't know the love they had in their heart because his was so full of hate\nAnd I just don't I Can't

I Am lost for words when these things happen we had to uh African Americans killed him Kroger in Kentucky just because of\nOf who they were that man came in with a gun after trying to get into a
