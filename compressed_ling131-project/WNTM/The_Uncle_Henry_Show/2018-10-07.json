rolled out there with credit credit reporting I mean there's a whole just I think it's going to be a huge huge a new area of the law dealing with it already is a pretty good size area and are those are people that deal with credit but it's a\nIt has to explode just has to explode\nAll right Paul Paul Europe welcome to handle on the law\n[laughter] hello about a year and a half ago my Seventeen

people many others cups crashed but how do we\nRight okay so you do the age test and of course came up negative\nYes okay now what that's where I'm at and you know\nNo matter of fact there is nothing

stitches uh yeah the emotional ... there's not an ... an emotional issue when you get scratched\n[laughter] so no there's nothing there although you know it's always interesting is their right mind means or anything they're in you know everybody default this is America where you'd default to how do I get money\n... how do I get money\nAnd then we start talking about well what what happened in oh okay so there's nothing there well emotionally distraught ah I'm Upset because I I Want money and I can't get money and therefore can I sue because it might anticipation of getting money\nOh sure that's a great case oh why not\nAdding is high Agnes welcome to handle I'm a law saying goodbye to make sure I\nCall I got a problem I have a like a fake that's a that's a war that guy come the ... were less than half an hour and they kept me seven hundred and I didn't I doubt it I Wonder though I have and then ride with family and\nFor what I mean how much should you pay them and how do they\nKnow how much do you think you should do they fix it or not\nI think that fake that hoping let that happen hours\nIt doesn't matter I don't care if they fix in half an hour or did they give you a big do they give you an estimate\nThey then they may end or did you pay did you pay for the glass door being fixed\nAnd when do they do they say he was going to cost eight hundred dollars or just after the ... the hen or do a bill for eight hundred dollars\nNo they'll know not they are even just don't pay I pay\n... ... well then that's the problem you have a ...\nBecause you paid it and now you're saying I pay too much\nSo it's so they're going to say you accepted our\nOur bill the bill basically use verbal says I Want\nA eight hundred dollars and so on and then there's the issue\nOf or contractors over five hundred dollars you need a written contract but I don't think that's a that's going to be particularly important although it might be in a in the case of a a small claims spending on the judge so ah you wonder if it's worth something Agnes right does the work they did\nNot like what do you think you should pay I don't mean I think\nMore than ... God\nAnd there may be reasonable so you turn around soon for six hundred dollars\nAnd you take it to court and they are going to say you accept the deal and you're going to say is too much money and I didn't know and then I found out that they just rip me off its predatory\nBut I had nothing to do it if it and then\nWhat do you mean you have now did you hand them eight hundred dollars in hundred dollar bills in cash\nNo no I didn't my credit card\nOkay so you have the points that you pay them eight hundred dollars\nOkay and you're saying is too much and you and you want your money back and the overcharge you okay\nAnd you didn't know the overcharge you until after the fact and they're going to argue it doesn't matter what we charge we told her I was gonna be eight hundred dollar she agreed they're going to lie about it\n... and you're going to go to court and tell her to a judge\nOkay that's that's all you can do that I asked them before I go to you you have to ask them first okay that's the law you have to make a demand\nIn writing say you over charge me I've checked around\nAnd by the way you do have to check around you just can't arbitrarily say I I think it's only we're two hundred dollars 'cause what kind of expertise you have ...\nNobody cares what you think it's I've checked around and you do want to check and it's worth two hundred dollars you overcharge me I Want my six hundred dollars back you make that demand they're going to tell you to go pounds Sandra pound glass in this case\nAnd you are they'd go to sue\nWhen they say no [noise] not that complicated [noise]\nThis is handle on the law [noise]\n\nAt the bottom of the breaking news radio seven ten do when you when the whole meal and I orange radio and then and I'm forty nine W ... three mobile\n\n[noise] this is my heart radio Gulf Coast focus a weekly community program on my heart media mobile Pensacola with uncle Henry of news radio seven ten\nMarine has a sister of all the uh\nA door she's a precious woman and my sister in law was a friend of hers so the two of those girls got together and enter dismayed tomorrow\nAnd it turned out that another friend of mine was also involved with the American Cancer Society and so it was just a natural to just step in there and they were kind enough to let me play with them [laughter]\nDid the American Cancer Society help you through your breast cancer did you take part in any of the program so I have\nYet uh not only did it get involved behind this age and help with the wall too but the um look good to write you know program that was very important well you know when you look in the mirror and you're looking at a lizard I mean I had no eyebrows no ... I never had a ... hour when\n\nRemember looking at myself but oh she just sort of job as a the no chemicals kind of make you a little pale and now I\nI don't have a lot of color anyway so I was category by that stage it was just wonderful to have somebody you know sit down with you and say it's ... yeah\nThere's there's some things we can do it let's try this and it was it was very encouraging and it makes you feel like a girl again you know that's one of the bad things about cancer is that sometimes it\nIt makes you feel so less than you you you know you've lost body parts and you're going through a lot of chemical changes that really you know you have to kind of talked yourself into feeling good sometimes\nAnd to have a whole group of people out there that get that and understand that and support you and that and have ideas for you and I encourage a pretty big it really is I felt feminine again\nActually Morris has also here with us and Ashley you got involved with the American Cancer Society because of your family\nThat is correct yes uh initially I took a job with the American Cancer Society way back in two thousand two um and I started as a social worker the time my grandmother had just passed away from kidney cancer\nTo cancer Saudi was near and dear to my heart because of her struggle and then um after I worked there and my dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer and then um when my youngest was born I stayed at home with her for a few years\nAnd then just in two thousand sixteen my brother was diagnosed with breast cancer at\nForty age forty to say it was quite shocked to know that men could get ... get through to something that we didn't realize and my other grandmother on my dad's side who I never got to me\nShe actually passed away in her early forties\nFrom breast cancer all say say I have a strong family history\nOf breast cancer and say that so I'm delighted to be a part of the walk and this'll be the third year that we've participated at my office given those in K would weave them a team for three years now tell me about your brother how on earth if you find out who had breast cancer and that must have like you said that a shock\nI remember the day he called and told me and they drove off the road um he\nWas on a business trip to New York and he was getting ready and he was brushing your teeth and he just felt something weird when he went to brush his teeth like his his arm rubbed across and yeah a across his chest and he felt a lump and he has a friend that's an oncologist and he lives in Birmingham City called her\nAnd she's like oh you're not that special you know how to get Redskins are you kidding\nI'm so he he did not tell us at the time that he he told this story after yeah [noise] um but yeah he went when he flew back he went to the doctor and had a mammogram and found out you know they called him the next day and they scheduled in for surgery immediately say\nHow do I he's young great now he had 'em on the set to me and he had came into therapy and is\nNot had any other problems he's on a maintenance drug and won't be on a maintenance drugs um for a couple more years to come so\nMarlene that is it is a very rare thing\nIt is but ah the statistics are the ... about twenty five hundred men I'm In the United states will be diagnose this year with breast cancer so um you know it happens it is rare but it does happen\nSo your whole family is involved with making strides then I bet\nWe are we are I've I've really also gotten\nMy work involved with it as well not swear fundraising comes from is um from my co workers at the office they were\nMy brother it's just the two of us they were very clearly said when he was diagnosed I mean I was devastated I couldn't believe that he's always been somebody that I looked up to an admired and\nI'm always thought it was going to be me because of my grandmother having breast cancer and I had a cousin that had genetic testing done and she had told me just I guess six months prior to his diagnosis that she had been tested for the B R A C a ...\nAnd she was positive and she encouraged all the cousins to get tested which I did and I was negative and I remember telling my brother at the time like well I Wonder if he should get tested hand rolled his eyes yeah whatever you know\nUm [noise] he after his diagnosis he underwent the genetic testing too and he was negative for it so [noise]\nWe're really not sure he doesn't have any other risk factors um we don't know where his came from\nA will tell me more about your office because I think that's one thing that a lot of people they want to get involved with making strides and they want to get their teams together and they want to raise money and they're like\nWell we think out of the box and we think big at my office and my co workers are very supportive too like you said this is our third year so the first year I went to him\nI actually went to our regional vice president and I was like hey how would you feel about getting a pastor and in your face [laughter]\nI started at the top of the vice president and asked him if he drew upon it and say we he said sure why not say we split the team um we split the office into two random teams\nI work for an engineering an architect from say we like to make things up with the two sides and say we just randomly split the teamed up and we gave each team a team leader\nAnd we said you know by the walk whoever raised at the least amount of money we're going to pay you in the face [laughter] I wasn't even hers in it for them to raise money um and then last year I was like what are we going to do you know we we've popped into my day\nTo someone in the office is like why don't we shape somebody's head and say what we found too willing participants they happened to be red headed which we thought was funny 'cause we call it the ... the genders and\nMen or women ... men oh OK brave guys brave guys so we actually raised more money than we had the previous year by the um shaped race fundraiser\nAnd then this year I was really stumped I was like a calf certain upon somebody said I made somebody shave their heads what am I going to do so this year we went um a different route we want positive\nGuess you could say said the winning team is going to have lunch provided for them by the other team [laughter] okay [laughter] but I said I'm not going to tell you at a fun race this year y'all just have to figure it out and that's been really a fun competition and of itself so we have the same concept we have two teams to teen leaders\nAnd each team has come up with different ways this year to raise money what they're doing like bake sales or you know I'm not really something much more creative yes yes um so\nI have I started in twenty sixteen I call it a booth bucket okay boo bucket like yelling for Halloween I say it was a tradition that someone ahead dude us several years ago in a neighborhood where you leave a little happier\nDid they were going to talk with Down syndrome Alabama's suit collie welcome to viewpoint Alabama thank you ... it's great to be here today well first of all we want to talk about a little bit more I gave a brief synopsis of Down syndrome but so if you could define Down syndrome for us\nDown syndrome begins at conception it happens in all races and it happens to women of all ages but it it's on the twenty first chromosome that there are three markers instead of two so anti you and I have forty six chromosomes and a person with Down syndrome has forty seven so they have something extra and\nWould that something extra water some of the health issues or cognitive issues that someone with Down syndrome would experience\nIt changes how child develops both physically and mentally and so with help from early intervention I'm great health care I'm with a inclusion in schools as well as in the community and employment people with Down syndrome are selling\nAnd let's talk about that community let's start out with kids who are young who have Down syndrome are you finding that I find so often that we're looking at social media more and more nowadays of course many of us constantly we gain or news from that we gained all kinds of information especially entertainment from that\nAnd I do find that we often see\nSeveral instances that one might not have seen when I was younger in school when I was younger in school with a child had a developmental disability they usually were stuck in a classroom with other kids who were like them doing their own little projects and their own little world and us so called normal kids\nWere doing our thing but nowadays you're seeing wonderful moments like for example football games where a child with a developmental disability is cheered not only by his own teammates\nBut those from the other team while he or she runs the football to make the touchdown it it's extremely touching an extremely moving and I'm I'm just wondering are you finding that the younger people that you work with those in in school um that the attitudes\nAre changing especially now that we have new laws where the kids are mixing with other kids you know they're being just like everybody else young people are more accepting of kids that might be a little different\nIt has improved a lot like I went to high school with twelve hundred people in my graduating class and no one had a disability because of the exclusion or segregation um thankfully our our government laws and our educational policies have\nBrought inclusion um two people with disabilities and specifically Down syndrome and in our case more accepted yes but they're still so much more room for improvement the magic happens when you're in a classroom with children who are students\nSome with a disability someone out of his disability but their first scene as child as student an aspirin\nAnd that's where inclusion really happens we have all these exciting things happening like you know the Gerber babies has Down syndrome um we had Jake Pratt who ran the great football was went viral um we have people who are having um clothing lines and have spoken before\nA United Nations or that those are all wonderful things\nThe important part is to see that every person even those who are non verbal or have a disability is um\n[noise] more um maybe prejudiced against 'em and so if you think you'd you see somebody who has who can't speak you think that they don't know very much\nPresume competence instead of this ability and so we we try to focus on the word ability and we really focus on the were confidence and my favorite word is limitless for those in\nClassrooms are with kids who are special who have special needs who are\nAre limitless how is it best for a parent to teach their child about someone who may look a little bit different may react to things a little bit differently what are some good points that parents can convey to their children\nIn order for everyone to feel included in class\nLook first so be aware be aware that this person's there that there are a person and that they're in your community your classroom you're workplace your neighborhood\nThe second part is to accept and so that is sometimes means asking questions and not being afraid to ask questions it's like why does he talk differently um why does he have hearing aids why does she um\nHave to have an eight in my classroom why does she go to a different baseball team than I Do um can't she come on my baseball team well of course she could you know so that I think questions are great and to encourage parents to see what's more alike\nThan what's different and so and asking questions is really good staring or shining or um ... is not good asking questions learning more is great and that's what we call let's talk a little\nBit about older kids the those who are well I guess I always call when kids 'cause I'm of a certain age and they're going to say what but do those those kids who are getting out of high school and would like to go on to college we've seen numerous programs uh first thing that comes to mind University of Alabama has a summer internship program\nA word that the kids with developmental disabilities can come to the campus they can live the campus lifestyle in the dormitory\nDidn't take part in classes and then possibly a move on to a job so I'd love to talk a little bit more about what is available for those who are say Eighteen and over who are dealing with Down syndrome\nWe're really excited about what is happening more preparation needs to be made in school ages from fourth and fifth grade up through both through parents are going to find students interests and activities and their talents\nUm because if you feed those interests in activities and talents um that starts identifying what a person with a disability might like to do post high school and then our transitional services in high school again\nLooking at not generalization but specific identification of what this person um we'd like to do 'cause nobody wants to do a job that's just\nKind of just given to them but doesn't meet their talents were their interest on that they want to do so because that's happening there the students are more prepared for both volunteerism\nThey're prepared for um jobs they're put prepared for more secondary um post high school secondary um education opportunities so Auburn has a new program Clemson has a program Alabama has program you would be has a program Jacksonville state has program there's many many more looking into having those programs\nThey are really expensive 'cause they're not covered under any kind of a government supplemental um\nFor for um tuition the way our a child without a disability um tuition will be covered so there are things like the enable act allow parents to save for those programs and we were looking at secondary progress but also looking at entrepreneur is and there's a lot of entrepreneurs out there with 'em Down syndrome\nWho have come up with really creative ways to uh have their interests and their abilities and their towns use both for their income on but also for the community\nToday we're talking with sue tally she's with Down syndrome Alabama and we're talking about those with Down syndrome and the many things that are available for them as far as programs go and what we're seeing with those with Down syndrome that they are more capable than not\nUm I'd love to talk about ... workforce inclusion we were talking about some of the programs just a moment ago in colleges were gets with Down syndrome are learning more and able to get out into the working world and we are finding more businesses are hiring those with Down syndrome or sue what can an employer expect from someone with Down syndrome as far as work ethic\nThey are dedicated they're loyal I Know people who wake up in the morning one woman and is especially it's like she knows her schedule she has everything organized she wants to go to work she will give up or many other opportunities to go to work and I would I mean ask any employer who would not want an employee like that\nUm they want to be there they're friendly to the other um their co workers and it makes work really meaningful and I think there's some um employers out there\nWho are beginning to share their stories unemployed people with disabilities and Down syndrome and what a remarkable experience it is\nIt's great for the person with Down syndrome or cognitive disability and it's also great for the workers and for the employers and the customers\nSo it it's a win win for all and so and the only thing is is we need more we need more opportunities we need more employers and not to discount volunteerism too there's so many volunteer opportunities that people with Down syndrome or I'm a disability could do\nAt my local public for example I have a couple of kids I'm there with downs that are working there and they are the best\nAt their smile brightened my day and you know that's what it's all about you know I'm looking for good customer service and I get that I'd like to move on now and talk about some October events are we just celebrated Down syndrome Alabama awareness day\nOn October the first we got step up for Down syndrome walk\nSunday October seventh so some of you may be listening on friday some of you may be listening on Saturday viewpoint Alabama and some are listening on the seventh day of the event tell them all about it suits\nAre walk we used to be called the buddy walks but at one point we wanting to really describe what our mission was and that is that we're calling all people to step up for individuals with Down syndrome to celebrate them their lives to be inclusive in our communities and also to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Uncle Henry Show", "city": "Mobile", "day": "07"}
