{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "Where does the lending money come from Alan Paulos before these loans\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans\nUh today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise] ah so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education [noise] uh and it sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] but um so yeah this was a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit [noise]\nUh and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a ... something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans\nAre exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fair to collect the practice laws federal um a fruit\nThan lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove ah for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam\n[noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cabal of bankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes served\nOn the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise\nAnd she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered\nA bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system so you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run guaranteed horse in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point charge is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy writes a and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth than lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank get any private line of credit and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan\nWhatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know George ... of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding has cetera\nCan keep up with their budgets um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can\nGuarantee you now you're per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened well again\nThe colleges are sitting in the ... seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing in the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo polish much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really stream the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt\n... there was a story just recently where\nA guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger\nA worker is just out of college um after charge huge amounts just pay off that burden and you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond is shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others about how the student loan problem\nIs really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off such Ninety million dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses scaling entrepreneurship [noise] uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right so we're going to check in with you with phone calls with them in college when we come back if

back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC News radio national correspondent Michael Bauer Michael good morning\nIt's MORNING I'll call and good morning Kelly Abby Thursday guys\nHappy Thursday to you too so what is the latest on the investigation into the missing Saudi journalist\nWell if you saw the footage yesterday or the hazmat suits that were from the Turkish investigators are those those Turkish investigate it and the suit searching the Saudi council general's residence and is tumble yesterday and made the world news every\nA country that I could possibly see what's out there with cameras they were all filming it it looked like a giant press it was like it was like an Olympics of the press\nSitting right out in front of the Saudi council general's residence now the reason they were doing that and this was made very clear by Turkish officials\nAs they were released transcripts of this audio tape that they had a in their in their possession um\nIt was eleven minutes long in that audiotape or not only does it details the death of what they believe was Mr ... not only dead within minutes beheaded dismembered a according to reports he was tortured immediately as he walked through the door they began cutting off fingers and then within a two hour time frame that from the time you walk into the door\nUntil two hours later they were completely the killers or gone\nEverything was done and taking care of an out of the the consulate there\nBut one of the voices that they heard on the tape during that entire process with that of the council general who was saying to the people who had been conducting the torture and what they believe is the eventual death of ... are saying to them do this outside you're going to put me in trouble\nToo which of those individuals set back to the council if you want to live when you come back to re be\nYou'll shut up so that kind of lead the Turks to believe all the council gentle on some levels involved in this let's go check his residence and car and they wanted to do that two weeks ago guys but they were not allowed by Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia would not allow them to go search that and frankly the Turks didn't have any access until forty eight hours ago when that council general\nFled the country of turkey to go back to Saudi Arabia\nSo where where does this go now is that going to be is there going to be an effort to find out who knew what in the Saudi Government about this\nYeah that's going to be one of the big calls\nRight now that seems to be kind of ... where the investigation is going for the Turkish justice minister says that the the the investigation's ongoing but it is expected to be concluded soon but they're also saying that they're growing indication that possible video evidence that the men allegedly responsible for the death of ...\nHad close ties to the highest level of the Saudi Government uh we do know that when Mike Pompeo went to visit with the Saudi or the Saudi crown prince the other day\nAnd no uncertain terms according to sources he told the crowd print that he was going to have to own this situation and that every fact whatever those backs were every fact would eventually come out so uh my palm pale kind of highlighting or for the crown prince that even if we're not going to talk about fact right now just know\nThat everything's going to come out at some point in time so if there's anything you want to get off your chest now or anything you want to get off your chest relatively soon would probably be best to do that\nSo there has been a talk in the beginning as we were looking into the\nThe what we now now is the death of this journalist and you know President Trump was promising severe punishment he's kinda backtracked on those statements so what do you think that means I'm In in regard to our relationship with Saudi Arabia\nI Would say that right now the relationship with Saudi Arabia is good in Saudi Arabia has to understand that you know the U.S under the pressure to to have to ask for the call as more and more there's information comes out I mean\nYou know you've got President Trump yesterday saying that he's not giving cover to Saudi Arabia he wants to find out what happened who's at fault and then he believes it by the end of the week you'll have that information so in the meantime he's trying to deny that he's covering on any level but\n... as this goes on as more and more the details and some forensics are going to start to come out it's going to be harder to do anything but point the finger at Saudi Arabia\nOn some level here and the possibility of the higher up the\nFood chain within the Saudi Government that goes so there's going to be those kinds of of curious parts to this and then questions that need to be answered and with that Kelly Maguire Henry this is on the heels of today the U.S receiving a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia right at the same date my palm pale arrived there\nNow this was something that was pledged to the U.S back in August in regards to stabilizing efforts in Syria but the imagery the optics of getting a payment\nRight in the middle of this investigation right as President Trump\nHas kind of been saying the Saudis one of our uh our our our our greatest allies and then the payment of a hundred million dollars comes through the optics of that look weird and that's where people are starting to question when you couple that with some senators saying that the Trump Administration has a canceled intelligence meetings that we're supposed to be\nIn regards to the ... disappearance and that according to Bob Corker\nWhen Trump Administration says they are refusing to share any information with the senators going forward at this point so there are more questions that are coming up into what the president knows and isn't sharing and making transparent with not only the world but with our own government\nMichael about where we're at a time for this morning but thank you for your time today\nYou got to have a great rest of your morning\nTheir egos Michael Mauer NBC News radio national correspondent a very very messy\nOf course a

back to the Gulf Coast mornings NBC fifteens Darwin singleton Darwin good morning\nGood morning to both of you on this Thursday or friday which we like to call it\nA couple of really interesting stories that you've got kind of out of the ordinary that we wanted to hear from you on a now we've got the story of ... to ... it was immobile couple that ran into a burning building to help people\nFeel their own vacation a mission in mission beach in San Diego they were having caught by the beach a Tuesday Morning there's people screaming for help and lo and behold they look or to the building there it's like a business was downstairs or upstairs and it was on fire\nAnd um and their names are they are Christine ... and her boyfriend Jared or be and without\nHesitating they ran into that burning up carpet and got people up and out of there there are a couple of injuries but\nBut they say people's lives and they're being hailed as heroes and San Diego on TV and everywhere and we talk with folks in San Diego they let a share the story and so there you have is pretty impressive that these two people or so so what should and um and they said there was no time to be scared they had to get something done\nSo very proud of them being for immobile in San Diego is now hearing that we do is really\nPretty nice people down here on the\n... we all have to wonder when we hear the story or how many of us would run into a burning building\nYou know I guess it's just ...\n... some people would call for help others are just prone to\nThe more ... more proactive um\nBut they did what they had to do at the moment and I guess you calculate risk as you go a long ride but the important thing is that that ah these people there are a lot of elderly in that apartment complex apparently they may have not very possible\nPossible that they may have not gotten out alive so uh we're smoke inhalation just flames and things so we're very\nProud of them the sporting angel there are\nA couple of other stories are real quickly touch on this one and and then we can handle I Know a a mom in mobile a is accused of taking her son to a pre pet plant site overlap people stadium I guess in the parking lot or something somewhere\nAnd while they were there somebody pulled out a gun and shot mom and sons they're okay you're going to be All right but she's in big trouble because she um she took her son to a to a fight I mean what's the fat\nThat that I mean we've had stories like that before but it's always still hard to imagine that someone would do that her name Danielle Campbell she is a her ... she and her so we're both shot\nAnd they'll Campbell is charged with inciting riots that's why they plop down on her as far as the charge this morning but it more up lifting story well even uplifting it's unusual a woman in line the county in North Alabama uh she walked into her kitchen and found a man making\nA sandwich okay she didn't know him she did not know him [laughter] and he was in his underwear and she said why are you doing here and he says he's waiting for his close to\nTo dry grandma but she says is not as grandson she didn't know who he was he taking a bath brushed his teeth clipped his toe to toe they'll add a so\nShe'd go here's the part of it yeah\nI mean I got there by toenail clippers I prefer to have something about I don't know using them um well cops came in God and they said he appear to be under the influence a seminar caught it was a pilot but they took him away and she says I'm laughing about it now but she says I was scared to death at the time\nSo I'm of course what would happen if he had walked into your if you bought your house and so I'm standing there what would happen\nWell see that that's the thing not all of us are going to react in a way that this lady did he's very he's very fortunate that he didn't pick the wrong house\nThat's what I'm thinking yeah 'cause Kelly I'm I don't know would you what would you object Kelly I'm sure I'm just curious\nI don't know what I Would have done and there was a time when I thought I knew how I Would react to these situations because I have had a\nBreak in a couple of times at my house and both times the police told me when they came out they think I interrupted a flower glory and process and\nAnd so that really I was like I really don't tell me that sir I don't want to hear that and I I had so much anger over it that I thought I Would react to certain way\nBut then I had a situation where does this gentleman just\nAnd I had taken my kids to to some a fast food restaurant and he pushed on my son and just started acting crazy in was verbal raising me and all I wanted to do was get out of there\nSo I think when that when that fight or flight response kicks in I think I have learned I Want to fight in my head but the truth is that flight response is the one I'm going to react to limit again as you want to live for another\nDay your mom you got to take your child and I think that's why it out of the house call the cops what they know what they're doing\nA ... I Know some people may say well I'll check that situation but you don't\nKnow why that could lead to especially if you have other family members in\nThe house so but apparently she calculated pretty quickly that he wasn't a horn ... their frying eggs apparently it as underwear so are you going to do [noise]\nThank goodness that didn't get violent darling really darn thank you so much for your time that I have a have a great day guys do very goes door when singleton NBC Fifteen hey Kelly better do you have a great day you too long ago Henry banks yeah [noise]\n\nAnd this is a Bloomberg Markets minutes the latest snapshot of jobless claims shows a decline of five thousand two hundred and ten thousand last week that overall number was better than estimated Starbucks was already restructuring at home and now it plans to shake things up in Europe to\nThe world's biggest coffee chain is turning down its European corporate operations and giving its longtime Latin American partner the rights to open and run cafes in France the Netherlands Belgium and Luxembourg\nStarbucks is closing a support center in Amsterdam and won't lay off almost all of its one hundred Ninety workers they're\nShot futures indicate a lower Wall Street opened this morning as in the future is down eleven points NASDAQ teachers down thirty five\nNow features down Ninety six Ninety screwed is lower by one point four percent at sixty eight dollars and Seventy seven cents a barrel the broader us equity market was little change to yesterday ...
