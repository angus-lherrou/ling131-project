Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed\nUm he sold the strange ... he was driving along the road and it was sort of\nHumanoid with this huge wings\nBut it was kind of ... as well [noise] scares me a ... the shining a yellow eyes but they sort of the ...\nThe hair and go combined with the large wings um you know the the the head of the body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks like\n... ... and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend and you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I have talked about that before a that might be a ... year than to men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you Georgia I'm doing five books now on on these phenomena foreign the men in black and one on the women and black and I have to say that\nThe vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and say I'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking\n... you know go on and the skins why why why I'm I'm people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nPay for the even talks about when they're in close proximity to them by full and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when men in black and the women in black and turned up in homes right after paper being used in wage boats which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's\nThat's how I Would sort of describe this but many black mistreat it's fall be on you know just guys in a black suits walking\nOn you know\nI'm asking it into context sort of like with cattle mutilation says I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters are that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wells but we're in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nPretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you were people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the ... elections you know you've got a really weird ones you next play a couple of events some which are easier perhaps to explain\nThere is a power line with the men in black where there's no doubt that in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for the I might be but I think it's a very small cats agree\nVersus the the January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think is happening on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support this\nIs the over the years agencies may actually have employed the legends of the men in black I was amazed to cover their tracks in other words\nThe maybe paper within governments who know that many black are all too real but I don't know what they are but he doesn't prevent them from using the ... the most chafe\nResume and to to threaten and quiet papal who\nBut I may not want to I've been talking about the government may actually no no the men in black really don't fully\nThat sort of lead us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files what the government doesn't want you to know that ...\nBook uh whether or not you believe alien abductions are real the files on the elite abductions are real when I

Romero [noise]\nAnd on news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. and Ninety nine five FM the dragon mobiles Susannah lines coming off before we get to the news headlines who want to talk to\nBuild some for NBC News radio national correspondent build good morning\nGood morning uncle Henry come on and Kelly\nGood morning now the um the shooting in Pittsburgh over the weekend I'm not I'm I'm unfortunately I'm used to stories about mass shootings\nBut bill ... I felt a little caught off guard that it was that it was directed at the Jewish community even though I Know there's a long history of anti Semitism in the world and we know the horrible things that have happened I just didn't think that\nWe had something like that in this country\n[noise] [noise] yeah well there has been an increase over the last couple of years in twenty sixteen the FBI reported a a thirty five percent increase in anti Semitic crimes are twenty Seventeen there was a fifty seven percent increase\nIn the incidence so uh it really is something that has been on the uptick and when you look at the over the past several weeks we've had that shooting up in Louisville, Kentucky that it's now been declared a hate crime\nOr the the packages last week that could be considered political ate\nA than a you get this abhorrent ah incident over the weekend it really brings to the forefront once again that there are many different issues that bring out the hate and different people and different organizations across the country a and there's one estimate that there's many a thousand hate groups out there\nA coast to coast ranging from anti immigrant anti gay to black nationalist you're white supremacist do\nAll across the board so there is an awful lot of hate out there and I really think that and it played a part in the Pittsburgh shooting as well social media not the reason for these things but there certainly is a factor in all of these things because number one this social media platform gab dot com that this uh\nUh Bowers guy was on I had never even heard of before and uh you number one you can get your views out there or not um it's\nNumber two you can find like minded individuals and you can encourage each other and and that could become an inflammatory situation and the third part of it is these are all hot button issues that foreign entities have tripled our social media with a Russian meddling having to do with race issues in this country\nAnd racial bias religious bias\nImmigrant issues they ... they\nPoke at all of these things to try to inflame us here in this country and you know what I'll go Henry it's working\nWell the a and you mentioned social media so are you speaking from the standpoint that these groups or people that have had these opinions have always been out there but it's now so much easier for them to find each other\nAbsolutely a number one to get your views out there whereas before al yeah you could get a Yankee grab a bullhorn and go to a street corner or a ... but\nNow I mean all you have to do is go on and apparently this gab dot com\nOr was a website that while they their uh their approach was freedom of speech it'd it'd denigrate it into a hate site or that a track that people who wanted to get their messages of hate out there so you can get your message out there very easily and find other people who feel the same way\n\nSo are there any effort underway to maybe put an end to this particular side have you heard anything in that regard\nWell it's down now or whether it will come back remains to be seen it would be hard to believe that uh that they could justify coming back on especially if it generates the same type of talk that it that it has and again\nUh I for one I'd never even heard of it before this uh so it's down now I Would imagine it probably will not come up unless they they might bring it back up under a different name or something just to uh just to do that but if if this was one we don't know about that's out there how many others are there will\nWill build super you you mentioned um these estimates of how many hate groups that are out there and I'm sure the definition is going to vary from from person to person and also from who's doing the counting what about ... what about the government do does the government keep track of what they consider hate groups\nWell what the yes they do a and homeland security uh watches this as well as the ... the intelligence agencies and the FBI and in fact the FBI\nAnd it's interesting to me that they have only been tracking hate related crimes since Nineteen Ninety two are and what they show as well as we hit an all time low and twenty fourteen since then since twenty fourteen the last four years uh we've been on the increase and uh so there has been a trend going up word\nNot only in this country but worldwide I mean when you look at Europe when you look at South America and when you look at the middle east you look a lot of different areas where this was also on the increase maybe for some of the same reasons is that it's happening here uh but uh but this was not a trend just it's just exclusive to the United states\nAnd and really when you look at it\nUh these type of issues in this country have been around for a long time I mean when people were immigrating in the in the early Nineteen hundreds and you know certain ethnic groups or whether it be the Italians are the Irish or the Germans or weren't allowed to live in certain areas of cities and things like that it's been around for a long time\nOr it will build for um [noise] it it's it's yeah it's been around for a long time and it seems like something very hard to combat\nYeah almost impossible uh other than a a a dramatic change in social attitudes and uh that is something that may never happen I you know it really is very difficult\nWhere we're at a time bill super thank you for your time today You're welcome uncle Henry [noise] their egos bills in for NBC News radio national correspondent\n[noise]\nWe

hang\nUp then okay I saw some of that on social media\nOr you may have she may but then there's a real live a scary stuff going on over the preacher Sarah Lande area that I think even our Mississippi list there's Kelly can a shiver at\nAll right let me let me tell you what I saw because I saw this story on money NBC Fifteen dot com yesterday or in the reason I looked into this is because the headline is Barry a provocative man arrested after suspicious circumstances after Pritchard grandmother's house burns\nAnd this involves his grandmother\nSo the story a perjured may and taken into custody shortly after his grandmother's house caught fire\nA he was arrested do the suspicious circumstances based on eyewitness accounts and the heavy presence of gasoline porn across the back of the house before to nodded\nUm this was three different times that house was on fire in one day\nThe firefighters had to come back to put it out three times so ... the lady loses her home of forty five years and um there's mounting evidence that her grandson was responsible and family members said that that fire may be connected to another house fire friday and fairly\n[noise] yeah and that one a\nWitness or say they saw men pouring gasoline on that house and set it on fire and the thing about that house it's a it's been banned allies we've been reporting on it it's been vandalized or at least four times with pit bull a breaking windows are pouring paint all over\nA this woman's cars a it's been happening over and over and then finally we get a call friday she says\nMy house is on fire that tried to burn it down and I even got a text message from someone that said we will or in your house down so it was a fire but apparently somewhere over in that area and you know talk about living in fear if you've had\nIf you've been tormented like this and then you come home I don't think they're home completely bird uh but and then on top of all of that\nRichard's having an issue keeping working fire trucks and um we're going to hear from the mayor a little bit later today they thought they had agreed to purchase two new fire trucks for that city which I think they've got a couple that just limp along and uh and now they're saying oh it's going to cost too much and they backed down from the deal\nMayors bad so they're having a um a meeting this morning so you got fires in one city you're worried about whether you can put them out or not\nNot good no\nYeah this this uh family that was they were being vandalized over and over again I remember seeing the stories on TV
