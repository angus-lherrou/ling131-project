reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely\nAnd the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty and then when I come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the

things who's there\nThe pay for that my new published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show\nIt's like on my news website over a coast to coast to I'm going to take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your uh analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical but the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation which is is that some of the layers\nHave a different thickness in stone that take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review or a who was it was very well known a ... a shop here who don't we reviewed my paper or he calls the waves and I call it sort of a feather effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by plane there's peach tree a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker corps\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend and then you have another sudden jump in sickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's ... peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\nHave rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so you found that there are round fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these creepy courses and that was it uh it was not for interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and in the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred ten\nUh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed\nThere was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top and the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researchers proposed this is Robert ... father John Paul will go out\nAnd the papers on I think it's on a Robert ... vaults or\nAcademia a page and it's also in cosmic womb uh his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains this theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and now of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and ten courses\nNow we have is there\nA consistency to the ah repeating of the sticker layers\n[noise] um ...\nDoes it every ten steps that every ... there's some kind of ... you\nKnow I that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck by when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nOr because you know you were you could just you know simple in mind that I thought each step they were just a applied the ah the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian the Egyptians designed their appearance with uh something called they called they set that which is the pyramid angle\nAnd it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go up you go a certain amount forward and that's how the conceptual lies a pyramid and go so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same\nAnd and it's not and and ah and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's low regularity even to that thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nWe'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen veteran decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle\nOh on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in the shape to block interview I I think I said that uh the one to ... I'm sure a shock to create published at OK what's disappearing or during\nThe seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it was an arcade in the paper it was a star Morocco\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country\nAnd because of that because that constellation ... grows so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the paper and we try to preserve it ended up in that in the north stuff uh orientation\nI gotta jump in right there that says coast to coast and we've got to take a break my new is ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] good Daily Show updates writes your inbox for free to go soon newsletter sign up to the coast to coast am dot com [noise]\nDown and find them on\nAnd on\n\nOne side can Egypt [noise]\nMoney October Fifteen what's new today on the free our radio a radio\nPerfect for decorating the house or just setting the dairy mood\nOwn means by the pilot has killed tracks with labor is why why we've\nFantasy football or soccer jak\nJoe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute after a crazy week on Wall street investors have some earnings reports to look forward to starting today with bank of America Ryan Detroit ... financial says what we learn may settled some nerves\nThird quarter earnings is kicking off that potentially can be the next big driver that can really help people take a step back and realize hey it was ... normal in October but the under wire economies still strong\nMorgan Stanley Goldman Sachs and Netflix report earnings tomorrow Netflix shares were boosted by upgrades from Wall street analysts who said to sell off had gone far enough the latest us retail sales figures are due out today they probably picked up in September forecasts call for a seven tenths of one percent increase from the previous month\nAfter a lower reading in August that was the weakest in six months Brexit gets closer as a U.S officials meet in Brussels tomorrow recreational marijuana becomes legal in Canada on Wednesday and China releases GDP on friday Martin ...

going to get to that ... that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this kind of way yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right\nBut then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a it it that the which has a surface area that is around fraction of twenty fifth Nineteen twenty fifth that\nAlliance with the uh the uh you know the ... that ah that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier where they're feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also has a round fractional twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nUh then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the feeling of the um off the ground at tower I'm\nNow there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of the relieving chambers inside the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be will eighty four\nNo role eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be um you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the hope that the voice\nI got it yeah yeah of\nCourse we don't know exactly but we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know paint that that into this illustrations just to give a ... guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from ...\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egyptian use of the lion\nAnd the use of the lion and go back to lead tabby and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things thrown dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shock we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land and ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the uh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of Beckley tabby\nThe erosion on this thing's all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yeah which makes go Beckley tapping not an accident\nNo within references of course uh with the lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely not it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new

Thomas Manu\nJeremy thank you for taking my call Manu ... search you know my question as we have the subplot to do and the pyramids the banks have there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original pouring a subplot to do and I know that sounds radical but for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties sub remote viewing him to an intuition and actually\nReconstruct temples repair the temples have spent discussed\nYes and as such a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the\nMinister of antiquities is trying to partially restored monuments so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern reconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do affection\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched so that's the first part of your question but there's something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard uh it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter a menu alien um\nThey are basically recreating gives a a a ... in the in the virtual world and I predict\nIn a few years you'll be able to uh descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked or the the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and it'll feel like you know uh the real thing and I they're working on it\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid where did you come up with a number six or eight\nWhite so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know the simple rule that the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth\nI think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to school out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're up next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about\nThe uh selling he'll watch a ... many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids in for research and just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better\nAccess for research and the general public can I'll take my answer off the air\nGreat question Daniel my new what's it like there now with that I saw you\nRegarding talked about so first of all I have a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in person than he probably doesn't know why I'm\nRegarding getting a permit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are um and I think I'm so I'm hearing mixed messages so on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they want research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and there's nothing you can do about it other than you just try it and see what they do\nWell do you see that the the ... one research would be ongoing like it is is bizarre yeah while she was still the director there\n... I think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved or at least not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he is involved they ask employees at by a is input\nUm you know I think there's sort of mixed back here you know there is the public's eye of us who you know comes on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientist you archaeologist who loves what he does\nUm you know it's difficult to kind of saw it at all out but I think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to search them and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects\nThat ah you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being said some political right now and I understand that I knew it and I respect that\nYeah I mean there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stand and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction says why are they gonna have to open ... are they going to have to back that'll yeah\nSo it to the to the listeners question I think I forgot that goes down you know I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you you said two thousand eleven so I think that has something has changed uh they're sort of a you know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA say and they can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for the country and I think it's\nGood money jumping right there I knew I going to take a quick network break this was coast to coast am more minute when we come back stay with us\n[noise]\n\nCheese\n\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute earnings reports may dominate the news on Wall street this week major U.S financial firms are releasing results including bank of America Charles Schwab Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley black rock and American Express\nWe might have received a taste on friday of what's to come with J.

oh sorry about it a low\nOkay so I said well let me let me jump in I guess what you're asking my new is ah the origin of the word pharaoh and where did it come from from a which which people\nTo read this or that ... ... to ... ... ... to ... the main all of the pro which it ... the push language\nKush which which is of course ... ... to ... years ago or ... or ... or ... the you know we're

I'm going to pass that up to my new I actually have a couple of comments about that Isaac and and thanks for the phone call a minute the origins of the word pharaoh and its meaning\nYeah I I couldn't quite some thanks for sure but I couldn't hear the whole question I I'm ... so so he chipped colleges are things that are in the old kingdom a that term was not use\nSo the term pharaoh it's technically speaking doesn't apply to the king of the old king them I think the first ah I'm I and I can't remember if it were looking for new kingdom when you start using that term uh and that probably means that's when it first appeared and that's\nAll I Know about it offhand I said what I've read about this before but I don't want to say something wrong so I I this is what I remember\nRight in that there's two two points that need to be brought out here a bomb we're ... we're going back to a man as a um and the first and now I'm going to say the word they were referred to as kings\nYeah right right like in armor and men is\nUh the first ah kings of Egypt could be some are saying that the the same uh ... may be the same or they could be two different teams they weren't called pharaohs back then\nRight and now there's another uh uh\nUh I have research that is a little bit and I find it fascinating that the Kurdish people were the original Egyptians and the the ... that are there now I'm more more workers or possibly even slaves to the Kurdish people\nYeah um yeah I Can't really comment on it because I don't know enough about it um I I it regarding what the king was called I can tell you that uh by the fifth dynasty the king had five different title um and then the very beginning um you know the\nKings were called horse came so it was horse law armor and hors ... or so\nThat that was the first that was the first title and then quickly after a ... you know the designation a natural vet which is basically referring to offer and or\nAnd then came the two lady's name or you know and then came to cartoonish name later um but uh the as you just set yourself so Harold came later I I just looked it up and I was like twelve hundred BC is the first time it

[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am on this beautiful Sunday Now Monday morning here in Southern California my new uh the phones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it that do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think this is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monument\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino\nAnd do you notice is are there any other pyramids in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meaning that's just what it says in the winter we don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that do you knows referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah within the alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I I watched this documentary uh which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments\nAre lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely they suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nA has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea when we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout\nBottom all of the Honduras 'em and believes at the tops of these pyramids there's always something there\nWhat about the top of the great pyramid is what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber or something at the at the upper levels\n[noise] ... well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space uh that I'm connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off a vow has proposed that the summit of the great pyramid was not a peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would've been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that fear is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory or and others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a state Jeanie and a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great fear of it is a lot of media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise ... um\nNo you've got to anomalies in a and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI think so\nHow big would it be the way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that height um how big could that chamber be\nI think a a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet or something like that five feet by\n... Hi I'm saying right you know maybe maybe a five\nSix courses or something like that\nUm and it would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year scan was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you'd have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but ah they might not be stacked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that\nUh Rudolph gumption bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face you know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do it to me is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that\nAh who Don and buyer investigated it's up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the northeast corner right the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers that made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the plates and throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I think if you do any kind of invasive a project or in a project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and ... that's the kind of money that will need for a project like that\nThis is coast to coast am heroes to be church it's been an all Egypt the great pyramid evening here going into Monday morning more with my news said Sunday after this short break stay with us [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] both her\n[noise]\nBeams what's new today on the free I our Radio Free\nFor decorating the house or just setting the scary move\nBooming spicy platelets zeal tracks with labor in my life and we've\nEveryone's talking about like the fantasy football or soccer in the Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute as the week on Wall street begins investors might be hoping for a little less volatility after last week's wild ride the ...

[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAlright welcome back to the coast to coast and beautiful Monday morning here in Southern California and like I said my favorite thing to research my favorite\nIs lost history and Egypt and our guest tonight my new save side they published a paper that you can read all of his papers\nOver on his website Chiapas pyramids a dot com and the links to that are over ed coast to coast am now minute before we get back to the calls I have talked to before and I mentioned this in my opening\nLittle rant here tonight on coast to coast which is and knees you we seemed to have amnesia\nAnd it's all over the place but\nIt's it's ... it's not represented any more plainly than what happened\nIn Egypt after Cleopatra and we had that example of it but it was going on be for a year she was the last pharaoh need to be before she committed suicide\nThe amnesia had already set in and what we need to and you mentioned this uh last week on my other show fade to black which is this that Cleopatra\nIs nearer to us then she is to ancient Egypt there's three thousand years there there's only two thousand years on this side\nOf of Cleopatra and that's an insane amount of time we don't really understand how old the Egypt is until you look at it in those terms right\nRight and then going back to go back to tip the and the time when we think the original stinks was built then you double that entire time period one more time\nAnd more\nWhy is it that we we are so quickly to forget the past\nWell I think because ah I ... as Graham and cook a Robert shock I'm Robert Duvall and other office um you know have proposed that there was a catastrophe on earth and it wiped out or the evidence of\nThis ah these are earlier people and uh the only thing that survive ... how about these monuments\nUm and so uh I think that's probably why we've forgotten I I always remember this great movie planet of the apes the original one with Charlton Heston of you know when he lands on the planet that he thinks is another planet but it's actually earth\nAnd then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way\nThat ah that this earth has an Asia and that you see the statue of liberty bird in the sand and I just had such a profound impact on me that movie um and I think that's sort of maybe that's the story that we're living in in reality\nLet's let's head back to the phones it's been an incredible my here with a with the audience and\nThey they are just as interested in finding the answers to these questions as you are I and let's go wild card is going to Dorothy in Carmichael, California Dorothy Europe next on coast ...\nHow I'm okay with me and he can ... ... ... that can and cannot whereas respond to both for all that when our credit he had heart in my room ... like\nA ... ... ...\n... ... ... in it that way it is harder than\nI thought in in mind here I'm ... ... ... it ... the I think when they can then maybe you could recreate mom model if they would like that\nA ... opening hit hit the kid there you know found and we had kind of thing like ... ... they had in mind where he now than they can ... get it there you know it it while you have to think how\nAre you talking about the Winchester House here in California\nYeah remember how ... how to build on their infection and they go get confused when it bother her and you know he you know life there at the end but she had in mind if you went nowhere [laughter]\nYeah and the spirits we'd get lost\nIn there and get right now I Know there and eat it again\nAnd then you know they wanted the oil because they do that and they had a rat\nAnd maybe that's a great they when they're younger they're okay well then it kind of sit there for a long time than getting out there and on and maybe\nDuring the during the I'm going to jump in and and and say\nThat you are on the something my new and I have talked about this the the blocks in their rooms in side of the great pyramid our acoustic lead tuned\nThey resonate add a bowl many frequencies but one of the main ones is a four forty which resonates through out the great pyramid doesn't it Manu\nClare right and I was so they have a couple of comments about your question Dorothy so first of all Christopher done or when he was talking with Jimmy a few days ago um I think uh if you ask Christopher done if ah if his model his theory\nMakes has room for the uh you know extra space as the pyramid he may say yes\nI'm a ... so I could because it because of these residences and General Electric ... energy focusing and all those things so that's the first part of your ah one ounce or\nThe other answer about ... you were talking about the spirits of the kings so I you know sort of the same vein I I think so first of all the Egyptians did make rooms\nFor spirits of the king and for a ... to receive offerings basically so we know that ... had a small room in front of his pyramid where a statue of him was placed\nAnd uh it was basically looking out to the little uh you know the cold\nUm and ah have me or do you ask about him you know so I mean you know uh his must stop I actually had as a room a small room and the statue of him was placed in that room and then it was wild up and what was that for it was for spirit\nTo receive offerings of from you know his family and so I think you are I think you're absolutely right and in fact what you're asking is very much in line with what the Egyptian believed\nThat uh uh you know that ah just the spirits were very much there there were very much present and they just have to be housed inside of either a mommy or statue and then it became alive and uh and it was still interacting with a family members with the friends\nGreat call tonight let's go west to the Rockies to Garret
