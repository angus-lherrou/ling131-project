of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts you'd\nNever stopped working on it does you know I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on the first pages of new news articles infection\nI started to come across these are stories about\nUm something that looked like they were when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it'll free wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic is it's convincing that something over the years has been around us and it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big foot Wildman and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when you were first here can you recap the hoop a project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight or I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and to the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they tell the story that [noise]\nDependent leave without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big foot encounter in the mountains of the ... and they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked that they each had a similar encounter and they said you know Dave\nWe you have Twenty years as a police officer or you have years of investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent look will finance it you go about it at your own pace me no your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down in the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the police that a police background I approached them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell come back we're talking with David polite us about big wild man and giants the newest book an archive of articles that go way back to sixteen eighty a describing these creatures people whatever you want to call them\nAnd before the break David Was explaining how why he and some colleagues had collected a whole bunch of samples dozens and dozens of samples that were submitted to\nMarry a a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal um observations that didn't belong in the paper but the\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\nWell that's the part that I I don't think a lot of people understand it a this wasn't some half ale treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best that DNA was sent to for certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results or was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her now people are saying going to say well how do you know that's big for their well big foot hair looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd when they said that there another tribe of people\nThis community and the big for world\nThat is very adamant that they're an ape throws this completely off the wall and when you dig deeper in it most Native American tribes in fact probably Ninety nine percent say it's another type of people will try\nAnd this article goes right to that point and nobody was ever written a book before tribal ever brought that out\nAnd when I when I found it I couldn't believe that nobody was talking about it and it it's stunning still that nobody wants to talk about it\nYeah I Wonder what those tribes if they're still around would say about it now\nYears later nine years while I can\nI can tell you that being around tribes in the mid west and in the west like Harvey and I were it's consistent they still say that it's a type of people\nYou know the descriptions of course as you have noted that the term big what started to Nineteen fifty eight so before then people in other words for it and it and then many or most of the early clippings and stories that you have collected they call them wild man of course I guess that would fit I mean\nThey they're humanoid shape they're out in the forest there Harry\nUm they don't know what else to call them\nSo walks like a man walked upright and doesn't walk bent over and their knuckles aren't dragging on the ground like an ape um\nIf I I always tell people I said well if it's an animal then it's probably going to be found and it's probably going to be identified and you could probably go view and study\nAnd wild man ... that's a different sort of thing it's a different kind of topic very elusive a ...\nI don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and studied them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods and even the animals on the ape gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nIn ... that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions and the articles are ... are made me chuckle a little bit because the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining\nIt must have been an old friend so and so who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown hair all over his body\nAt a\nTropical with you on and I think people are scratching\nTo bring in some rationality to an irrational observation [noise] um and the parts of the country where the things are seen you know get way way below zero shows\nHow Fred that decide to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAt and grow hair all over his body like that a thick long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from the late Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom\nThat said maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter it's a fairly famous and counter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I think it was like yeah\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went in to the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what\nMaybe some exporters wrote about that they heard in which he encountered so but again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an explorer from the Watergate church\nWas coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in his explore note that this thing came up to him while he's on his horse and look I actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy by could he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or ... and it came from the archives with a wet or they church butter de saint church and it's in there so to say that these things happened happened ...\nUh the first entry the oldest entry comes to us from Jacques ballet you wrote about it and have a clip from\nSeptember Seventeen sixteen eighty it was a reported in his book wonder in the sky a large black wild white mass landed in a field releasing a huge error covered being that we're seeing briefly and disappeared now that's the kind of thing that will drive\nUm big foot people who think it's an ape just crazy\n[laughter] you know I'm not sure how many people listening actually bought a ... book on about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm Phil over and said wow I don't think anybody's ever heard of that\nAnd a book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of did the same thing with the UFO topic that I did on this big topic it was a starter I again I don't think a lot of people want to hear that\nYeah I I uh I was part of that project and um and supported it and it's a tremendous book people can find it anywhere they should check it out we're talking about ... about his latest work big foot Wildman and giants archived articles sixteen eighty

like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nThese look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are they looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's a general consensus that are\nSort of match what other tribes dated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and here's an occupied land to find a group or an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson gambling film and it's you know people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that's being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the being as that that that you're you have drawings up and this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nOne I did when it came on film and wanting Harvey has the ability yet\nIf let's say somebody goes in to a bank Rob the bank has a beard on a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving army has ... and ...\nIt would be to take the beard off the face\nSo you can see what the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's in tribal Dick foot and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your account the news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentation to conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members\nOf people from northern Ukraine of people from China and I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look\nIf they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just fall was what what was what we understand about our own people\nYeah fewer ... came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from a 'cause we we bury so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but there was a an incident where somebody's campfire\nTheir camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a in ... in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed a playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter they knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen them awake playing like kids in the water um it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans do sort of chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book off to look for a of a big but that's supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was ... and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who side how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought the big for was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did and\nSince the four one one books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies of people do not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth\nYou're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up so when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about from these guys and they say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get them or just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I Would have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there was never any names attached to it though no no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who shot and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where and in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to human\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that\nAnd I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some uh reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and hey invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nThey don't know how it goes way up in the tree and it's a tornado or hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your on coast to coast am\nLiterally [noise]\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\nUse radio seven ten doubled you win the em [noise]\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute\nNo economic indicators are scheduled for released today government reports on new home sales and durable goods orders and revised estimate of third quarter economic growth highlight the economic calendar for later in the week\nQuarterly results from Kimberly Clark has rowing Halliburton will be out before the start treating this morning\nThree I'm McDonald's Microsoft and Amazon are among the company's opening their books later in the week there's been a lot of speculation recently over whether the economy is nearing a downturn Nicholas guard side of J.

history the two authors are Sarah ... and the claim documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis she became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of eleven non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been cited before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program a I Am blown away by your book grey tabby here\n\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen or most teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nOr actually with a documentary that I thought I was watching it with my dad it was about the core and they reduced the story of the ship to align which was the ship that carry the bomb and [laughter]\nAnd I had to know more about it so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually\nGo to the library [laughter] imagine that and you know through looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I thought oh someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so\nYou know I thought out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and you know FlashForward graduated from college and then we'll know ones pulled the story and you know the right way yet\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion and that's where I actually got to meet the men\nWho survived Indianapolis and\nI mean you know I was a kid who was meeting her heroes for the first time and they exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes\nThey asked me to be their storyteller and that's kinda the cliff notes version of it\nAnd Lynn for you how did you ah hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project for me the way I got involved was I had actually been praying I'm I Do pray about my work and I had been praying to have\nAn opportunity to work on an iconic World War two story and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven out of the blue I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah Vladeck\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis was that I'm In being Indianapolis the storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she pitched it to a major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we've seen since ... brothers\nBut we only base mini series on foot\nSo you're going to need to write for a while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff so your family and friends she reached out and and made contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I'm a navy veteran she didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise] and\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting was advice and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my\nJoke is is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or in the way the helper but a eventually over the course of several months we finally met and then uh\nWe agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the project pick a three and a half years\nTo Syria where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started you know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I ... I knew a small part of that um that was definitely part of what I wanted to tell but\nReally I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nA sinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprints commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaigns that he participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so there was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sent [noise]\nI'll tell you you grab ... my father was a ... at ... he drove a landing a craft from those ships took good troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those complex grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to ah give us the version that did you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned ... was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shed and I'm\nA small part that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle of south now or where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent for on the fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theater I'm Victoria said okay now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nA\nNews radio seven ten ... when you when GM\nThis is a Bloomberg Markets minute investors won't get any guidance from the economic calendar today and the earnings calendar is light with reports from Kimberly Clark has burrow into how the burden expected before the market's open\nGabrielle Santos J.

that is nice to have Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt and the uh here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from men or ... point of view and there was a chapter on it voted in Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger the war in the end of World War two in general we were able to really develop its personality a lot\n... cared for men he was the commander in very very frustrated with data technology on Japanese that marine and really against her to call at the time it can definitely had a very autocratic Afghan military\nUm he went around banging on doors at ... radar and more technology that marine because\nAnd one of those harrowing stories was where there were\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and then we're spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked and there was nothing left\nAnd so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that they're a rescue arrived the men were really in ... they were able to tell or know what was happening\nThat point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark ... attacks increased as I guess you know I don't know how much sharks realize things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts um attacked increased and you know this is\nI Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think saying one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so thick they could walk on their back you know from shark shark that we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould have there's stand on them there's one account you have the sailor who you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking down things drugs thinking oh there's food all just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young EMT and by the name of John ... than he actually took his socks off and thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was\nNearly out of his head at this point and put a stock back on quickly and managed to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSo some of the worst effects Lynn are or what happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here\nYou know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's almost\nThe end of the war and they were having this leisurely a sale they think across the Philippines the um and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but it's Sara mentioned there were only a sixteen rap\nBetween there were there were four groups within three groups that there were four groups of four rap or three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so so there were so any water that was available with only available\nOn the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and they were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were than men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself with perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nThat some of them to come to the idea that they could drain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into the into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't and then others would you take small for it is that the water\nI'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called ... and\nBlood vessels bird\nBlood cells ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself or something else has to be around you that or it was out of sight all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it did sunk quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a ... ... who ends up testifying at the court marshal waiter or an American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention are we going to go to a break in about a minute maybe a bird Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting and general who had been wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's a late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this you know kind of explosion coming from below and there's no reports coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah he I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times and yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it and he still went to you know he asked a navy personnel at Guam I Believe\nYou know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they his son who you know this gentleman richer live Francis he passed away but his son carries on this story and you know there\nHe actually had diary entries of the time and coordinate said when he saw this and it did line up with it but he didn't find out until a few days after when word worth released about it that he would\nWe're talking

radio seven ten WN GM\n\n\n\nWhen been since I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined conspired to make things worse is if things just sort of ... through the cracks a they made their survival even more improbable\nWell as Sarah mentioned there with the the um\nDeparture message that didn't go through from ... to the Philippines there with the tenant on the Philippine side who had received a message saying that if\nA ... it's a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well\nHe wasn't the brightest guy in the world and that as a matter of fact had received a fitness report saying as match that he thought well\nIf I don't have to reporter rivals the combatant ships I guess that means I don't have to report non arrivals either and then you know to be fair to the navy the entire focus was on the pending invasion at the Japanese home island\nSo all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combine to make it said the Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until ... bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors responded in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the book Sarah ah about these pilots that they dropped all the supplies and trying to uh give these guys in the water or something you hang onto and they're they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to hit back in there was one guy who's swimming way out\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I I don't know where he was swimming too or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left on your plane to help this loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking two and a leave men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected than the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they you know\nWho do we take if we're in our ship or else the VP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carried till the end of their life\nYou know it's wartime as ... said the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and um there's a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but uh [noise] is it an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day in well reporters\nAre reporting on at that at reporting on the incident at the time did not believe it was an accident so the rat to occurred beginning on August second\nUh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August fourteenth ... between the time zone fourteenth fifteenth Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk in these papers did not release it Washington not did Washington did not release it\nUntil the jade de until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five I mean Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over and then maybe below the fold in a very small article you at the Indianapolis cruiser sunk\nAnd reporters that time believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that with\nYou know resulted in a lot of almost nine hundred men on the very brink at the end of the war\nSyria talked to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and then was the court marshal inevitable couldn't let him slide given that the war had just ended or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating this on the streets but their families now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who is involved in who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to this thinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame\nAnd a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there with a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented this situation and so really you know\nAt the time these names the you know admiral king and brilliant limits and all these these men who were essentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nAnd the American public you know holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom\nAnd have them testify in tarnish their name like I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel though the moment that he was\nBrought to cart court marshal there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA limb let's talk about the court marshal or or had mentioned earlier uh the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commander in to testify that had never happened before and then uh\nSantos thinks there were technical reasons for the turmoil on Wall street she is not blaming geopolitics or trade worries

are when you heard the news I think it was last year that the ah Indianapolis had been found a who is this a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier this some commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and since there they found the ship and\nI didn't know what he was talking about it for in the morning of and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nA the ... group which has the vessel that were ... responsible for finding the ship and there's been several attempts than they were the first one to be successful\nTechnological uh item that could target the ship ship may have been more aware of uh uh uh being at risk even from from a technology that or Japan\nTo tell you what Joe that's quite a bit to chew on their lips let them tackle at least the last part of that question a nobody on the ship I mean really no one really knew what it was\nYeah even uh even the cap and didn't know what it was that this with\nThe most closely guarded secret at the entire war and the most highly classified naval mission of the war\nAnd so even a even as I said even the captain didn't know what it was only major from and it was and his uh his companion happening again now when he was a long to monitor the radiation so\nThere was a little chance that a Japan would have now and and I don't know that extra precaution with taking\nBecause ship with traveling so fat almost at thirty not that they cut it out ran any Japanese submarine that were to try to target or\nSome funny stories about speculation among the crew about what it might be a because there was a fairly conspicuous package that was delivered there and in fact as you noted in the book the the the uranium the\nThe radioactive part of it but the element of was carried on to the ship in a briefcase but there was a lot of these stories that were told about what might be in their right though Sarah\nOh yeah I mean again these are teenagers and they have this\nLarge crate that delivered which is really a diversion to everything but they brought you know they see this crate come aboard and it's surrounded by marine guard\nAnd of course there first gas is Rita Hayworth undergarments or scented toilet paper for Douglas MacArthur [laughter] you know [laughter] no one guest anything close to the bottom [laughter] you\nKnow I thought it was a a an odd post scripts or that the ship itself got blamed in the court marshal they were a thrashing around to blame somebody into shifted self got blamed a and all of which you would like to tackle that\nWell they were in effect blaming Indianapolis for her own own demise so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship\nSo they were saying that that was kept them and they followed that with the ship fault for getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out\nI'm also as a treaty cruiser as Sarah mentioned she had a single three to back that went uh all the way through a from ... stern and\nEnded in certain cruising conditions in the in the button that creeping condition the multiplier tight creeping condition that through back then segment off by water tight OK ed and hatch is\nBack in order to cruise and hot how to take a cruise in a slightly different condition which with what's called yolk modified and not let some of those kids I'm not the old or in other words not water tight to win the battle with blown off the ship\nAnd she was continuing to make way through the water the with just flowing in three that that a long three attack and so um\nThere were a lot of questions in the court marshal about why that was the case why she why she would open like that and because of that because of this question because of their reporting on those questions kind of the families who had last man on the shed a blamed kept the next day even keeping that three deck open when\nStandard procedure\nWill try to get one more

successful and respected investigative project the missing for one one series of books\nAnd a documentary film by that title in fact ... was here last month to talk about the latest in that series use broaden his uh his Web is net and his uh focus again on the popularity of those books has overshadowed his original project the one that got him on the path to pursuing missing persons cases\nTen years ago next month they made his first appearance on this program with me to talk about the ... project\nA groundbreaking investigation into the big mystery in which Dave applied many of the techniques and strategies he learned as a police officer\nWho the sasquatch legend immersed himself in it lived among the group of people of northern California unemployed the talents of a forensic sketch artist give accurate portrayals of what people have been seeing for very long time\nWell you may have been focusing on missing or one one the last few years but never lost interest in big foot so here he is with a new work gets an archive of big foot and wild man stories news reports dating all the way back to the year's sixteen eighty\nAnd well I think David is probably not likely to take a position on what the answer to the mystery might be he has pulled together a pretty amazing collection of reports from eyewitnesses newspapers journalists hunters and others who've seen these creatures up close and personal ... welcome back\n[noise] hey George thanks again for having me\nA absolutely no good times on the show and I appreciate it\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a it's kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years and focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like they were when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big
