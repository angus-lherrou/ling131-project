I\nDon't belong to any particular religion because where I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who\nAre agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything any ways we can personal clarion so I wasn't touching anybody any ways really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know some times are already in the homes from time to come into the home the sense of family\nThat's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional the habit cleared out ones and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nThat are qualified extra assistant just about every religion\nBut they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know a local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working past lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe I said before on on one of my appearances the universe is teeming with life

well as we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nAre both a just a few years ago um I did a three nights a\nStand essentially a legitimate haunted mansions and it's very famous I won't mention the name but um it's something I was against\nFor years and years and years for fused all invitations I finally uh they talked me into no said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just they're beautiful you know and ah so ah it was essentially set up for ... to go in and uh with real quick\nAnd then in and take a look around and everybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know one couple said their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nAh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy gold she was called the gold room\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just\nWould not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know\nThis place is really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't\nBite need yeah people home negative spirit's just they will get\nTo know that gets you later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and uh oh four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now\nI'm used to know spirits can assume any shape they won so I don't react to the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\nOr what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's drain possible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil law by\nAnd it was right above me and and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song\nSlowly and I just I you know ...\nShot up immediately got up out of my bed and ... it kinda went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I had to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after her night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a sneaky using and sat down and they're\nNot out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just sell to lose\nAn extra shift is not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople face so I I go completely on the client I did report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely on the clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away or you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know in\nTimes immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere Skype telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals that just work in a negative environment\nAnd they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting\nI feel better at work I'm Better able I go into business meetings and no longer coming out feeling dreamed because they're not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them or a negative spirit\nAnd so you know people call me families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller an email\nThanks a lot Jeffrey you're really really helped you know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last almost three decades now have not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do\nAnd I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things in forty five\nMinute already find different things so remarkable and you it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing as different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or around ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up\nYou know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on\nA business or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family lore arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy a track negative spirits demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I did and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep ...\nYou mean that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy and also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to\nIts old very youthful but I mean think of the moon energy dinner\nElated and so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy regenerated you don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session it all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes for a standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good luck Nick some costs just for you you know most\nAll energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to C.

defend themselves\nWhich unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues physical brain problems [noise] a depression anger issues unhappiness\nA overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that providing lime and being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right\nUsually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly and they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of\nDug but actually been working on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up one morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work or doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew it I could feel its power suddenly light shot out from it hit me right in the back and it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some medication for it\nBecause the demonic spirit had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is the\nYou know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things\nThe non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was in her negative very negative what we might call help and and essentially that is very connected to the physical realm maybe the physical\nSomething like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to Jim in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirit to quit being evil or you know to trip pan turtle like I go to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychic back in the Nineteen Ninety is asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra systems and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help spirits and I said what I say now I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to see they're still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for these spirits\nOut there that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are hope with but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy field I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore to a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy and the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's disaster anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack or not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or ... or ... whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual to save this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't there are other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I am I was born with it and at first it was really scary 'cause when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm a mom for that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stop at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kind of things in past life helping people that to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work\nBut the idea is is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so drained\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they loved it\nYou know and it it's just great to hear them say

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and the voice of elusive tree but\nAfterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr poor in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has and consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream\nSure she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on the mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ...

the lake and reached out to grab another stick\nAnd and pulled out a three foot long sort out of the out of the mud\nJeez yeah yeah yeah and you\nCan see it and the number to spot in the carousel as I said it's huge and ... and it turns out uh they they called local museum they examined it and the sword is at least a thousand years old and it may predate the Viking a\nMarch gosh maybe it's one of the sorts from Arthur who knows huh [laughter]\nYeah so the joking that she the she's the new queen of sweet and perhaps perhaps uh uh and\nAnd the other great story we got on the website and you gotta like this well a lot uh I I think you're familiar I'm sure you are with accordingly ferry\nBoat I Love that for a while it's one of my favorites and when I was a kid I thought that I was amazed by they look like little cut outs but you're just not quite sure\nYeah yeah absolutely and\nAmazingly ah I'm not sure how they pat down you know got passed down through the years 'cause either from the Nineteen ten but they went up for auction last week in England or two of them and amazingly these ah these photos\nThey thought they were going to go for about nine hundred to Thirteen hundred

our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits\nAre but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThat work on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional\nEnergy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses and\nAnd that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that ... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energy is which are unseen but we feel about them\nAnd they accumulate is in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they uh uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them\nWash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy it thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises in different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent police\nSay sharman priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic atheist\nEverybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church the call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clarion so I wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years depending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know sometimes there are already in the home sometimes they come into the home the sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it's it's best to call maybe a professional to have it cleared out ones\nAnd I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nOr and also how to maintain the clarity of their living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nUh that are qualified extra system just about every religion but the ... but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that I that people call up and say well I I called you know a local perished\nNo no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me I Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of working as live um I I did contact with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with SARS around those stars or planet and our universe before on on one of my parents' university teeming with life you asked me that question\nTo know do do you go into these ... with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working with Christians which hold me all the time or even evangelical
