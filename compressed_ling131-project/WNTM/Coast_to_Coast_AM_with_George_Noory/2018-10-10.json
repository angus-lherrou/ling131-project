little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition tell us just a cycle couldn't he says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nI think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\nYears ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they'd show videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired a they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nWell that's the type of technology that is being used in present meant experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work now psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm\nConsciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and I think the most compelling studies that had been controlled or one again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton\nUniversity which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea the studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is this ability for the mind ... matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out heroes and one in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is asked people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room so they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more one rose\nAgain what do we find is that they're at the mall but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in people do people have that ability or have\nThat's right George ... those may or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the ... study where these machine the random number generators\nWere set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done it looked at the behavior of the machines around the world around event that we know\nA produce heightened emotion and nine eleven as one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically in a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events what do we find that there was a spike\nAt nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers\nBefore the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr a yellow her you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for ... she had the ability to bend spoons keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who said doll etched trickery its magic\nBut do you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and a candidate B. taught\nCan cycle ... be taught\n\nWell I've heard of of Boone bending parties which sounds ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind in a way to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator which actually\nBending metal for example and early ... is an

I include in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending within the context of remote viewing mhm bellies and what they say and

strength\n\n[noise]\n[noise] welcome\nBack Marc ... with us we'll get to your calls as well this hour mark the near death experiences again and we were talking about whether the brain hallucinates\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into that tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nYeah I'm Glad you brought this up short they're really really important one because if if there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was the nation perhaps it gets into a window into\nA reality that we typically don't even our eyes I I think we should've or this one further my perspective on it after having a look at the evidence to me the most compelling evidence are the cardiac arrest studies known at ... cardiac arrest studies is where people have\nAre in cardiac arrest ... hated and the experimenter as talk to them soon after they're able to sit after they've had the experience rather than ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago that either\nOh just for example Dr ... a ... from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest come back and describe this near death experience and why is that significant\nIn cardiac arrest this is severe physiological trauma in many cases the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stops after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later I'm One example in particular is\nFrom Dr Sam ... in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen one of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it\nWas later found to be the defender later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound and yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body Intel's the attending doctor exactly what he heard and it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experienced and memories\nAre but what I found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities in markets than the room\nYou can't see those radio signals what's they're out there is that a little bit ... with this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat is such an important point\nI think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary\nA perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes Shoah a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum and what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality\nSo I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us that are existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible drama on this topic you've learned a lot damage you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid at Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational a gift and I materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going I just think regarding and the\n... uh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there is no God or no devil\nI Would call it an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I wouldn't call it may be seeing you ... you know space no time\nA dimension but my question to you is specifically I liked it\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about side medications all explained psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers ...\nEffect chemically the brain and therefore they do affect\nChemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain through these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches\nThe going back to psych made it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mine that's my first part my second part of this saying one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain or does it affect the conscious is the minds does thing that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that\nIf the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there's a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or\nIf someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation what I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise] imagine you have a fire\nLots of firefighters show up\nYou have a larger fire\nMore firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with a grain of highly related to consciousness you damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected but the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver\nWhich similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen what do you think mark of reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nFor it we we've had some incredible stories to people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's the chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nI'm In er sometimes there are five by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past\nIt's life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm

work in my work I've often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks on ... with water which\nIn yes okay I've seen it work the at work and then seeing the drillers calm and drill right to that same a debt and there it is ...\nAnd ... you know again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that there is this something there that we don't fully understand\nAnd then can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that ah the Dow is er and I've seen that with three different methods brass rods\nWillow sticks and tendons over a map mhm okay I'll watch pendulum over a map which was the most strange is one of all that somebody could could could find water and yet there it is up comes to water [laughter] so\nAre is the Dow is there a particularly sensitive to the uh electromagnetic flux than the earth caused by the water moving through various layers of conducting semi conducting insulating properties\nWho knows when she had the scientists we ... we in science cannot ignore this cannot ignore the going all the way back the your guest mentioned William James okay\nAll that whole period when all of this a lot of his early early research started into shall we say ... ... ... and other other sorts of things and I I I mean I've never seen the U.S I've never seen what I could call you up all night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI saw when I never did before but I saw\nYou know so I Can't I Can't even put up all this stuff that has to do for instance a desert tortoises will show up at the mud hole the desert tortoise in the southwest will show up at the mud hole prior\nTo when the rain comes within within just now maybe that's something to do with the change in the air pressure and they know but yeah\nThey can feel it it's a it's they're reading something but to the to the to to to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal look pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on her way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works\nI don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution to even talk about these things\nI've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and put the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits\nThere's something very strange going on even know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglement\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have to particle two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another\nAnd when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect which suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness ... Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light what the faster than anything the travel\nAnd yet here we have an instantaneous connection between ... articles that there are things in the ... of reality that are totally counter intuitive\nBut we just don't see them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\n\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do like ugly this it opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which it we're all connected and helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that it has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nAll right my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought your website and where people can get your book and into upside down thinking\nThank you George my website is mark Goldberg dot com and they are K.

them now the name of the book by wrong collecting Maureen would more goes chronicles stories from the wrong with the unknown the unexplained and the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic tranche medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the deceased shut the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Maureen under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to doubt only understand but also control this gift of the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and his accompanied the group on more than one hundred investigations\nHere she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nThank you so much for having me we could afford to this Fifteen Years old all this happened for you\nYeah I Know as you're reading that and thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of Salem\n[noise] you know he's very wonderful woman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was barely renowned in the city and she still is\nOn it now and it's you know the high ... salmon and often when I was younger you are walking around town you know threats and her her guide and very regal looking very on you know she ... president of ... and ... at\nThe time did people welcome or with open arms or did they go oh my God there's a which\nYeah that's a great question you know there are many people that welcoming her with open arms but\nLet's just say the town and Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seems to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town of Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously they tore them right now I ... in it you know go to town on so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ...\nNow you are a fifth generation psychic trance medium that means we're talking about we back to your family is head disability what year are who did it start with\nNo ... and it's interesting because growing up my mother never really wanted to I don't understand why scare me should get you know my father though he thought the girls in the same um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that with these\nBeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she's normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in their sixties she finally told me that she is you don't want Maureen\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and do readings for them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio\nSo would\nYou see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew her\nUm but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so\nIt's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by and my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDo they ever passed dome stories from one to the other the food you could you read through\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and ah I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was maybe\nMaybe five years before she passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know\nThat was her true so she was very unique about what she said so that the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say\nI'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me\nTo tell the story but he started this story after I'm a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um\nYou know a special court for class and he took to try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness I'm and basically he started doing a cable um\nYou know he started cable program and during that cable program he didn't have to do it on something so he chose you know doing on go set his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus\nOn but it's a team of individual that\nYou know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really\nYou know it's a great team of people you work really hard together you'd go out and you look for things that go bumper the night you know someone else doesn't really want to to want to look into that they're quite\nSatisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run and the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain and um people were getting a little freaked out and they need help\nSo it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigation so people it's really going there to to just help them\nHow many people are just so off the wall when you go to their house and they're just using that\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nYou know show [laughter] sure why his birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know\nAs as it says we've done more than a hundred and investigations um I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time but we're big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise]\nUm so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it [noise] um so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of\nParanormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience and my experience over the years has been you know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or\nMaybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass 'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just\nDie as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs\nOn you know all these out she'd have something go on in the oven she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in soil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look and the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all that just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent nice\nWhen you look at the resumption of the

miss anything so I I just thought they waited for ... I saw her continually walk all the way to do it\nAnd I waited and waited and yet\nNobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there but yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk in\nAnd yet there was no one there and oddly enough\nThat ... is where the coast got because it's on the coast guard base a coast guard reported seeing women walking on the wall in that same location so that was\nKind of intriguing I'm ... and perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we did a public or goes on ah\nWhat Iowa lighthouse and benefit pool meals main we're in the White House ah keep U.S House it was on the\nUm renovation at that time we were sitting on a picnic table in the in a room off the kitchen I look towards the kitchen I saw a dog will crush the door or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the the there was no\nThere's no sign out so I jumped up and meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd when the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to the woman and she says why would you see and I just had our dog she says the to describe not so sure absolutely as far as clear as day and I describe that she just\nStood there and shook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know Ron there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved to leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so I Would die lighthouse keepers afterward\nTook care of him till the dog ... died in ...\nI don't she says the dog you described pretty much matches\nBecause he has a dog that that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean his two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it's certainly saw it would appear to me as a ...\nMinute still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring Maureen back and both of you are old will take phone calls next on coast to coast am runs website of course is linked up the coast to coast am dot com and their latest book is called more ghost chronicles and\nFind out more about tonight's guess log on to go to ... dot com\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute\nThe earnings reporting season is set to pick up fast and all this the biggest name on the earnings calendar for today and ... intelligence says the company likely benefited from the robust manufacturing economy Delta Airlines Walgreens report tomorrow and some big banks open their books on friday\nSo blonde Cato of London burned Salma ...

take your phone calls as well more goes chronicles Maureen say hello to run\nA Ron how're you doing she never touched me in the morning there you go [laughter] so how often\nDo you get the calls Ron for ghost investigations\nYou know it it it's funny when we first started we we course it was quite common but there are so many groups out like when I first started I always say that was\nA twenty ... you have to do was knew that was like twenty four in the country though is like twenty four and a nice city but the judge I did want to mention you mentioned the hurricane Michael does just that image know of the ... the center right now has dealt with it I don't know if you've seen that yet or\nNo I haven't seen that yeah ... it's pretty that's you're already is our number ... ... dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring them down from four to nothing so that would be good [laughter] I think we've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do anything because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of particular area you might want to concentrate your audio recorder serve\nIf for a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you ... you have to have a little bit of it I Try to get too much into the details with tour of the coin is for like ... or\nAre you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for a new strictly investigate\nThat the popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know you know what were they doing you know they're not going they're releasing spirits and you know those are things you to hear from people but\nYou know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know that they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want that goes dot of there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know basically a you know what you expect from us in\nA in a very of the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clinton's itself but we're not going to do it though you know or are we from someone else um but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls for both of you let's go to brandy and granted big California Welcome to the program I brandy\nHuh hey thank you for taking my call and say\nUm [noise] yeah I had a question and I've had a really really rough year after year I'd probably the worst

that's for sure yet [laughter] yes it was\nUm okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of ... um and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding on to a lot of hurt that have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but\nYou know and the other kind of coal is no this was last year now are things that have been happening is like a pressure right though because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I Would tell you is that you can get to a better place\nYou really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that\nI hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you um and it's time for you to grow and you have to be able to to try that it's not going to be this way all the time\nAnd I know that might sound cliche but I'm calling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying I'm\n... but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day routine to really try and you put on the math but you're not feeling it\nIs that correct or no [noise] uh right [laughter] yeah okay right\nSo put ... think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a hailing hand that you have and I used to me you have to

missed\nWhat it's going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story for going on for ages with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy Bernie's\nBook so there was no separate income stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you gotta have the ads you gotta have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people were kind of regret it given what's going on but sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now\nThis breach that occurred ... of the right at the top\nAh they currently found out about this for a month ago\nThey should have publicly about that at that time [noise] apparently there is that they really didn't if they found that in a during a if I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it ever been exploited in other words it was a theoretical bought her ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were\nUm theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers do financial information nothing like that while that stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's\nSo much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation and they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kind of makes it a convenient I won't say excuse but ... it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting a demotion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about pet month but they they should have\nDiscussed that publicly of the first place\nUm and uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who've been using Google Plus all these years or try to find other places to go where experimenting with other things\nAnd I mentioned that there the Google commercial version of cocoa puff which operates further Gees wait the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month or per head\nUsing it that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially [noise] uh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf was probably not a good idea and the first place\nThat's a time at ... at the end at the\nTime that it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that an enormous growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear Snapchat is going broke where do you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems I guess their stock has been a wall up\nYeah that's a very well uh their their founder has been I go out there you know kind of messages to the troops to kind of try to cheer them up [noise] uh it it it appears that some pretty serious mistakes were made along the way when they when they tried to
