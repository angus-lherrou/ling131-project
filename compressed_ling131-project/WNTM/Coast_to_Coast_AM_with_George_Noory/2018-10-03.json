S. are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats another room and the other way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty are six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide\nIt's our water is is a is not where it ought to be but the great lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe at the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is may come back as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining\nSo this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively um can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in a worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah yeah it\nIs kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at the grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October\nIn a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will and fight a climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible of man made climate change and that we do have a greenhouse effect but over the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles this the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nKept slowly there are\nEarth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of which cycles which are uh the tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages\nThen we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that uh scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are the they fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when it was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were witches and they were causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycle so the and the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign up now for ... zone or free email newsletter get it today at ... dot com\nThis is a Bloomberg market's been at\nThe job market will be in focus on Wall street for the rest of the week a D.

Streever wrote a book called the coming global superstorm and that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was\nOr is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what these predictions\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with yellow stone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the ban in both of those movies that very well happen [noise]\nYeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve is Yellowstone and that full Cain although I understand there's a big went under there\nYou have to call during the day after tomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming would would\nStop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nUh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific the the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us in the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there\nUm to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the\nNo the gulfstream wasn't slowing down and really not happening\nThere was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nOh they'll make you\nStill don't think whoa okay go ahead John\nYeah but in order to uh to quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking about\nWind bills when I\nWhen I was living in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind will that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat\nAnd it was up by plenty more ... boots lame you know they were were burning off the methane gas\nWell we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know electricity now come back and they said no no no it's going to cost ... can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that\nAnd they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go why hasn't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places they're capturing the gas from landfills\nA but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi George and thank you for having Steve von Loor bumped into spoken to him several times are hurting on any shows and he has a breath of fresh air and inside and that\nAccuracy a there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends she\nNot to make the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are are are using a ...

I'm Sorry two billion ... it's quite a few of those are those are the United nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day\nOr we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four dollars a day and and then I come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or a ... a\nA young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said\nThey're more willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what frosty has told us is this your second shift in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massively improve their lives they're doing All right with out as this last we will rich a lot of them are are turning illegally into this country because they had been tricked and seeds into thinking they're\nJob market indicators will get a lot of attention for the rest of the week ... as a matter of life tells Bloomberg Radio the government's employment report but likely add more evidence that the economy is doing well\nWe're very high levels of consumer confidence the I asked them that it looks really really good the labor market data over the last couple of months there's been a really good and it's expected there remained good has tried to\nA D.

levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to\nTo NASA uh their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age no scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm\nRight now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm\nUh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast but the ... that used to be a big court or a big uh port on in in a northwest\nItaly an excuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher\nBut again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise will matter what the what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us ... go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps to a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and done what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations and news articles scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and they've been ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky and they no doubt this a lot of cameras\nHarp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it first of all\nTime you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factored why you're not seeing the real Noah weather satellite maps that we used to the many years ago where see an animated cartoon but there's a site I it's a YouTube one\nIf it redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologists he keeps on him is his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm front hurricanes tropical storm low pressure zone coming directly into California and they're being blocked\nAnd it's being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can put out as much as three billion watts of power in the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricane they can start hurricanes\nThey can blast under head they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not\nAn act of nature it's an act\nOf the military industrial complex would have in our with our weather\n... when I hear about it and the new Luskin Steve's reaction to that Bruce like you\nSaid some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead [laughter]\nWell is it going man just did it exactly right I Want to these conservative it happens to believe\nThat the way to address is being gay oh engineered the came trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on his show\nTalking about can't drill team put out a video called Franken's guy and the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the body out son\nWhere people are so much shoes were hate about the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off became trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geoengineering this weather\nDown to a science I mean it's to the point now where you can go to Wall Street and bet\nOn the stock market on the weather if they want or against that they want to intensify the hurricane through the age of heart and now on top of that then you got the geo engineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything\nNow I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea that may never come up with man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing that Trump I'm proud of him he got us out of the climate accord 'cause it's a sham men they want they were doing is gripping the oil industry all nations away distributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China here with her sky completely online with pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to point oh eight oh now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time Steve

break on us\nYes yes oh well this gentleman was a canoeing in a creek\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee so he's watching this thing going up and down and thinking to themselves what on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river\nAnd when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there were like low boroughs ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it and went to climb down\nWe couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention\nWhen he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and won't position and staring at him so now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it lowers down again well moments later\nHe sees some law flinging the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy\nComing along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one\nCarrying the other one who knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something to play with the kids in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a\nUnited sooner aren't and rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story a\nInvolving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business uh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the risk of New England combined\nAnd Ninety percent of it is on inhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness\nHere in New York state [noise] and so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine [noise] uh the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them well gardeners they will gardeners\nThis was like a match made in heaven well as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of using the gardening tool\nThe wife is saying that I was born with a shovel wisdom rate was this so finally the husband get the idea that they're going to gather together with the tools they have to an inventory\nAnd then they were going to keep them all locked up with the exception of two small hands space\nSo having accomplished that they really have a missing some tools\nAnd they started they leaped to hand spades\nOn what she called the the wife called the stroke table on the patio and they were using them for partying plant\nAnd\nNo sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn they it actually called the police report in depth on the property of you know tools and this and that\nNumber and understand who would come on their land and take tools\nAnd take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel\nYou're going to Rob the place Rob the place well [laughter] bright he bees and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods\nThey found one of the shovel leaning on the tree and the wife dope doubt nine feet off the ground one of the one hand garden trials with a rubber handle on it showed into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up show they went back to doubt they got a I guess an iPhone or something took pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't Bush drifting buried in a tree several inches couldn't budget [noise] so they had recalled the police and\nTold them the story about finding the shovel in the woods showed the cop shoveling the tree and everybody was baffled by you know the turn of events you\nAnyways the long and short of it was\n\nThe cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives\n[noise] well I said the long and short of it was a couple of days later they came outside\nAnd the guardian behind the house\nHad been trampled down there were huge footprint in bed or tomatoes were taken the head of lettuce one mashed\nAnd whatever had done this which was obviously a big foot\nI stepped right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just step pride over the warrior winning had it's full of feed\nAnd then left they recalled\nThe uh the police over to see what had happened that transpired and he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports\nPeriodically of people saying they show these big ... creatures coming in their property of walking now so it\nIsn't it's convincing\nYeah it's not like it's not like these

North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting\nUh I had an account was told to me by all things a Russian professor who was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of this vast knowledge of things but time nickel and they form this unlikely friendship\nAnd turned that into a hiking partnership\nAnd they had run across a couple of big for its\nMessing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor\nSaid that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with no this is a Russian speaking immigrant saying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with\nSo when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman it's hard not to think of the land bridge that was one step above the Bering Sea\nAnd did these things or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nA speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees they heard them ... and they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant\nAnd they're shouting orders back and forth to each other so it's very very odd but as far as the uh the uh uh yeah any any abominable\nBelow snowman I have no idea uh\nI have a Sanders since ... book the abominable a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading uh an encyclopedia on the creature a and yet\nGetting back to what I said earlier none\nOf this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about Bigfoot or a hoax the film is a hoax oil\nOr the or a a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so

couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls incident but one night I'll share with you a ... was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys ... we're working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania\nTo do a weekend of survival training or on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being saved so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words held than SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making Smokey fires using a green a green bows and that night they decided to go on a night hike\nTo see what it was like a\nNavigating around in the dark a now during the day they had climbed up\nThe sides of the mountains to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation\nAnd they had gone up into the same area or at night\nFor the ICC well when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was it you will fall when the ... which was\nVery bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision a by knock you lose your own mind I'll kill or a that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail\nOne of the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern but then they realize that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them there's just no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in orbit around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it\nThey could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming aiding the trees around it\nSo that the parents who was that bright\nYeah I mean it it it's a glowing orb of light darting around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world [noise]\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's still something really weird he described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball\nA two foot wide beach ball he describes a globe ... coming out of the size of this thing\nAs being like when you blow a bubble through want as a child okay\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this or and making its way down to the ground [noise] and what blew their mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times for thirty times the volume of the orbit self\nAnd yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they don't want to see a big foot appearing in this secondary glob coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation that wasn't moving whatsoever but they were certain to what
