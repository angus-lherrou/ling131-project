life Fifteen Years later you maybe\nIt depends on how powerful the individual is\nOkay and then um as far as uh uh uh I don't know what to on the idea of energies shopping or something I've noticed that ah in myself when I feel kinda awkward and uncomfortable or around people if I think of myself as sort of a a lighthouse generating not visible light\nBut then for red warm you know and uh you know not so as to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy\nEither way either ... direction I mean he was on or off\nWhen he was on a lot of people love to be around him when he was off a lot of people wanting to\nBe away from it was amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up we're gonna rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey roll and thanks for calling\nMorning our way today\nWe are fine thank you hope you are to\nOff Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local like\nI'm not far from where I live probably within an hour has friends come over\nThe person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I had just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well now he goes well you might as well get up and\nMove around on others as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction\nAnd hung out with people for a little while and uh they all wanted to go to a bar probably how no maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there\nAnd uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into the bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar well focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck stuff about\nLike a bar full of empires from something here exactly as like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or at the swatter bright and sign up on a rope or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not very long ago I Need to go\nSo they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old dad gummed seating bar yeah and I went in there with\nThem and to this place and it was a bunch of old\nPeople that there again I felt that often that's in the air and\nUh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they've found comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I worked with him um and uh yeah there are to me it doesn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and they finally decided well come on let's go well we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know\nA were off on the farm and the caller won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us on the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum so they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk\nSo I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything and I think that was you know\nPart of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening\nAnd the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people in and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name leaders are\nDoing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer and it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up her where\nShe looked at me and I was an honoring a word she says are you pray him and I says yep [noise] and she goes we better\nShe knew one looming up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead\nAnd I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb where we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that bothers the lord and Jesus in my heart\nWould you have these dreams your mind about nothing\nIs going to be stronger than the the like to send me\nWhat do you think that ... role in what do you think their game was what were they trying to do\nA lot I don't know maybe trying to um where they were somebody and do um\nWhere they're going to kill you\n[laughter] I don't think so no I don't I don't think so but I think they may have been trying to\nUm when me over somehow or another 'em\nLike they wanted your soul\nIt was weird I I had talked to this only to my therapist one other time but I definitely felt an odd present I'm I'm very uh intuitive anyway\nAnd uh it just something that struck me as odd\nI Hope you hang around with them any other time [noise]\nUh no actually you know I don't really run into one of them since then and uh they're still around but I'm a while it was weird\nYou gotta you gotta be careful lotta times you

I was four she started taking me to funerals so that I could talk to the relative that died and Italian ...\nEverybody's related somehow and so you know I was grandma special granddaughter they could come in and talk to the dead\nThe only thing and I was never scary to me I mean the person would just standing there and yeah I could see his body and the gasket but he was he was talking to me and uh you know there was no question but would ask the question\nOr the relative would ask the question what they want her to know and I did not have to repeat it because the ghost heard it but they would just give me the answer and then I Would tell whoever ask the question the thing that scared me George and all of this was\nI'm definitely old enough but that back in the day they had ... and these\nYoung did they did hire people who cried and everything else\nOh and carried on they did everything but wrong the floor that scared the ... to me it wasn't the dead person as the live person

I think that the older I got\nThe easier of course it was I think the more you do anything the easier it is and then in ... even though I've done this for so long I still learn stuff all the time and

I learned how to keep it open long enough\nAnd it was it was a learning thing you had to learn how to do this and it was trial and error because I really couldn't ask anybody about it and as crazy as this sounds our youngest daughter ... can do this\nAnd but she doesn't do it my way because she does not want to see the people in our eyes she just wants to hear them so everybody does it differently

that has happened\n[noise] I ... this past year has been unusual and um I was afraid of one thing oh maybe twenty\nFive thirty years ago that happened a a ghost actually flipped and a red handled acts in front of my face\nAnd and I wouldn't houses if I thought a ghost can kill me I Am certainly not stupid but\nI remember I was in the garage and that acts hit the concrete floor and slid into a fiberglass garage door he had no idea how loud that was when that hit\nAnd it was the three steps into the house from the attach garage and I remember sitting on the top sitting down and going maryann what are you doing here [noise]\nAnd then it dawned on me knock it off because all I'm going to do is give them more energy I Can't walk into a house and be afraid because that's what they don't eat they don't sleep they need human energy I'm not going to feed them\nAnd I ... and the bottom line is your dead nominal live I've got a step over you bud and you know I Can't grab throw you into the
