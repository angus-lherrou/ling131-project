N. D. M. [laughter]\n\n\n\nNicorette burned there's some great stories in the book the monsters monster book um and some of them like lizard man I remember reporting blizzard man as a as a newscaster back when those stories were unfolding in seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something to put somebody in a costume or\nA ... an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell them this book about something called the wind man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so I Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a woodland far Iceland\nAnd I'm like sitting places around the world that seem to be to the hot spots for paranormal phenomena the kind of chase he's just saying you know they become known as window areas where it seemed to everything in its brother come through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post and somebody had same this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or if soaring would be a better term to use over the woods a at a high speed um you know kind of a like a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... it in that respect than there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them even spoke to the local police so I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have the spy too weird activity in this area which he's all ready notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog man and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nAnd and share rates and that's what I Do I put the diatribe for people to say I mean if I got out and says what's healthy we probably don't have on says I'll tell them you know they should they should just say ... or ... or or possibility um [noise] you know I'm not going to tell people they're big forty some strange creature that\nCome from the far side of the moon which I don't believe it day by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\nWell yeah the the the ... is he's a really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up he's not seen again I'm just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people are like one and it was back\nAnd then he's never seen again but um this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pull Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my ... on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed\nUm he saw these strange creatures while he was driving along the road\nAnd it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings\nBut it was kind of ... as well [noise] excuse me and had the shining a yellow eyes but they sort of the ... the hair angle combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of\nPeople said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like\n... ... and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these you know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I'm Talking about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mistreating and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nWell I've got to be honest with you in Georgia I'm doing five books now I'm On this phenomena foreign the men in black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI NSA\nAnd uh you know nothing like the the concept in the movies it basically are described as looking\n... you know go on and skins why why why I'm I'm people talk about I actually have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nBefore they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them by full and shake afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black and turned up in homes right after painful thing using wager boats which puts another angle to it\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um you know they should have real phenomena but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a gothic horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues to get back [noise] that's how I Would sort of describe fish but many black mistreat it Bobby on you know just guys in a black suit walk\nAnd I guess I'm you know\nI'm asking it into context sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans and helicopters are that some of 'em are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seem like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction files but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nOr pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the cat will be the tuition is you know you got a really weird one and actually a couple and then some which are easier perhaps to explain\nThere is a parallel with the men in black but you know but in some cases I think the government agencies are responsible for the paper I think it's a very small couch agree\nThe January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support\nIs over the years agencies may actually unemployed elections are demanding black as a means to cover their tracks in other words it might have within government you know that many black to radio but\nI don't know what they are but it doesn't prevent them from using the legend that most have resumes too quiet people who\nMay not want to have him talking about cases so the government might actually not know how to marry a black really are and I don't think they do fully\nBut that sort of leads us into where we're heading in the next hour we're going to talk about top secret alien abduction files what the government doesn't want you to know that ... latest book\nOr whether or not you believe the abductions are real the files on nearly abductions are real when I tell ya what might be going on there based on some of the or real life or documents that

George finds hassle\nTrue and bathroom ... all of them how to FBI falls out putting on the one of the mind raise in Spain was because they claimed when I'm ... by the FBI\nBut yes they ... they are and see Israeli and but they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or government is very different so I was ... and bordering on\nCommunism and I'm so that really opened the eyes\nOf the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file\nUm he's extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia dams gays is about a hundred and fifty pages I'm ... was about four to and so on so you know we have a precedent\nFor the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties things really kicked off I'm with the abduction phenomenon in September sixty one\nI'm with the bacteria and Bonnie hill case which is I guess is the defining moments you follow gee when\nIt wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey now in the story of basketball and hail that coming back from a a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky and then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail rights\nThey you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weighed dreams and nightmares of being taken on board\nThe strange craft would they be strange creatures and being subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly striking is that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man\nWho was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am\nAn essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the vehicle interference phenomenon with a new holiday what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation\nBecause they report to the to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused coal they promised the security services are sort of like they the James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved and espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they the they profit from the security services interviewed Ronald wild man by the same time to with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him\nAnd the most telling and intriguing aspect is that he told the police so they should have direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction law in today's world that Ronald while in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO calmed down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch\nAnd there was something about states it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of with bemused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um\nBut the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski then you realize that these guys telling these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realized that the government is\nReally does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and panel where the the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they conclude\nThe UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting UFOs might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion is that a justification for following around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nIt was a main Georgia ... is a first book flying saucers a blended published in the early fifties that that sold in huge Vegas gigantic numbers of books were sold\n'em and I have a ... went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type of governments um the communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on her down skate um\nPredominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens bucked the FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the\nA rock and roll lovers in Sandy

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] it gives me um [noise] no it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or\nYou know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right um people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of a privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really what how this book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this one movement in New directions by thinking about science and physics and cosmology and how it's sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to\nUm have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about their death experiences and and the variants isn't anything after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture\nYou mentioned in the beginning how a believer in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of ... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase\nThat that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began to book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes to believe in spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional ... with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about that how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust sense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the absence a really in the absence of\nParticipation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and trying to think well where where people getting these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi are so thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with offensive on mystery and wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the the bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists would die hard time to normally charged with\nToo late [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you use ... reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it's it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of\nWhy those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um that one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nI Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I can I ask the question what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about\nThat and maybe I can just say worried about that for them for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to have a\nAnother ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live and and that's linked with and height\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions but there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and I find I spoke about the but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space but different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of one dimensional object has length\nIf you then draw flap where on that same piece of paper it has to directions or dimensions that has length and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube and your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide\nAnd then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth mansion\nIn this be a you know this would be an object that has links with height and something else [laughter] and the the phone thing else as the tricky part something else is the\nIs the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive I'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others from philosophers I'm In the\nWay back to the Eighteenth century but really the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equation and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that at work um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions a fourth\nIt was mentioned that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant\nUm um and so on so and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um

S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made of that of that book but she talks about time slips um and and time travel um and so on and some of her books\nSo yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time is just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations on her own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past and in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions with Scott depending wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of blocking universe so I'm\nDone and all of his own laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies tackle all the time\nYeah you're right you're right they waste it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how freer to make choices um and so on\nHum so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it more plausible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self could somehow\nLift itself up above our\nThree dimensional world or I should say are four dimensional world right because we have three spatial dimensions in one temporal dimension dreaming stuff he said can lift up out of that block universe and peek into future\nOn them and don't believe that um you know you're in a bit of our time here and a bit of you know him thin and hire a lot for their um that's what he believed to happen and some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and we can talk about that as an additional facial dimension or we could talk about that is not maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he you know everybody\nEverybody's sleeping so had this degree of freedom and you also believe that every one of the cabin kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and they had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nYou believe that everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contained bits and pieces of future events and then I'm sort of mixed up together [noise] well\nI guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences\nTo talk about science is a showman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we discussed on this program before my fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions by Christopher white or we're going to take a break and be back in a moment David Gray sail away to listen to the break [noise]\nNo you can show up dates and connect with other coast fans would you joined the ...

expertise but we'll ask him\nYeah there I mean gun in his book on dreams doesn't really talk about uh preparing yourself at night although I think there are other\nFolks out there who've written books about how to remember your dreams who do actually you know\nSay things like you know talk to yourself at night before you sleep and tell yourself you're going to remember your dream from but I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down I'm as many details as you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice you'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrian Adrian sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journal and technique he said\nUm you know helps people remember more and more details as you go through the process so that that is pretty simple technique but there there are there are others out there who talk about um dream and dream interpretation\nThanks dug up going to take a call from a this is a first for me from volcano California the caller is Brendan got good morning Brennan\nMorning on your mind calling about is a sleep paralysis so\nI keep having episodes where I'm I'm I'm I'm just a little tidbit I'm suffered from insomnia so when I get on these rules but I don't sleep\nToo secular day very well seems like after about five or six days of this but I get on this trip or on falling asleep and my body's falling asleep in my in my mind's awake and I guess they call it sleep process but\nIt's almost like I go into a different universe\nAnd there's all we've seen that I see and usually are trying to get me and call me out of my body\nAnd not only that I hear them they talk to me so I'm I'm curious on what your thoughts are on is this just in the ... you know might just listen to any like Internet or wicked PTO was there the doctors will say or is this an actual dimension that\nDuring the state of my body is and I'm able to actually I don't want to say ... or ... you know something along that lines into that and it's very scary actually yeah yeah yeah right at all like\nYeah I think like I wouldn't call you rented let's let's let's Christopher respond thanks Bernard for the call so does sleep deprivation lead to other realities I Wonder\nYeah yeah um well he mentioned the words fleet paralysis and he also seemed to I thought I heard him say consulting doctors are we compete in there there is a category of sleep per hour from there are there are things that happened when people are falling asleep or waking up and we probably think this is\nGary ... is a very common\nYou know people wake up and they can't move um [noise] you know and it can I think I Believe that can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so [noise]\nYou know uh get the question is is is merely a\nA physiological biological um\nIssue or a problem um or is it somehow opening the spiritual world I guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is yeah these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness I'm\nYou know that they'll talk in terms of psychology and neurology\nBut um it it could also be\nUm an opening to\nOther realities of spiritual reality or maybe I don't know you know in some cultures um in some cultures you know people have visions um\nUh that that can be traced to you know brain chemistry or some sort of a sort of aspect of their of their biology or the brain chemistry but I don't think that rules out the possibility that you know their particular use your brain chemistry is\nIs it off or you know and it was white thank you very much
