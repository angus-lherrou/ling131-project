New York times with all this we don't know what it's going to be this coming week\nYou never know butts any we could all is a good weekend appreciate that [laughter]\nUm you believe a summing up the the jury in the Simpson case wasn't smart the judge was bad right across the prosecution was atrocious and as far as the so called dream team is concerned quoting from your book\nA quote in fact it was only the greater incompetence of the prosecution's say average bureau belly Scheck at all from defeat a house so [laughter] you really believe all that\nYeah not only not only do I believe it not only do I a legit but anyone who reads the book is almost compelled to go along with those conclusions because if there's one thing about me are uh uh that\nI never do I never make a charge without support in it and uh I I have a tremendous amount of support for everything and I say I don't just say something without giving four or five examples to support what I'm saying\nWhen I talk about the incompetence of the prosecution in this case it's page after page after page there's just no way that anyone can read this book or without coming to the same conclusion and it's because\nOf these revelations the shocking revelations of incompetence in in my book out rate that the word of mouth has been such that the book a shot up the number one of the country because\nHere too for the American people have been blaming the jury for this verdict and of course the jury was very bad uh don't get me wrong and I are on that at all very very bad\nThey many of them blaming the LAPD claiming the LAPD botched the case before I came to trial and but the main reason why this case was lost was the unbelievable and confidence that the prosecution in this case and you have to realize art I think you know my background I'm very\nPro prosecution no one in this country was more supportive of these prosecutors in Iowa throughout the entire case I mean I even sent them a telegram\nOn the morning and there's some Asian trying to pump them up but I had a um an option here either not to the book and I actually I was talked into doing it by my editor and I'm happy now that he did a or write the book and be candid and uh\nThis is a very serious charge that I make and against the prosecution in this case I supported in space that there's just no question about it ... on either incompetent\nWas up there and watched every moment of the trial a lost a lot of sleep over and I presume you pretty much dude as much as you could the same thing yeah did you sit there are sort of beating her fist against the wall about how well\nYou know I also got on radio and TV I kept a to a minimum but I got on radio and TV and said many of the things that I'm staying in the book now so this is that Monday morning quarterback but I get on radio and television and say they've got to offer some of the evidence is very very incriminating evidence to like it was a conventional type of evidence that\nLaypeople you don't even have to be very bright lay people have been consistently basing verdict guilty off for the past two centuries the type of evidence that\nIs automatically associated even by people rather low intelligence or with guilt DNA is very good evidence they'll get me wrong and I'm not criticizing the prosecution for preventing a DNA evidence in this case a but DNA is very complex very difficult to understand it and it was all an alien to this jury\nBut evidence like Simpson or taking off when he was being charged with these murders and they're finding in his possession of gun a passport a cheap the sky several fresh changes of honor of clothing and and and ... and Dr really a thousand seven hundred fifty dollars in cash on him\nWhich he proceeds to tell the place that Simpson had given him inside the bronco that type of automatically associated by laypeople up uh with guilt yet it was not offered to this jury they never thought of that evidence\n... speed stuff uh Dominic Dunn the respected writer has publicly stated why prosecutors didn't present that evidence he says through his sources\nThat he's aware of tape conversations of Simpson during the bronco chase where he's talking on a cellular phones sobbing and crying claiming to be an innocent man who framed is that why they don't use it\nIn the frame no no no not no no I'll Dominic is partly true there he was denying guilt a but big deal\nBig deal up it means nothing when someone is charged with murder and they'd be an ideal of course they're going to do I get off who in the world expects them to confess\nThat is the reason by the way that the prosecution did not offer that evidence nor did they offer a suicide note with absolutely reek with guilt I mean showing an innocent person charged with murder who would write a note like that so they were afraid of it\nWell that yeah but but but for the wrong reasons in the suicide note\nSimpson denies guilt to also the thirty two minute interrogation of Simpson the day after the murders rent a incidentally I have the I was able to get a hold in the audio that thirty come in and interrogation and I've transcribe it and it's in an appendix to the book is the only book on the Simpson case that has interrogation in it\nWhere he admits dripping with blood on the night of these murders has no idea how he got caught but in that interrogation ie awful denies guilt and the prosecutors you're right\nThey kept that out they kept that out all of that because they didn't ... this is what they said you can't make this stuff it's too far out to make up dark and says it in his book\nThey didn't want the jury to hear Simpson denying guilt without is taking the witness stand ... but aren't the jury already knew that Simpson had denied guilt I mean they knew he pled not guilty that's why they were having a trial for Pete's sake I mean\nIf the guy confessed if he had pled guilty there would not have been a trial you're going to keep out extremely ...\nAwful evidence like this or just to prevent the jury from hearing something that they already know that it's mind boggling and this was the mentality of these prosecutors good people the good guys lost here this is the mentality of these people were representing the state of the Simpson case and and people wonder why this guys on the golf course with a smile on his face\nYou're going to keep out for instance the passport the cheap disguise several fresh changes of honor clothing and the fact that our colleagues has all this money on him which Simpson gave him all this cash because he denying guilt because he's denying deal I mean the jury doesn't know that he's denying get why are they having a trial it's mind boggling\nI don't know what about the civil trial and all of this ... didn't come out in the trial will come out would not in the civil trial I can\nGive you a virtual one hundred percent guarantee that um the plaintiffs lawyers like Daniel Patrick ... whom I spoke to if they will be offering that evidence anyone would offer that evidence why these prosecutors didn't\nWhy they're so incompetent I don't know because I keep hearing that around the country why are they still incompetent why did they do this and I can't tell them I mean it's like asking me a wire Michael Jordan and Larry Bird dog a great basketball players I Can't tell you I can tell you that they are but uh the genesis of why they're so great uh I\nDon't know but yeah that\nEvidence will be offered like virtually any other prosecutor in the country would have done if they had handled the case that evidence will be offered during the civil trial and I'm very confident that there'll be a judgment against Simpson or or in that civil trial the question is whether he's already spirited there's money out of the country and they're gonna be able to like on the judgment that none of the real problem\nDuring and Clark both how to marry in your face kind of a presentation and a lot of people translated that to competence and they apparently didn't look a little bit deeper at some of the things we just talked about a with regard to the evidence not presented\nWell actually they were not in the face they should have been a lot more in the face they were much too casual a and laid back they were extremely casual and laid back they may have been a little in the face a outside the presence of the jury when they were talking to judge Ito in\nFront of a jury they couldn't possibly have have been more death for death\nImagine in your eyes what this guy's Simpson did to these two victims viciously stabbing him to death you know their life blood draining out of them the horror and the fright in their eyes the last moments when they were trying to survive imagined that now I imagine now imagine Marsha Clark during jury selection telling this jury\nWhile this thought on your mind that I just told you he is such a sympathetic guy okay and telling the jury this is not a fun place for me to be making this up this stuff in the transcript\nIf she tells the jury this is not a fun place for me to be art that's like telling the jury you know I really don't want to be prosecuting this guy but I have been assigned the case so what can I Do then she tells the jury\nOr you may not like me for bringing this case I'm not winning any popularity contest for doing so art psychologically nothing could be worse than to tell the jury that you're not winning any popularity caught as because if you're telling them that that's like telling them the majority of people outside that courtroom\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute stocks into roller coaster weaken positive territory the Dow gained two hundred eighty seven points the

you're saying something about his cutting himself in the fall and the media was saying that and they they made that assumption\nUh he did say something and they thirty two interrogation about going to the bronco to pick up a cellular phone he did not say he cut himself on a cell phone they asked them specifically how did you cut yourself his exact words the whole thirty two imminent interrogations in the book\nHe said I don't know later in the interview they asked him again how to get cut yourself and the exact words were I have no idea man so he is not the cut himself in the fall\nDuring a vaccine do the prosecutors try the tricks that you fault them for because they were dealing with the jury system that's made up primarily of sympathizers to OJ and people who are not quote average citizens in quote another words people who couldn't take 'em you know several months off work to attend to trial\nWell I don't really know what that means because uh if these people weren't the brightest people in the world with which you question them may imply that all the more reason why you offered conventional evidence like flight you know after he was being charged with these murders he took off the\nFact that he cut himself and has no idea how I got got cut the fact that he writes a suicide note I mean\nYou know when you're charged with murder or if you're innocent you're going to be blazing mad that you're being charged a desperately want to prove you're innocent find out who murdered the mother of two children instead he becomes very passive and he writes the farewell letter that really exactly like a suicide note\nUh your first comes off at the last person these things are incompatible with innocent so in answer to your question that's all the more reason why they should have offered these conventional uh items of evidence I'm not saying they should have offered DNA but not to the exclusion of these conventional\nEarning ... ... talking about DNA for a second all these other issues inside right I'm just an average person talk show host um but I understand numbers why didn't the DNA evidence alone convicted\nOkay now that again we get into absolute extreme uh uh uh incompetence here\nUm the defense every time every time they made an argument to explain away incriminating evidence the prosecution either did not respond at all which is virtually unprecedented or they responded in a very anemic fashion the main pieces\nOf evidence in this case other than that that tape but I just told you give me a hundred dollars and yellow pad I would've convicted him on that thirty two minute interrogation alone but the main item of evidence against Simpson was his blood was that the murder saying okay\nThere was blood on the ... gate\nA which was also his sound and later though yeah no no no no it was collected later not found later no it was it was it was seen that night by five detectors all of whom will testify not collected the night and that was not collect because then is following the criminal list and he did not pick it up that night and things like that happened that just incompetence two\nOff [noise] if farm and we're not involved at all in this case um they would have had them the defense would have had a more difficult time\nArguing the conspiracy theory and injecting race into the case but they would have found some way to do it uh although it would have been more anemic the prosecution would have had a greater likelihood of a conviction or without permits\nIs there any one thing you can think of that if you were to just pull it from the case would would have made it a slide the conviction\nSlide your sales law ... law\nNo no no because of this jury\nThe private\nLet me say this the prosecution\nWhen they present it scientific DNA evidence that Simpsons blood was found that the murder scene they did they did in fact prove Simpsons guilt beyond a reasonable doubt beyond all doubt\nBut we're we're we're dealing here with the jury that was not operating with too much intellectual firepower number one number too many of them particularly the black years were probably biased and Simpsons favor however here's the key point\nA powerfully presented tastes and summation which we didn't have here at all light years away from that where you put a bit on the jury and use spoons feed them can handle both of those problems but this was a problem jury no question about it and with the problem jury it's going to be difficult to get a conviction but you can do it you can do it\nWe're talking here about an F minus presentation and yet the first vote that this jury talk\nBack in that jury room people tend to forget this a black journey white German voted guilty on the first ballot that ... dollar an hour after the after the jury room if you can get a tend to with an F. minus presentation you can imagine by scrap elation what would've happened\nUh if you had an a plus performance which the people the state of California are entitled to I think almost assured\nLeaving a C a pardon even a C yeah\nYou'd have had a guilty verdict or at a minimum a hung jury that you'd have had problems with this jury unless you had an a plus performance the only type\nJury the only type a jury that you can't turn around art is the type a jury who state of mind is even though we know OJ's guilty or we don't care uh we like O. J. blacks have been discriminated against by white throughout the years we're going to give all day to free murders but let me tell you it would be extremely difficult\nTo find even one juror without outrageous state of mind much less all twelve\nAnd I'm looking at the backgrounds of these jurors for instance The Simpsons for person was a at the Nineteen Ninety LA county employee of the year I'm listening to what they said on radio and TV reading a book written by three of them I get no sense that even one of them had that state of mind and I don't believe that for one single moment so\nThis was not the best jury but they would have responded to an a plus performance what happened here is that the prosecution allow this jury to live with their conscience they did not eliminate for this jury all possibilities of sense of being found not guilty\nOr not the whole of the Rodney King business in the the riots and all the rest of the been hanging over this which was right or how much difference with that ...\nWell no question about it that affected the verdict but again again invariably we come back to the unbelievable incompetence of these prosecuting here's one Cochrane debt and it was duplicitous on his part it went right over the head of Darden who's the black went right over his head\nA Cochran argued to this jury\nA please spraying up from their experience of police brutality\nPolice brutality right and and frame of our two completely different types of misconduct dark never distinguish these two types and the jury's mind\nUh what the black community has been experiencing throughout the years from a small segment of the LAPD and other major forces around the country maybe two or three or four percent that stay in the blue uniform of the other officers what they'd been experiencing\nIs excessive force police brutality and then of course the police lie to cover it up okay that's what they've been experiencing frame ups frame up by the police for burglaries robberies rapes murders virtually virtually unheard of it's not that it's not common I Know this I've talked to another black\nI've talked to people who work in the black community that's almost unheard of and\n... did not see this issue\nTime magazine did not see the ancient times said well obviously it was easy for this jury to buy the frame of argument\nAll the jury had to replay on their mind is the tape of Rodney King get be getting beaten by the LAPD has if Rodney King getting getting beaten by the LAPD is the same thing as the LAPD other word is if the LAPD beating Rodney King is essentially the same as they're framing OJ Simpson who talk like completely different types of police misconduct\nAnd it's my belief without knowing\nThat this jury back in the jury one was thinking\nThis is the LAPD we know we can't trust them you know there's a reasonable doubt they may have framed OJ instead of thinking to themselves wait a while yeah maybe we can't trust the LAPD for certain things but frame ups\nThat's absurd I was on a San Diego radio last week and a fifty five year old black fifty five year old black woman called in and she was carrying and to me you know about the the the LAPD in the San Diego police department the industry blacks and I said no ma'am\nAnd she believed there was a frame of and all that I said man I'm gonna ask you a question now and I want you to think about it I don't want you to answer right away I think about it before you answer\nYour fifty five years of age I Want you to get to look back and do your past has that ever happened to you or any member of your family any relative any close friends\nHave they ever been framed in other words you're completely innocent the police come along if they ever been framed for a burglary a robbery or rape that are in our murder I'm not exaggerating Archie paused for five ten seconds and these were words no she hadn't thought about it you fall sure and and Darden\nShould have pointed this out to the jury it would have been in a looming eighty moment for all of them he didn't do it it went right over his head\nDuring look we're near the top they are but I Want to ask you very quickly wants to trial got underway was their juror targeting that\nI Can't tell you I mean I guy right I I don't know that is that how do we think you're you're\nTargeting I mean targeting by both sides were they both are or were they both playing games and ... they didn't think were a favorable so\nThere's that oh yeah of course that is not an every trial it's called a a a a primary challenge where you don't have to give any reason whatsoever if you don't like the way someone looks that you're the color of their time\nNo no I'm I'm Talking about wants to trial was underway\nTrials underway yeah there was a little bit of that uh but it wasn't too successful because Ito was not a discharging people jurors unless he came up with some evidence of possible impropriety you know one of them was\nRecalling the uh the ... the the anonymous letter\nYeah right but I mean he was under the impression that perhaps this woman uh was going to write a book and I wonder if he was or not I don't know but there was some evidence that went in that direction and uh yes the defense want it to get rid of her of course because she was perceived to be pro prosecute out to eat all you know didn't

Vinson thank you for staying I Know you've got an early interview a nonstop interviews I guess [laughter] um this again relates to the Simpson trial it's an important question was there anything\nIn ... track record or background that should have set off warning bells to guilt varsity before selecting them to do the prosecution\nWell I had never heard of either one of them before but that that really doesn't mean anything 'cause we have a thousand prosecutors that the da's office here in LA and there's one central office about Eighteen outline offices or I have since learned that\nThe Clark was perceived to be among the top prosecutors Dopp DA's office ... no one that I Know that said that Chris ... was perceived to be a top prosecutor why even around on the run on the case I don't know\nHe did a handle the AC calling calling the situation in front of the grand jury when the d._a. was contemplating the indictment against collie but yeah a little background there 'cause that was\nAn ancillary up part of this case whether colleagues with the indicted for being an accessory after the fact murder sure and then there was also the argument that whether he was a token black\nBut uh I can tell you a little bit about his background because I checked into it\nAt least the seven years prior to the trial uh he told the jury I'm Talking about ... I've been prosecuting bad cops for seven years well I happen to know that the da da da and the Rodney King situation was no exception I can just above guarantee you are that\nIf there hadn't been a tape there by that George holiday the eighty one second tape Mm private citizen no one would have ever heard the name uh Rodney King a fact Rodney king's brother when I went up to the foothills division of the LAPD the day after the the beating\nAnd this was before the LAPD knew about the tape and he um\nHe wanted to file a complaint against these officers from the desk SARS and said look your brothers and a lot of trouble there wasn't going to be any finally and again for officers in any event when guards and said I've been prosecuting bad costs for seven years I started thinking well wait a wise is this in the middle of the night with the goblins out I mean how can I haven't heard about this so I called down in the office and\nSpoke to two fellow deputy da's down there who worked alongside Darden in the special investigations division of the da's office which is responsible for prosecuting these misconduct cases here's what they told me\nThat in the seven years leading up to this trial Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen Ninety four Darden tried one case in one case only it was a misdemeanor case wasn't even on the case or any lost it it's a thirty ninth and don't and street case thirty ninth adult and there was a duplex there\nThat was believed to be a crack house and the police went in there and trash that looking for cracks and they were prosecuted for vandalism and dark and handle it\nAnd lost that case and if you look at his book you mentioned a lot of cases in S. I. D. uh but the only case that he mentions taken the trial if if you're a very close to me as a thirty nine and don't treat gay so he didn't really have a sufficient background\nBut assuming what are you saying because of color\nWhile I don't know I don't really don't know why they brought it not not before those seven years I don't know what his background is he says that he had prosecuted quite a few homicide cases and uh uh he may be telling the truth I don't know about that and he may have been successful but I can tell you that\nWhen he told the jury I've been prosecuting bad cops for seven years he was not telling the truth was investigating bad cops for seven years but not prosecuting that's\nFine as long as public image was lousy uh as I watched the trial I fully expect to garden at any moment to go jumping across the room and slug somebody\n[laughter] and and and that is what it looked like he he did have a chip on its own house [laughter]\nThat that that's pretty colorful away articulated there aren't\nLet me give you one one just unbelievable example of of of incompetence of between the two prosecutors surveys and it just it just illustrates a ... and again the book is three hundred and fifty six pages of this but this type of thing you're aware of the van that uh the van that are ah bringing the vile blood back to Iraq and if you're aware of that whole that whole issue\nOh yeah okay um let me just briefly tell you why why he did it normally you collect blood from a\nSuspect in a homicide cases a couple of days later a week later a month later sometimes even a couple of years later 'cause there's no statute of limitations for the crime of\nMurder and I'm a so it's it's it's not within hours after the murders as was the case here now the the the the defense argued that he should have booked that vial of blood immediately ... and he could have done that however\nNormally you do not get a D our number which you need to book items of evidence until the the uh the evidence at the crime scene has been collected by the criminalist pursuant to the search warrant here that hadn't been done yet\nA a fun was still at Rockingham first he has been a Bundy collecting evidence and evidence is booked sequence surely a by number so if the book that while\nIt would've been item number one but what the reason they didn't do that if he had no way of knowing what number of phone was given to the items of evidence that he was collecting that Bundy and Rockingham it would have messed up the whole numbering system\nWhat it would have made the argument that you'd carried it around and had opportunity a impossible yeah right\nAh but yes but it's also it was in advisable but I mean how could he ever dream that people like Shaq and Cochran or out they're accusing him of framing someone for murder I mean here's a guy twenty eight years on the force not one citizen complaint against him and twenty eight years he's about to retire and a few months with his wife Rita to his farm in Indiana\nAnd he's going to frame OJ Simpson it's mind boggling\nYou free you plant evidence in a capital case in California and testified falsely you can get the death penalty yourself under one twenty eight of the California penal code the prosecutors never even made that argument and in in any event\nFong had already given item number one to the spot of blood above the door handle and uh so so I'm a fan out or brings the bio blood back the fog and any detective will tell you that when they turn over items of evidence to the to the criminal is in their mind\nThat's the equivalent of booking not I just I'm giving you the background as to why he brought it back here why bought it back to Rockingham survived torture him on the day after the murders but here's the point that I Want to get into the defense\nArgument of police frame up and conspiracy and all that at the heart of that very argument was banned that are bringing the vial of blood back in what they claim does that then I met her in his evil co conspirators took blood out of that violin planted that ... had Rockingham and Bundy was a major major major issue with the trial\nPost trial post trial\nSeveral the juror said that it was the most suspicious thing that the LAPD did during the tire case okay now there were several arguments that the prosecution could have made to knock down this core defense argument about men that are bringing the wild but back to Rockingham I mentioned several in the book I'll just give you two very brief ones right here\nIf he was going to bring the vile blood back the rock and then obviously he put it in a suit pocket he wouldn't put it in a large ... thereby advertising to every one that he was bringing something onto the premise is that just common sense would point number two number two\nVan out are already knew that hundreds upon hundreds of reporters and other members of the media had already congregated at Rockingham and Bundy\nTheir cameras blanketing the premises picking up for the evening news all the movements of everyone on the state there are helicopters up above filming everything down below obviously planting would have been absolutely impossible there are many many other argument now what if I told you what if I told you listen to this because it's unbelievable there's no other additive\nThan in the eight hours of summation that these two prosecutors gave neither Clark nor Darden said one single word to try to knock down this court defense argument about ban that are bringing the vial of blood factor Rockingham they never once even touched on the issue\nI check the transcript three times I had my wife check is unbelievable I said there's got to be some attempt to knock this now because it goes to the heart of the defense case\nAren't when you get to the point when you don't even open up your mouth and under one single solitary word on an absolutely critical issue the question is how does it get any worse we're not talking incompetence here we're talking beyond incompetent if you didn't show up for work hard I wouldn't say that you were incompetent\nIncompetence of showing up for work and doing a bad job\nRight well we didn't even argue on it but they're not showing up for what\nAbout the angle that a a ride been out are carried it out in the ... but a lot of people's on well ferman socked away a little bit of it remember the sock business and took it over and planted it that's what a what\nI saw the glove ... the the glove they All right you know there were four teen uniformed officers that arrived at the Bundy murder scene before five minutes before affirmative ferment arrived rapid two o'clock and it's right at the these murders happen around a oath\nWhether there's ... there's there's a division and you know but but somewhere\nSomewhere between ten Fifteen and ten thirty five PM in the evening of doing the twelve correct the first officer arrives right after midnight okay they're Eighteen uniformed officers that arrived there before for him and all of them saw only one glove so there was no second glove there for ... to pick up\nAnd deposit at Rockingham even if you wanted to even if you wanted to frame Simpson by planning to go out there was no second glove there unless Eighteen officers would have been willing to take the stand and commit perjury for ferman now\nMind you Eighteen officers say they all they all made the statement at ... ... ... in front of a a a internal affairs but but but Clark only called two out of the team to the witness stand instead of calling you have a sixteen she had the other sixty and there she knew their names\nShe didn't bother calling all Eighteen the more you call that stand the greater the\nI'm likelihood that all Eighteen are going to commit perjury in a capital case just to help someone most of whom they didn't even know from why didn't you do the\nIncompetence grows on her computer I just I could give you an example here on the ... blood issues or nothing could have been more important than that she didn't even open up our mouth once\nKnown as well so then the bottom line is after all this uh OJ walks in just about everybody else's life on both sides is more or less ruined\nGood trip back in time continue with art bell

E. where'd you go what did you experience how did you know that this was effective for you\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room\nThey're going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall and when I ...\nYou reach the arm out\nOh no I was nonsensical I'd I didn't realize it was still you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nYou encounter any body ... guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here\nAnd a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself ... ... that's\nSad I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience from in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense ... than at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them\nYeah yes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I only seeing you know incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the information the dean dean why would universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that\nOnce you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human and it has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is and apps and he is so now when you\nYou have these extensions and you know they're real because usually they feel real you know he was playing because usually not a language to really clearly defined what an entertaining chin is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd it all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by soft ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore\nYourself and discover the answers for yourself there\nUm when

think it's important people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience a as science hasn't told us that\nSo many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people\nHave they wake up in the middle of the night and they're non mall over or their vibrating or they're hearing strange sounds you know these all can be\nA prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience with important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now sees when you are when people aren't going to be travels the game to he mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh ah at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research a matter of fact there was one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night at on this class\nAnd I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how the remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught\nAny more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind near twenty people hooked up to the mind\nOf their mind mirror it's just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that's you can tell what is what are you most responding to\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Unruh Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow they have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound a spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking\nAnd walking through a wall and a talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with higher self\nWith are multi dimensional self right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi

Institute Virginia\nAnd he's come up with a common reported to nominate on associated with the the ease Cleveland was wondering if you could explain this to our audience\nYes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years oh okay but I've been\nStudying this and practicing for forty or just to go on my website astro info dot org I included a over a period of ten years I did a a number of surveys\nAnd our receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it's it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were having or so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but\nThere's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset uh Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched\nThat was quite common thirty three percent ...\nHearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone and that is seen through ... through your closed I live at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process\nOf shifting your consciousness to your non physical body\nBecause you have and it doesn't manufactured in your body but it means you're in the process but most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things that\nAre for instance probably the most common it's just the jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body right is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body is your fell asleep\nSo that that's I see them on it because that happened if I'm a retired I Will switch and I think it's just mussels a nurse you're saying that's an out of body say\nNo I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have\nFound and what many other um experience or have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving at a face from our body such with sleep is\nMhm we take it for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint but what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out to phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people it's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the feeling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a slate\nAnd you can observe this actually during\nAn out of body experience and what does it look like\nThe image you're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream the cancer they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of\nBody experiences or as natural was breathing and think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't ... biological ... machine ... and then we're ... we're moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nIt's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess or play ... and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but\nVery few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nIf you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid get here would you go into an OB\nAnd ask that question and have you ever tried dead and I'm curious how the difference between now and imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay\nAnd you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies and are we still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning\nAnd I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a pass lives that wasn't on my radar but then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification\nAnd I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two and I also found out that my\nLet's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when a Austin will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOh what's going on\nAnd I think this is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated ... anyone other than you are\nRight and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt Marion point\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left backed up specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India\nAh [noise] were had been programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience a menu sudden oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report to you have you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age of just first out of body experience have you seen ... years old that people recruited recount changes and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but he declines during early teenage years why do you think that is so they sent you forget that\nI I

I mean has there ever been reporting of that and not a good experience and we're going to be is that you can't it's not right\nYou know like there has been an end to ease and nightmares in ...\nIf you're a fear based if you've been brought up with this concept that there's a devil or Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have you made like what you have a negative experience your own fear will create it\nWhen we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space\nAnd that's what people forget it and I I I said that's all the time you know we're not observers\nOf non physical reality we're participants\nEach thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energy is around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here but when you leave your body through near death experiences [noise]\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do she experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a closer look at yourself and your beliefs\nAnd to see how and try to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity\nIf if there is not like there's negative energy if you are going to create it when your mind is going to mold the reality around you if you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever\nThen you're going to manifest that is well\nWell you are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people don't like to hear this but the it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was it it's just a dream I guess I don't remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in the recycling took on their helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person don't know anyone that I'm\nBrian ... owns a motorcycle and it was and it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives and it wasn't a protection of anything and it was benign and was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just it was as if I had gone into a future mention\nWhich looks pretty bleak pianist and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because we care to each other [laughter] yeah I'd I don't know if that an adult locked out of body travel\nMost likely mhm well it could have banned\nBut it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo there's object there's consensus what I call consensus realities and there was non consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the\nConsensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality and they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist and\nIn our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start to learn these what is essentially the rules of non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time right it's the gravity we're used to air you know when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity all the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my workshops but it's also in my books but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence\nYes so that will be

being because\nGold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan I'm going to scare the ... out of there it's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial saying can you really shape e owners is is that there's any way to do than [laughter] funny\nYeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nOn so will you send me your book and we do are you constantly in Colorado during our guys shows and I thought it was so fascinating 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and its own assuming you can\nFind things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience where we are normal\nWell this is this I've been seeing go since I was neat a knee high to a grasshopper is what I always say I'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago it was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not\nMy goal was to try and a unite the paranormal can you ... community and to also\nDo some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend dory spins\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont\nColorado mhm and so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we've we call it a ...\nFeast because every year we tried to sponsor it in a different community and by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go on and the nights supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I woke up particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them\nTo see if it was possible that these things really happened and so that's what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGhosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through ship ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to buy were cancer and how do you how you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nWhat do you mean seeing it you you\nKnow I see it and I actually feel it\nOn the frame like humans to my examples that\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually since things I'm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't\nProtect that into the future but what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where was that I just close my eyes\nAnd I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was\nSo I'm able to do things like that um\nBut I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast in managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tours\nAnd I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nDid you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were oh starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansion sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast and I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was that in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying\nSo she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband\nAnd mind you and she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I I think it was like I filled out a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about\nFinancing the home for you and that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done in the arts and crafts file I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really run down\n... extremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down\nBut I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for and we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house and five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house ... what have you\nWell after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and um\nArtist you know and it's very iffy that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going roe [laughter] so I actually\nCalled the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest the state so I don't think anybody's ever seen\nAnything like wow I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you drinking so loud fluently\nEverything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait till\nThe ghost of Shirley actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named\nRight there in a sense that they're ready to find their way true north or south was gone and you know they had birds have a little piece of ... crystal in their brain and\nIt was the he was he must be leading that maybe because of the magnetic anomalies bred for hunting confused\nBecause they were actually behaving very strange\nManner by like diving into buildings and and like ... how the pilot [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado and we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am Lisa guardian listening to coast to coast am\n\n\n\nWhere mine\nAnd\nRadio seven ten WINZ [noise]\n\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute stocks into roller coaster weaken positive territory the Dow gained two hundred eighty seven points the NASDAQ up one hundred sixty Seventy has to be up thirty eight the NASDAQ one hundred index jumped nearly three percent just two days after its worst drought since twenty eleven\nNetflix rally six percent admitted opportunistic upgrade from analysts at city group\nNetflix reports earnings next week the U.S will be five hundred gained one point four percent and the final hour of treating alone\nTesla reaches a milestone one hundred thousand model three electric cars are left the factory according to the latest estimates from the Bloomberg tracker and that's impressive because just earlier this year Tesla's plans were extreme automation fell apart\nThat forced top engineers to rebel factory lines erect an enormous tent and revise the entire assembly process box office pro estimates Sony's venom will be number one for the second street weekend is finished with a hundred thirty eight million dollars in two weeks Martin ...

coast am I guess is Stephanie waters and she is not only a professional ... we can tell but he's also the owner of the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're ... in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nKnow I'm I think another reason why I'm that people\nWere drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nI went up there to the theater and that those is gone it worked\nShe'll be manager confirmed that\nThey know that all of this worked out beautifully [laughter] and eating\nNow had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing\nDuring the time before the book\nYes oh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said\nHer job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team because this theater had just been sold\nTo the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball in this book was reaching out desperately trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their stories\nThat yes you seem to be the you know like the ... for the east coast today [laughter]\nYou I have a caller made a huge\nIt's meant to be one you have no way really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you'll always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's haunted by the goals but like other little girl that bounces the ball\nIsn't she do I'm like no leave in ... ... and friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited\nAbsolutely not if they are they're just kicking you\nAnd your tricks improve\nTheir it's here they are in prison here by their own their own their own minds that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during my time so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil is finished and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely get picked believer in that\nDo you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but um or at three thirty in the morning but\nI find the best time to actually look for those if he wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time\nWhy it's ... it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and the oil painter hitting lends itself\nTo the shadows does that make sense\nYes it does it make strapped when you see the shadow people and the light changes very fast rate and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks in the end of the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is the police that you're living in now haunted or did you mention non hunters salute lead the gas goes follow you\nRight yes they do on line two words it's very funny the up and doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nJust kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and manage to her on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath bites they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know these certain locations\nAnd then one day my friend says why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of a trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would go on when you walked underneath them and I said [laughter]\nYeah that's true [laughter] so they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights will flash this this town is very haunted by\nA well it's true for a lot of areas I mean even bolder window I Walk around there and then went there once a month\nDoing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nTo you too I mean I heard that sometimes it just happened to some people with the ... lights\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd and the do you notice that that happened to other people who are just you know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much but then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause they think you're psychotic they're like oh you\nHave you tried to say it's happening it well so\nYeah they're like oh aren't you especially you know how to do in that case I don't really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that are there are there other\nWestern towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and managed to springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's really at\nThe rain there\nOh yeah you know the Stanley Hotel right there on that a NATO summit very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a there's a [noise]\nI heard pilots tell me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managing springs and bolder and even at the heart with ... with the infrared cameras at night time that you can see light up\nWind up with a red energy I find that very interesting and you know the NATO and he's the call this the sign of the ... the spine of the earth with the Rocky Mountain very sacred land it very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine

I ... out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience goes back to Nineteen Seventy three and I was not a believer and then there should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to explore it ... it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it and found that there was a message to self initiate\nOut of body experience so I explored them and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having the daily exercise um I initiated my first fully conscious out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it see if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your\nFamily you had to leave your car life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your out of body experience was self induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise that I that I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nThere was this before or after you became a Hitler therapists\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hit\nI mean therapist and I was a I used it to developed other techniques to help or negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your oh B. E. will get you go what did you experience how did you know it is sad to see him\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college\nAnd I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night\nAnd the next after a series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached beyond that oh no I was nonsensical\nI I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing by the foot of the bed\nAnd it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body ... guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this in my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may\nUm but they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here and a ...\nOver the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a sin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yeah yes\nAnd but you can experience at first and and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know is incredible as our our world is and you know this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all the intelligence that we have here and with all the pistons information's in ... why would universe just create one type of human being it that doesn't make any sense [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once\nYou have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human and it has\nTo be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you don't want him anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can do that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is still now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they feel real you know he was clean because it usually not a language to really clearly defined what an entertainment is\nUniversal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd the all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words\nLanguage is no longer a barrier we we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself\nThere was no um when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it each individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can\nDiscover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow you're listening you teach them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called it an afro tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body [noise]\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow

it but most out of body experience suggests to be clear or or spontaneous\nAnd people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations\nA sleep paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm and react uh I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis\nWell that's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWell it keeps these days that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think you know people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience as science hasn't told us that\nSo many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people\nHave they wake up in the middle of the night and they're non mall over or their vibrating or they're hearing strange sounds you know these all can be\nA prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people aren't going to be travels the game to he mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh ah at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research and matter of fact there was one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how the remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say\nI'm skills that are taught any\nMore interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings in these wouldn't mind near twenty people hooked up to the mind\nOf the online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that's you can tell what is what are you most responding to\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Unruh Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main\nMy main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound a spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking\nAnd walking through a wall and talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with Sarah higher self with are multi dimensional self\nRight and have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages that we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us\nAre multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of\nBeginning to open up to our own
