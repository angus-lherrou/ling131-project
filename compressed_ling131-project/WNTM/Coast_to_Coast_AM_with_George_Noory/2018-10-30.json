okay thank you thanks guys hey can I I\nI called because I have a phone can pick a kill 'em but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your race and\nSo you see 'em that irritated me why why at a you mentioned president having a waiter or I'm not up on that so all of us\nThat have looked us in the I I Can't do that as a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to see two things Tio first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the porn star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that warrior here's what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought she was actually going to that he was he put Ron and possibly win\nA presidential nomination for the Democrats [noise]\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all they had\nWas temporarily side tracked I'm a booming economy or tried to bring down that's nan but more importantly it man has kids actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one buddy young ... and ... and his wife\nAnd we had a president and did something so by all it can't even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was aiming for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so\nI don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you found him he's going to come back at you that's human nature and the second thing I disagree that is sad\nIs that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school or by it and it but I'm the I'm not that old guy there\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than a thing that Smith and it should be run like a business\nI have started to successful business as myself is that men and women don't have time for now it's time you get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy ... the dots and win wars\nYep home if he doesn't have money we need a businessman I voted for him because he said no nonsense that is that anyone that would bankrupt it four times and they had me on gas that he can get back up yet on the horse\nI got I I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in ish and she doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other people know that ... ... it it doesn't matter about this policy she knows she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that\nSo I disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think he did to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country in period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet a fair market value or even tried to get it for less than I think when people say let's let the country run as a business they're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I Would I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican Ken that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um ah the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThat well but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I commented on his tweeting too because I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like\nThat but if he let them spoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I think that was in their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I think what he has done his dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow what I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean it was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\nOr\nLook on that little news radio intend on ...\nOh

are telling me the people in the trucking industry say first time a truck takes out a school bus it's over it's just not going to happen you know we're we're we're dreaming\nAnd a lot of truck drivers helped unload whenever they're carrying you know I've seen I've seen trucks at night stopping off at the let's say like subway in there you know the truck is parked there and the truck driver guy is a loading everything in the store\nI mean how how is he has a driverless trucks going to do that\nIt it's not it it just not going to do it you know hey hey can I go back to China for just a minute yeah please okay one of the things that that a A R\nIs troubling demographers about China right now is there are a from a forty years old and under there about Ninety million uh um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or simply infanticide Ninety million where are they they're in the military\nAnd the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing with\nDo you see another major more breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it but I'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth is the Americans and that is a you know counting the United states Mexico central and South America or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need their oil\nWe've got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water it it just it I don't know\nAm one of those always missiles though\nGuinea [laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know it just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take place even even with wackos like like a Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening\nIn ... in fact I say I say what I see in\nIn Korea is going to be a unification of the north and the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that it's down like about one to\nHere's my concern though not from a country but from some terrorist groups that obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and trying to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nYeah that that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population\nYou can't possible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level fertility\nMichael in Jamestown North Carolina he Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher I guess my question is that uh is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most popular state ranking New York state and also the Knicks has become the largest city out raking I still don't hear\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather we're Kenny\n... that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out

[noise]\nYeah she's a Bloomberg market minute made something of a tech Saturday on Wall street not only are investors waiting for the quarterly results from Facebook and while analysts Bloomberg predicted thirty four percent jump in revenue in a hefty quarterly profit year to year investors will be looking for tarnish from a privacy breach\nNow that's the first college course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans\nBruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for a survey and my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nI'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me what I mean what did the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it's ... ... the paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age for my first paranormal experience it was an ... experience a near death experience\nAnd just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently and ah I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or Family Matters but to to students and actually I I teach a class now the college\nI'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about the paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nAh it it hasn't I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching\n'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was um\nA friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide [laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the field of the paranormal and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community of of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist historian\nUh but uh it from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean rate and who's\nThe chief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said there's Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is an eye confirmed this with with dean because he's doing and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in his research and there seems to be a and I suggested to him there seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWhile and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast years out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and uh I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just it just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he he works in this building at night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce olive sold ... latest book\nIt's called timeless the paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in she tells me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it\nIt well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in awhile put it on the back burner\nOr because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things ah it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this was the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined\nTo to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point at which they do this\nFirst one did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I was in a we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for live there about nine months so it was a winter time and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know it should be baking for a long time and just wanting to take a little nap and it's too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nButt relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep\nI thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was this really bright light up in the in the ceiling and uh between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen and ah it I felt like it it it was an end jelly presidents and it\nIt was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear and uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me\nThat was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's that's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing cycling right to see 'em\nThere's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kinda passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this was a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry boat\nOr there was no bridge you had to that island so there's very remote there is no hospital so\nUh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother\nOn line and you don't call\nIt a Bloomberg market minute investors will keep their earnings

little bit all of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark\nBut it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat and a ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck as we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she ... she said what what are you talking about big foot I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she\nShe [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep drive me and I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another mile from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later I found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking with ...\nThere's been yeah there's been more siting there than than any other place in in the United states as far as I understand from what the ... the uh reading that I did about it so now if it if it was a hoax or this guy's taken a

welcome back ... with us of course we're going to get to your calls as well as we talk about time was the paranormal world just so many different kinds of ... almost stories you've had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket or\nThe title alone kind of makes you shiver [laughter]\nWell I grew up in a in a um [noise]\nIn our region American community and we had this this older man who passed away\nAnd he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh we were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was\nHome to me and he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked\nAround and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant but ah I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid\nOf everything is going to be okay and he said it and then the typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he no he was just in the casket and and dead but so I I definitely heard his voice and um it it it was kind of\nComforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird when it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I I think I Know now but uh uh often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just this check everybody out\nSee what the suit was they're very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kinda paranormal ended up itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell do you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was the that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it is not good at at the college\nAnd I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book so I I've always wanted to do this and I I approach them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think\nIt might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and so I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get but\nAh as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list I probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues\nAnd and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California or younger people and and older people different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common\nThey ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple that are a little skeptical do ... including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the nurse seven weeks in the course into the course\nUm and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience of really what it what it turns out to be is you know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomena I relate my experiences they they read my book\nAnd we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here\nIn a nearby a steak house which will be fine ah that's ah a hunted and I'm\nSo that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your oh Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in a ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria in a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases it was it was shocking to say the least but ah\nIt ah it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression of and my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I ... a\nM visited by someone who's passed on and I might see an image of them in my mind but not\nLike out in the in the open kind of thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent what they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nPsycho can ... the ability to manipulate mind over matter happened to
