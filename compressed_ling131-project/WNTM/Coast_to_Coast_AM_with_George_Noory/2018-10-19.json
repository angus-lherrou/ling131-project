I Believe he started out doing magic tricks as many of these wonderful psychics do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there are six cents\nKicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately and then it kinda well close together you can't tell the difference but it's wonderful that you're you're falling down frames and did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guys got some powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and blocks

and\nThere there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe who will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking that's so restrictive limiting to higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and beyond\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah other um financial interests or very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because we're supposed to be in growing in a consciousness of the kind of

many\nWe'll cut it short would try to get right in there as quickly as\nYou believe in reincarnation\nI don't see how it's not possible how could we possibly have the experience as we have\nIf we weren't more and more than one time and either on the earth or another dimension so I think people can be here the first time because they've been in other dimensions other a\nPlanet I I don't think anyone is new so I'd have to say where I Believe in reincarnation as say a variation of it and the churches need to catch up a little bit which I think they are and they're really disorders\nAs a psychic or anything out there that bothers you the the the you feel very strange about\nWhat you said very strange about like um\nAre you picking on are you picking up weird feelings or anything like that\nBut I don't like going the cemetery I don't like the energy there and people who uh lose loved ones and they go to the cemetery frequently are pointing that person back to their\nGrave site and they they really want to go into the light they wanted to be elevated themselves and yet the grieving process is really not good it's not healthy for anyone I Know I Know that grief but you don't dwell on it you said you know I Love this person and good luck God Bless you and try to release them and\nAnd I always think about them right and\nThink about them because we're still well if I go into the light God Bless you I Love you thank you for what we had together and let them go I was going to the cemetery is very bad ah you know my my parents were big cemetery powers as when I was growing up is that a good we're going [laughter]\nI don't like cemeteries and I don't like funerals\nExactly but my parents were part of the generation that went to the cemetery it's a lot you know and I found myself in the cemetery is a great deal of growing up and at one point my parents were pointing to a Muslim as we were driving through Greenwood cemetery and my mom said she I think we should get one of\nThose oh and I'm thinking they were well at the time yeah I I'm thinking to myself I really don't want to live here they'll play no they're not going to stay here in the back of the

the off the seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked to find myself in the body of a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my life long on the standing\nThere will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about is you try to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something\nLike this person who could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get really sick we gotta live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same\nAnd sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my co dissociation abilities of travel beyond the body\nTraveling consciousness without psychedelic club drugs quite easily\nAnd an understanding that there will be on the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army's that we're moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you one thing that kept me going is amongst mine is a book companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was the big man and a lot of white airing upping face\nCome and sit on my they didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and one day or that you can't tell your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you\nThat invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and held him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe have time travel in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to youngest self and be cheerleaders counselor to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we've gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nBut it will lead in parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now on may be radically different so that's part of what dream traveling mainstream traveling Olson means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding the solo consciousness survived physical death is is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious not sold that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous on the standing as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my enclosed clued but loving family members around says to the spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about to get in contact information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the old ... and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and write them down will notice that they dream of and before they happen and one function of time travel we see the possible future we\nCouldn't read hosts the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but\nWe also traveled into the past from this life than pro mobilized you learned about a connection with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods in the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to dust and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experience this pop a dream and travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my own experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use this story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers them but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this was one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history a valued dreams and dream of they believe the dreams put you in touch with a God or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest ... so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our time is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows with our actions and attitudes from Baton and more objective perspective than we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what if that might begin to meet and if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams of law\nThe sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up to the scent of that by the gun to lose the sense of what it really means to be a human a fully a live human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding oath on to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about is how do we tell us\nSo one of the things lacking in our society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple full step process the sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done and minutes you get some help feed back in your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our opinions I mean bad habits of pots and that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get jobs do deal with the family we think that we should lie in the church in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness between sleep in the wake\nThat's a good time to catch it means is a good time to back and listen dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed to 'cause they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams so sometime this is very interesting\nListen to news radio seven ten WINZ

I was in the graveyard this week and I look at him\nAnd I was in a grave yet I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk and I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name on the head start is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it or what I call she's never beat him the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head said he says what do you think of that I said I have a great story the very great story I mean that introduced this whole thing about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat and to set a goal is to a certain place might even be an age of ... but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like contracts like I like stories so even on the day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a news story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and that these examples proliferate so\n... you know ... how it works is that the the attitude and the energy you're carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking waking fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason everything in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know you need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind to match up into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us about how to matter of reality is a dense of consciousness so\n... there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages discoveries there's the phenomenon but used to be called pre sentiment which I experienced a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize\nWhat is going on the body reacts to something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled it's surprisingly high\nThere's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to do uh get get some blood for a blood analysis hit the gusher in my blood is boating in Ohio you living in tents\nAnd after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland beat the white queen ... the white queen scream\nBefore she ... she doesn't have to scream when she actually ... thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the Ford took place\nOn the doctor said my goodness that probably is a scientific proof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment onto the patriots symptoms but I couldn't possibly be reported people the guy was looted you\nWell you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body also the thing we knew everything\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it you know so medic responses we pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel with the feeling in our body as well so that's about the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell active dreaming is the way of getting active with dreams in the sense that you again to remember your dreams you got to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some elite energy and guide in July from your dream I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's all the method of loose the dreaming you would call it ... medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way up and back you're going to loosen treatment venture\nIs to start out lose to the state lose what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming in the workshop\nOr we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance the bench is still in the stream\nLet's go on with the dream that get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror stuff the stuff going on by going back inside the dream and I think the scary based on the ground it might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try like state\nTreating sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like a tend to the images that rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the themes that will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming of the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look for the outlook for signs of both in the world around you so this is also a program on a method of attending to the dream like symbol of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think the dream themselves misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams in themselves as a deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't walk around but you can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to is that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible based but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront these two on the ground you might find that behind something that's scary you know worrying you and\nYour tree is the power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or a life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not the step to put a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about to be very misleading\nYou got a rubber we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and take phone calls and continue chatting
