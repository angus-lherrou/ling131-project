I'm a strong advocate of getting rid of the department of education what are your state's take care of education the way we're supposed to be Jimmy Carter but the department of education employees and to me it's a waste of fifty some odd billion dollars a year as far as giving credit for somebody going in protesting\nI Would I Would love to see where that actually happened and I would love to follow up on that you know what school it was\nI forgot the name that many years ago and I forget to watch anyway\nNo way listening seventies still young you got plenty of time so do you favor us send me an email at ... dot com and if you remember where that school was I'd love to follow up on it\nIf it's a state sponsored taxpayer subsidized school there's no way they should be doing something like that private school they've got different rules would that would be ridiculous to do to give somebody a benefit for protesting on one side of an issue over the other let me go to line three Patricia ...

temperament to be on the court that's being able to do with no\nHe doesn't have the temperament to be on the court\nOh by the way members on the left on that committee interrupted Chuck Grassley the Republicans nonstop\nI guess they have the temperament to be on the Senate Judiciary committee and to be senators but he doesn't know the temperament to be on the court when he was honestly

or in the school because that's all they talk about\nThe the left will say it's obstruction of justice if they should win the house and they will in fact the way you got him in\nThere with all the bill claims bill claimed that he tried to do call me to not investigate the swimming anymore bill so that he tried to drugs drug justice to stop comics do you look you and I agree he didn't do that\nBut those are the grounds they'll say obstruction of justice I think they will in fact impeach him and I think the Senate would would uh would find him not guilty so nothing would happen\nBut

... okay I'd like to answer that if I could I'm\nIn my opinion what remote what differentiates remote viewing for normal psyche functioning is the remote viewing is usually done within a control protocol and the protocol is essentially been the same and has been an change then so\nBe original research and the remote during a Nineteen Seventy two Sri\nI'm One of the things that dictates remote ... the dictates the protocol is the remote viewing is uh usually done blind with the subject and uh the there are specific requirements that go along with the protocol that are generally not violated\nA generally not violated all three of you have gone from the military Stargate Program into individual endeavors in civilian life ... any of the three of you in any way significant or not

different approaches to remote and doing a job uses a one approach a linen I use another we learned ours are essentially from Ingles swan uh it's called controlled remote viewing I used to be called

Monica will ah who even one time scored\nOne hundred percent on a\nOn fifty two cards while I was very very impressed I should someday reached that did did you say one hundred percent uh there was one instance in the database where he got one hundred percent correct so it can be done\nOne one of the this is Joe I'd I'd like to say something about the accuracy um [noise] I I've been working for over Thirteen Years with cognitive science lab in California that that's the original founders of the original research and remote doing and\nUh we we've collected statistics on on dozens of remote yours or what I Would call world classroom outdoors\nAre generally speaking a on an average a very good remote viewer can be expected to make contact with the uh target site about sixty sixty five percent of the time\nAnd out of the information they provide\nA the the hackers who the information will run anywhere from thirty five to eighty eight percent now there there are times when the grid remote viewer will get a hundred percent or near a hundred percent quality remote viewing but those are extremely rare\nAnd when someone establishes they're they're sort of history over a long period of time say turn to a Nineteen years\nAh that that's the kind of percentage as you can expect\nOne of those percentages increased with a team\nNo I'm from a research standpoint uh everything that we have in the database that we've looked at it are the kind of the science lab\nOr the Google factor goes up when someone starts talking about trying to serve and nobody has a political career wants to be caught the standing next to any of those like it's\nAll in fact we had tremendous support from the Senate on down in a in some very important positions and government and when those people were asked to respond in particular to the Nightline program\nOr without exception all of them responded positively but refused to go on the air or state that probably [noise]\nAll right I'm not surprised um you all three of you have now turned to sue the civilian application for a remote viewing um\nAre there are there other ethical and moral limits or if I Walk into one of your organization's with a whole ... bundle of money and I say look I Want to know what to me to be she is going to produce into following area what they're doing move you do that for me\nUh this is Lynn I um have very definite moral and ethical limitations there are certain things I Will not teach a and basically during the span of the course just a learning the basics\nThere is so much to learn that oh you don't really have time to learn all of those esoteric things anyway are\nNow asking me when we wait oh there are certain things you won't teach\nOh I Do not oh even address the subject of remote influencing and won't um\nOh all three of you I take it agree remote influencing which means uh by the way folks the ability at a distance or to influence what somebody else actually does not just read their mind but influenced their mind that it is possible\nOr remember it's not remote control it's remote influence understand\nRight oh the um voted one oh I Want to ah make one thing very clear by the way of keeping the database I kept all the information on all the projects\nAnd at no time was there ever\nAn official\nTasking to\nOur unit are done by our unit\nAre involved in remote influencing anything that was done was done by individuals on their own time and there was some experimentation and so forth but at no time where we ever task\nTo do that well would it be your view when a unofficially that remote influencing is possible\nI Believe so I uh have collected the data and tried the experiments and have come to the conclusion that it's extremely possible\nMy God then you know I I again this brings me back to the military's the parent dismissal of this remote influencing would be of such intense interest to them or is it just seems impossible to me that they would not fully explore\nIt well if you're a politician funding\nSomething would you want to get caught funding remote influencing\nOn me or I don't\nThink any politician does and of course any time you do something and government there's always the chance of a leak and somebody finding out\nBut then again they let it go death sure but they don't want to get caught selling missiles to Iran either well that's right and our government does lots of things that it it might not otherwise want to get caught at and the idea of being able to remotely in ... influence of Boris Yeltsin or or Saddam Hussein or any of the other big guys\nThis is Joe I'd like to comment on that from a science standpoint sure um I ... as I said before I've been over Thirteen Years with their cognitive science as well but uh there there are a number of labs across America I'm there had been involved in remote doing research and\nMany of those labs have tried some some experimentation into remote influencing arena\nThere has been some some very interesting and provocative results which are still very much up in the air\nUh so if you were to say absolutely we can prove remote influencing you would have to say no we can't but if you said that there probably that there is a high probability that it's possible\nYou would have to say yes but all the research isn't in yet that based on that uh I don't know how you would actually apply it and uh be expecting a very uh open ability to validate the outcome that's right\nUm and the experimentation I've done a the experimentation I Know is completely full of holes and could be shut down by a you know junior ... scientist\nWho uh but uh I have a done the experiment to my satisfaction are now believe\nThat it can be done and quite easily oh but as far as proof I'm Still waiting for prove myself\n[noise] um our president has done from time to time over the last several years things that seem utterly uncharacteristic have any of you had anything to do with it\n[laughter] but I voted in with my vote\nNo [laughter] All right um I without naming anybody a would one of you say Oh yes I definitely and my own mind I Believe that I definitely remotely influenced somebody's action\n[noise] yes [noise] ah this is what I was saying I Am convinced by so that it does work\nUh-huh um\nHowever let me again repeat that it was never official never official ...\nOne of the this is Joe or one of the problems here are is um when you start talking about remote influencing of other individuals and then you bring in uh integrity and uh\nYeah and that sort of thing as a ... ethics ... one of the problems\nThat you become very heavily embroiled and especially within America and especially within research um is the fact that there are human use considerations have to be taken into consideration and\nAs soon as soon as you are sort of formally identify someone to participate in such an experiment you have to tell them ... what's going on All right\nGentlemen hold tight oh we'll be right

that ah I've\nBeen watching this on the net wait a minute who is this oh I'm Sorry this is Lyn Lyn okay I've been watching this on the net\nAnd ah [noise] if you look very closely or the the\nConcept

Dave Dave\nSquared off it it uh it and I are at and Joe ... and\nI think soon to be at and Paul oh and and uh several other people and if you may notice a pattern grew in there oh\nWhy do you guys let me restructure the question what are you guys not love it [laughter] [noise] ah there are several reasons\nOne I'm a [noise] for one thing oh when he got out of service have started a he started giving classified information to the public\nOh I'm a while it was still classified uh\nHe uh is making claims that he oh ran the project that he started the project that it was you know that he brief the president and and I mean these are laughable thing as a\nIt not happen you say not true or not true All right uh\nI'd like to make a comment here as well uh this is Joe a is also made claims that I've worked for him and uh that sort of thing and those are in fact we not true statements\nYeah he said I worked for him to and I didn't [laughter]\nAll right here's a fax a Mr mcgonigle ... has has said that ... or ... was never a remote viewer ah with the government but was simply a person who was employed interview prospective candidates for the government remote viewing program could you please ask him to comment on that\nUm this look look let me jump in the halls around this is Paul okay well\nThat's actually not completely correct to end his nose pulled the Joe's because they didn't overlap had came in on the scene a long after Joe was gone\nUm and actually did indeed do did participate in some operational what we're doing projects however that wasn't his primary function or he was indeed a a\nA more an analyst task or a managing training and stuff you know he did he he he was kind of a Jack of all trades in that regard he wasn't hired primarily as a rule you were in only under exceptional circumstances that you do that but he didn't do indeed\nDid do some operational during I got that he did one didn't have a ... to ... says on for on for a number or I haven't gone through the list but uh I'd say uh I saw at least six or seven that he was a list as if\nIran I really I didn't have that and I didn't remember that from a database of ... this is Joe I'd like to comment on my comment [laughter] ah that's not an exact quote for what I said All right\nUm the claim was made a um by a\nA dams that that he was the only person who who was qualified the trainer or teacher of the people remote do and that he was the the most accurate remote viewer in up in the project and the only one who was responsible for your and my comment was that\nHis primary job while he was with the unit was to\nTo act as a monitor and interface with the the viewer in terms of uh handling are setting up remote feelings and that he was not a primary trainer he may have trained or in the sense that he ran practice sessions and that sort of thing\nAnd and that's OK that everybody had specific jobs on the Internet\nUm and every one performed as they were required and I suspect that he perform you know righteously ended the jobs are very well [laughter] or or I have a problem is\nWhere he makes claims then then attributes them to himself when they're in fact don't have anything to do with him they had something to do with someone who perhaps is not even with this any more to that\nIn a private moments are you gentlemen have have you not referred to it deems as Dr Doom\nOr this was a nickname that was given to him and the unit before he came to us or he was a he was called Dr Doom over there ah he's been predicting\nDoom death and destruction for years and years and years now\nUh-huh or would you say that he has seen things that the rest of you have not seen\nBut that would be a perception this into a\n... and that's fine um well one of the remarkable things about remote doing is that when you when you make a production or you make a statement about something a one would hope that there would be some validity or some method by which you could prove whether you're the veracity of the information or I could\nCertainly choose or pick targets that are completely under viable and make all the claims I Want and that's okay um\nThey'll never be shown are proven one way or the other but one would hope that if you're going to be making claims about remote viewing and its in its capabilities that you would be a opening yourself to being tested in some way or producing information that can be verified\nNo right well that ah opens up another topic and maybe a little bit in the sense that games\nUm he's been on this program and said I'm sure you're all familiar with the amazing Randy so call [laughter] um and it has been on this program and said uh as straight out he accepts a Randy's challenge there is something like a million dollars are now more\nSitting there waiting for somebody to prove psychic ability\nAnd deems has said I accept I called the amazing Randy so called and asked him to come on he settled socks and said okay there's numbers in my safe tell it to come up with these numbers I said that's not fair\nUm you're in control of the uh uh the numbers and I I don't like that so how about coming on the program and setting up a structured test\nUh with the controls set up here on the program and the amazing Randy so called did not come on the program would not come on the program I'm do any of you feel that the amazing Randy's challenge could be a taken and met\nA as it stands a he's he's basically a a magician has a slight of hand and sleight of mind\nUh and if you if anyone does things on his terms oh he wins I don't care if you were a hundred percent accurate or\nDoing it on his terms you'd you'd uh\nYou'd be subject to a magician sleight of hand and uh I mean it's a it's a gimmick a\nYou know that he uses for\nFor his own a popularity and so forth\nOkay but if it yes but if if the controls were set up a independently uh from Mr Randy\nThen he wouldn't participate\nAnd so that's why he wouldn't come on the program\nSure right that this is Joe I'd I'd like to just say something\nAbout that he he doesn't accept the current scientific controls that had been verified proven and used to cross a nine to eleven labs and the world\nAnd so he's not hardly going to come on your show or in in establishing a valid or reasonable protocol and allow someone to attempt to do the revolt doing so I have

experiences that are that people are having\nIn a while we may not be able to say specifically very much specifically about it other than they are experiences doesn't mean that it should not be

some very interesting uh concepts about it but we we don't get any closer to the truth\nUm are there are there are aspects of uh Stargate that history of you are still unable to discuss publicly\nYes of course they are I Would have to say about Ninety five percent of it\nOn my God really yeah absolutely so when they said Stargate is declassified they only generally meant the fact that it existed\nA generally so yes uh-huh well here's Paul um the the biggest body of of material is still classified and and probably ought to remain classified deals with the actual projects themselves and the reason for that is not the connection with ... remote viewing but the connection with other intelligence sources and means\nUm if there is material on some of that some of those projects that would that that could potentially harm our intelligence collection capability it might have disclosed the existence of some human source that we have you know and and\nUh even outside him at risk or you know uh there's a lot of stuff in there that isn't even involved with what we're doing that that is sensitive to end a important to ah American security\nWould agree with that you made a rather

E. dot net\nOkay that's a RV I as a tidal wave one word dot net right All right and uh you answer your email I take it\nYes [laughter] you know it I can guarantee I keep up or if I have if I get inundated but I Do my best\nUh well uh you're going to be inundated believe me what projects or it in the remaining moments here what projects or have you all taken on after the military I take it you're leaving the national security stuff behind now are you probably had enough of that sink a ship\nA gift or maybe you do you I don't know\nUm uh but uh but so what are you doing now\nThis is Joe I'm I'm a research associate still with the cognitive science as well that was the original evidence\nRight and then later as I say I see and uh we're currently working on some very interesting contracts for a uh some major corporations that have passed us with doing some research or up here and we hope to continue a pursuing the mechanisms behind remote doing\nDuring you talk about it at all I mean I Am for example our own CIA which wants to spend all its time I'm with national security work uh uh you know Congress and oversight committees have been talking about changing the direction of the CIA to a industrial espionage\nUh we we of course it see a sellout are the kind of the sciences lab has never endorsed uh espionage with any kind of were primarily interested in trying to uncover the mechanisms that supports I function\nOr we've recently done three three or four a very interesting pilot studies that have\nIndicated that we may be on to something with regard to two or three of those mechanisms and if those prove out which we have every reason to believe they will uh there'll be some very astounding a findings that will uh open the door to a whole lot more research\nDo you guys ever scarier selves\n[laughter] every time I chose scares me enough talking uh\nI I Am [noise] uh no longer surprised at at this science but I'm never quit being amazed\nBy it I Would agree with that statement\nIs it one of those things that once you have big gun uh I I mean I have yet to talk to a remote viewer who was involved in the government program or otherwise who has said this is lousy I'm I'm On board or I'm only interested I'm not doing it anymore is it one of those things that once you've done you will always do\nA this is Joe uh it's I I always tell people that if you are if you wanted me to sell my experience in this for ten million dollars I probably wouldn't\nDo it however\nIf you offered me ten million at the beginning to do it and then I knew what I knew now I probably wouldn't participate\n... I guess and yeah that's a good answer that's really a good answer All right well we're about out of time anybody uh want to issue any final words here um I of course would love to have you back at some future point um but any any final words for the American audience is intensely interested in this whole thing you've been doing\nMost like Paul I'm suddenly somebody else wants to say something too but um I I think there's a very exciting a process I think it's very exciting time to be involved in this and the\nAnd I'm Glad that people are interested that kind of been the case what we were doing in secret for so many years so I encourage people to develop an interest in it and to explore it and find out about it\nSo in other words uh go ahead folks if you're interested solid\nThat's that's right Joe this joke and I I just want to add one thing for you know after um I Would encourage people to retain or skepticism and to ask questions it's it's okay to challenge whoever's doing this in and have them explain or open\nA to review and criticism what exactly it is that they're doing uh that's that's where knowledge is developed and\nIt's how we decide whether something is truly valid or not so I\nWould encourage continued interest but to be skeptical and ask questions well\nYou know somebody might likely saying we've only got a few seconds All right I Want an instant demonstration you know arts holding up something tell us what it is that is not the kind of thing that remote viewing lends itself toward is it\nThat's that's correct this is Joe I'm I I've actually done six live remote feelings on camera for national ah a national television and anyone in America\nAnd uh one of the requirements has been that they just abolition follow very closely the protocols and in those performances have has been open to review and criticism\nAlright Joe ...

download UNT em [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAll right well here's a question from Ross in California and it's a neat one uh please ask Lynn if he has ever targeted the period of time in which the dinosaurs roamed earth\nAh not personally oh that is a I'm\nA fairly good training target and uh uh in fact I think maybe I have a in my in my early training um you know just as a as another uh\nA session to see if you're on target because we have feedback on that\nWell there was a there is the second part to the question okay or if so was man walking side by side with the dinosaurs\nOr I don't remember specifically getting that I have always felt that a a form of man was yes uh-huh but uh that I didn't get that from remote viewing I got that from other studies that have done okay a simple archaeological findings\nAnd then you know good PS here a PS why can't remote viewers win lotteries and um before you answer that I Would have answered a Ross in California by saying Ross how do you know that a lot of the winners of lotteries aren't re most humorous\n[laughter] so but you answer the way you want when\nAll right we have ah people working on numbers which is a very hard thing to do in remote viewing a there is another type of remote viewing called alternate I mean I'm I'm well a A R B a alternate remote viewing\nUh which uh substitutes remote viewing targets for the numbers and a allows you to a remote view for instance the pick three now the way that it's normally done is if you are doing to pick three\nYou have a four people working a three viewers\nEach of which will remote view one of the numbers and one person who collect the data looks on the chart to see what the results Maine and goes and places Tibet\nOff um\nBut it it it's been done and uh oh it's been done successfully\nWell if remote influencing as possible how about sending ed McMahon and the gang up my driveway\n[laughter] they're coming here first uh I see oh yeah I I understand that I really I Do a first time caller line you're on the air but Lind Buchanan hello\nWell do you help people like this the ...\nAh yes now one of the problems that I have is this a security clearance and ah [noise] for many other reasons as well\nOr if there's an investigation going on especially on an American citizen\nI Will only work it through authorized channels and so if someone comes to me and says you know uh uh my son is missing or or ah I don't know what happened to show and so yes I'm I Will tell them\nPartially because I I Want the cushion they're partially also because it's a necessity that oh if they will get the investigating officer to contact me I Will be glad to work the problem for free\nOr die ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am listen to me listen to me he just said have the investigating officer in your case the gave your son contact him\nThere aren't there you know and I think that many years to cater to climb\nYes but there was an original investigating officer on the case\nWe uh ... retired by now\nWe worked a case not too long ago a last year some time that had been closed for nine years and uh and on the results of our uh\nOur session a male Dave and I worked on this the results of our session the case was reopened and they've been finding a I hear some uh some new evidence\nSo do that man well how can I get a hold of lane okay that's a good question Lynne or ... what is the best way to get a hold of you\nOr do you have Internet access\nOr I Would presume if she doesn't she can get it\nOkay oh I Would say the easiest the easiest to address to remember is art bell dot com and a ... there's a link to my page and on the pages my address and phone number\nAll right there you are on them and uh I might add that if you don't have a friend with a computer who can do it you can go to a public library and I just remember my address a which is WWW dot art bell dot com [noise]\nNow let me also say that right at the present time\nWe are heavily backed up with a sign witness program ah cases and so we're we're really bogged down until we can get more votes years working on these so um oh I Hope people won't be offended if um\nYou know if they call and uh have their police department call as well\nAnd uh nothing is done that day ah we have a we have tremendous backlog here\nCompletely understandable uh west of the Rockies you're on the air with Lynn Buchanan good morning\nAri yes\nGood morning on my credit for that kind of lost track of all\nPeople out there to cover up a fake story that\nAll right I'm old that that is an awfully good question in other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate\nIt back a absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote viewing is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with oh and there is a thing that a recall basically the neighbor's cat\nOh if or someone else whom you respect very much a does a session\nAnd on a target and they're wrong that out of you respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing as well this is one reason why I never\nUm oh\nI asked the same exact question to two different viewers you know each other\nWell this brings me back to it deems a tapes which generally the group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works\nIf it works then I'm all for it\nBut then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing maybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes will be paid and couldn't there'll be assertive virtual anarchy that would develop that's\nMy fear I Do believe very strongly in the show direct effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote view correctly the easier it is to learn to remote you correctly that more who learn to remote view incorrectly the easier it will be to learn and correct\nMe incorrectly ... and this is my big fear with so many of the\nQuickie courses that are out there oh I'm afraid that they're going to through the shoulder I could just uh you know the hundredth monkey a Fisher a just a almost destroy any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYeah well what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released it a very or relatively comparatively inexpensive price\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can uh get people doing this oh and doing it well then\nI'm all for it and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nWell listen we're coming to the end of our actually the entire program uh\nYou've really been a trooper sticking it out through the whole program it's got to be a one of the sudden has to be back there huh\nYes uh looking out the window it is a huh\nAll right my friend while I suspect you're going to have a lot of emails to answer

Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff I don't like it sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me thinking you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of\nAnd he went to the the um [noise] the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\nAnd ... and when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that exactly\nI was just such an offensive like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies\nAnd it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I Want to offer but\nI wanted to ask you that are still doing that I remember you know it was always go x-ray your candy I mean\nReally do you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist often\nX. rated the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out [laughter] I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look to the candy makers that okay but he did it yes so they can feel the stuff that he\nQuit the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people were coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this yeah law something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it for money isn't always raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nUh and then it came over with the with the first and second we use of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the uh the with Charles ... have you know when they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror right\nYou'd actually yeah family is coming together to make a kid's costume ... and\nWhat you find is that the first in the in the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and you know plastic molded and stuff but what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise\nAnd you know it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who were you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the\nDrag yeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you know Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know there's something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure um sell you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since she studied it so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well ... us no good question you know I think that um you know ... ... ... Halloween as mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've\nWe've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you were with each generation will teach you know a couple of generations it changes a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people have taken it too far a in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like ours and stuff it's like\nScary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's not Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who doesn't like to dress up well like to dress up right I mean eight year old kids love just eighty year old kid like to dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just\nInherently a humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and ask them for candy uh you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or you could you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be sort of you know virtual a go if you know where you've\nGot like holographic you gotta you gotta ... who is this giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door and that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about their seats\nPanic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening to coast to coast am I'm tiny Willis and this is willing to wean tonight\nNever missed a detail on a show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free coast to coast am dot com\n\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to the cw I already all you\nDon't miss the iconic performances ya\nWatch our must be I heart radio music festival tonight and tomorrow night starting at seven on the Gulf Coast cw\nThis was a Bloomberg market minute playboy is trying to make it come back the playboy club has reopened it stores in New York as a company pins its future on experience it's\nFundamentally what's happening is shipped from an ad focused model to a consumer focused model\nChristie Hefner former chairman and CEO of ... says many media companies are trying to reinvent themselves again\nIt was all about how to create the biggest advertising before and we under charged for the product and that became a problem even before the destruction of the Internet and\nNow it's something that those organizations are trying to get themselves out of\nYou might say the New York club is played by his version of a life of the strategy we ... has that tech conference the New Yorker has that annual festival in New York Times sells travel tourists with journalists as guides playboy bailed on a U.S licensing business five years ago\n\nGotta feeling toys for the war in the house\nDavid your guy that has overcome a severe issue\nWhether light the light bulb went on and I started to research on the other reasons why I was going through capsules I couldn't get enough it made me feel so much better I can tell you one thing the product war\nAnd not only works in one way it works for a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy that gives me ... or how to better way carnivores built everything back into my body in a while but you know what it's better and I can't say I don't know\nThis is Richard Ross Perot or for carnival or research international call one eight six six eight three six eight seven three fire that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\nOr visit carnivores dot com C.

talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great things great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating\nUm goes goes hunting stuff so let's I Want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of goes tiny so Ben\nI'm as we talked about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but\nI Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the the orange and black and the witches and the you know and the Frankenstein and the Dracula kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like 'em but then there's this deep darkness and said panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nYeah I mean one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in you know mum haunted house reached out and grabbed a crook somebody aware and there are some of that but\nBut you know that for every one of those examples you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who were just you know have the time with it [noise]\nUm you don't mean that I mentioned before you know so and what not they're they're upping the panic about a lot of conservative causes the candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient the health I mean they they they they worship anything\nResembling the crushing devil at all I mean they ... if if you drink when if you ask them you know if you told them about from from goat creature that you know the evil they what they do what you're talking about one or the world view\nAnd in again knows someone festival died out one before um before you know that the the Christian concept of of the military and came up and so when you find is that you know the tradition of course when you look at it\nTwenty two Eighteen you know ... not suffer which to live um and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this is fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more\nUh obviously comes up every every year so it's coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at uh the hearts of St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking into ghosts and and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it it said uh when did you boards are strictly prohibited anyone using ... will be kicked off the property and it was just it was just so interesting I mean the\nThe owners were so so concerned that using the word you board was going to open up you know do you want it ... or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nWill know about but it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and it was I'd never seen that like you know in the rules are going to sign this don't use it and so you know typically the concern\nIs uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween it wasn't\nIt wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties that twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was ... that\nA kid the dresses up as a which are of goal will become interested in witchcraft or Wicca or vehicle because of that and so that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that um they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party so the the the the they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff\nAnd of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that they'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything but I just um I just remember as a kid levine at that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy and like I said again you know black lights\nAnd uh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local\nRadio station ... W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers we take you to you know as a kid and\nYou got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was all wacky haunted house there was nothing nothing scary or\nIt was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy when they came to Christmas and just the way I live right down the\nMarathon borrow either right away I assume doing those\n[laughter] you'd freeze those have you ever had them frozen\nOh they were great and you you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came in that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the ruler on the back oh man I'm going to go after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face last usa McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the\nFight there you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup member on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there now so well knowing all the origins\nOf Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they deliver to cemeteries and they go into the woods or they go into\nWhat's what's um paranormal rap normally need to know what's normal\nAnd you know whatever readings you get\nYour walking around with the M.

and I want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want to you know we can talk about this forever but just for time's sake I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it\nWell you know um I I I don't know it goes or I mean that that's you know at this million dollar question right I mean you even even among the ghost hunter unbelievers\nAcross the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are you don't have a theory that there is something that's going on in\nThe murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and tree the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beans other people say that they're you know the spirit that that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions you know problematic for grocery search right because\nGoats can't be both in our dimensional spirits and you know a an emotional recording into a tree or a house of murder and you know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena has such a widely disparate range of explanations that the problems so I I don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that that\nMy my best guess if they're real would be basically a folk Couric explanation that would be there some sort of fears of the debt that we\nWere we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nMm good stuff for windows for Willis weaned so thank you for hitting the ... information\nYou have in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can go to

how are you\nI'm good Ken Coney Island thank you very much for allowing me to come on here and shared a bit of information um you know when I first started researching the truth proof books the story

because I'm I'm not here tonight to subscribe to the idea of like cancer but I Do believe some thing exists something very real otherwise it will not to be unreported income for over\n... over a period of hundreds of is you know sort of through the through the ages in fact I mean [noise]\nIt it's an ancient piece of software the where the story originates from county which is the ... which is probably\nThe most important archaeological site in Britain and one of the most important science in the world uh you know some of your listeners might not have even heard of it but it's worth it's worth researching I'm stuck out is that is mentally fit middle stone age and just give me give you a brief outline of the ad oh\nYeah absolutely it's it's a it's a it's a archaeological sites dating back to nine thousand bass said as I say it's a middle stone age just after the ice age people settled there\nAnd these people were just home together that they actually settled on flexed unstuck or a it is now the lake he's gone now we've got ... to be honest with her the cows run across stuck or you can in some places you can feel the ground reverberate because he's so\n... ... ... to\nThe people I mean this is the evidence of the first house home ever built by the Israeli settlers in the U.

[noise]\nTelling the truth I mean\nIf you like a refuge was built on it and the ... century took place called spill Kona inflicts than it was built by a king all this can be research listeners you know it's not just things that both NATO\nAnd the king was ... he ... he gave a night the job of building the refuge the night it's a fabulous name what's called a home\nSo he built this refuge to protect trouble trouble is from an infestation of Savage base [laughter]\nThat's the interesting thing\nYeah it's probably some spots where the name spittle hospital comes from\n... that's why they call it spits O'Connor\nOr at least they be devoured I I was lucky enough to contact the people in our own ... what is now the ... in\n... after they've been stopped faced being a refugee hundreds of years ago because they supposed to nine fifty seven this refuge was built so we're going back a long way obviously far back as the early settlers of stock or\nA bill ... but it was built to\nProtect travelers from an infestation of Savage beast\nThey be devoured it said no I took that dates and the ... some of the ... that's what it says on that\nHuman ... on the line that you'll find that says this we we must also no forget Tony that you know during this time we will divide wolves prevalent in the u._k. and bad so\nYou know that we're not necessarily to an entirely talking about two ... foot this these stories that are quite incredible because when you look at the line and you can you go into the research you discovered the flakes than was once called ...\nWhich is interesting and I it's now ... old ... on old maps those areas of flexed and they pick to this will fund\nAnd just a few ...\nSomebody changed the name ... to make it like like maybe be seen safer something or they didn't want people to think of the old miss maybe or you know why would someone changed the name I mean that's like ooh there's a reason why that\nYeah well there's a reason and we'd go connotations to the world for you know in any case it is true with proper research this that can be sort of back to pre if anyone else wanted to look into it\nYou know there's a there's a small village just a few miles away called home to ... and if you break down the name ... and then go back in history and look we'll do some sort of research\nAnd housing hound mom they ... they used to be called farms that

rosy so they ... as you look over towards the ... the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching\nIn the daytime and there's a large hedge homes and things about he said he probably eight to ten foot tall and they want you to turn round to speak to his friend and call this thing and his peripheral vision and then looked and saw it on the left over the head ... he said\nHe thought he was a young hopes he meant\nOh so ... H O the blessing to the radio off at first I couldn't believe what I was looking at so what we're saying is the biggest thing was as big as a small pony or you know your horse\nIt's an interesting thing was he led the CIA and just one that he said well you'd expect to host a London move forward because the the momentum this thing just one that I'm stuck like a magnet\nSudden something not to look at that it certainly was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen a steady lead them before you run away it's a pretty well known for\nWhat he said he could still do it to the being over seven foot

there was a guy I think it was in a in Cleveland or Boston or something [noise] about two years ago\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\nAnd ... and\nWhen the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids\nNot to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you\nThat actually I was\nJust such an offensive like first of all the you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and every year they X ray candies\nAnd it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I wanted her but\nI wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray or candy I mean\nReally do you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also\nI'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dance off an X ray the candy and and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost all you know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah I I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so they can feel the stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics here what we need to go back to the days when people to mommy for soles of of of you know predatory this you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] and then all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned\nIt was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restructure the British Isles or and then it came over with the with the first and second waves of ... of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nI'm ... and in fact the you we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course you know part of the the trials be Haiti and they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years I'm a court before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff\nUm you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know point though her right you'd\nActually have families coming together to make a gift costume ...\nAnd what you find is that the first um the ... the first record that I found up Halloween masks are really emerging about the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid in your past the oldest and stuff but what's happened that over and over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise\nAnd you know it's it's ... it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know [noise] the sexy police officer costumes or a drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you know and they're all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you study there's so much and you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well on us no good question you know I think that um you know\nWhen I mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we went to each\nIt raised with each you know a couple of generations changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far\nIn Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there's a certain innocence about it but I think is really peeling again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who doesn't like to dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kids love just eighty\nYear old kid like a dress up and so it's\nThere's something that is I think just inherently a humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and um you know it's still gonna be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years\nOr ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years now a ... there'll be a sort of your virtual or go if you know where you've\nGot like holographic you that you got a six year that he was like this giant thing that'd be cool\nThat trade that's what's going to be knocking at your door and that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we are going to
