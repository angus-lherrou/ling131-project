coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers\nOf science as his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell ah you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard and I was gonna say I had my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that and that's why I asked a at\nA later on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are\nAmongst I think in the elite group of science reporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in in a very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a lot to tell me and\nShe's a she's a frequent guest you're in the ... very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars and wish she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into these subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean yeah I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or ... for somebody like Larry King do hope that he will be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you huh\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I've kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in a in a sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth and so it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life of you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots\nThat third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's\nAbout what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world uh I tell for example the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nI met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I like the ... or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I became a man of faith faith\nI'm a Christian and I take my ... my face very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion\nAncient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist that's the basis of there are some innovations in this book

Harvard as well as the author and the new book is ah is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nThe idea of preserving physical lights are on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nTrying to get their hands on some DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know then we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised\nIn the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade and\nWe're drawing a trait in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow were to find the natural order of thing and he kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial Noel you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's nice it's nice to our Mother Nature\nYou know that one yet none nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for us right but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait were flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution\nRight where we do that if we take it on or who was going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back ... quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweet or orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to Hoover and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so forth and so on but he recently applied to the area and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robot powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but you know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah\nYou know ...\nYou write an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there is no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once posts about being very good at about well you know like you they're ... button it up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's what the day all singularity him one day we'll have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah and it I think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is let's use in a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know I using it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing

O. take your privacy back with my pseudo Rio\nMorning habits news radio seven ten doubled UNT em [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI Want to measure to leave some time to talk about future of privacy where we rest right now at this frontier of all of this home technology with Michael ... in a moment but I I wanted to wrap up\nThe conversation about uh about trends humans as you talk about them in the book people who are becoming part of something else or use physical um enhance Mintz from technology to be able to compensate for\n'em either for injury or for a deformity and there's a couple of those that are very entertaining like the guy with the built in by breeder and some of the other stuff that's\nIn the books but the part of it was really interesting and I just wanted to mention that because I I I think there does idea the ... skeleton I'm ... I Know several people who have a ... who have\nA trouble walking or the lost their ability to walk and they've been spinal injuries and and that this to them as a dream ... do you just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nOf I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually\nA movement a call the trans human movement where as you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories that the usable a trend human augmentation there's so there's usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power line when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms to the vet them right off\nNow here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neural cross the prostheses\nBut the these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms\nYou know that we are mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ... you know these are these are arms\nThat he can move with his thought so they're they're wired to\nMind that I like them isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you and even even and um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that\nYou know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with stuff there yeah where you know write it get it ... it you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell on the take some of that load off of their own yell at them but I think that the\nI think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robo cop more times than you have I mean I think that I mean and I do I'm not I'm not\nBeing facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can\nIf we could come up with the technology um that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that decades weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm about maybe\nSome of our advancements should not be consequence free\nIs that I think that that's you know I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me that I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then it never really it's a new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and uh you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogate going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go run there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon uh using their own that is just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes\nDo you get such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race so right\nYeah ... it in some ways you know\nIt that I often I often think to myself you know yeah all that technology is brand new it's unprecedented but\nWe had our just still the same you know so oh our faults in our ... our weaknesses\nAnd are downsides just get magnified by this technology is the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah\nConnor conundrum not the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war\nBecause you're over well by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism you know\nYou know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for some term in there but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to a gorilla her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going [noise]\nUh and his weaknesses but but positive person 'cause whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old had on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween you kind of moments right there were like All right now there's\nThis is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] [noise] yeah\nWell you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have so up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nBy that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert\nThe end of life as we know it might go deal in next on coast to coast am in for

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [laughter]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed a one story and the least look into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing the state's woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet chi walk and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and I'm like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece and and I think that's where great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right and you write up after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and they're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nThey um ... playing God is kind of baked into I D I F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense that it's a fair and ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be on the ... the the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be\nYeah I Will yeah yeah right well we'll give it a little plug for an up [laughter] they're I think the question you\nWere talking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about in mortality and when the rapid God is or out of a ...\nAnd and find it says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up and are they talking about this this area that you're talking where we've achieved get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse a you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it it I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian\nI'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I I'd love to think more about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does does a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or a mental experiment that people talk about a lot\n... it will reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it in the form of a big computer server or it\nIn the in the body of a among careless or a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and soul\nYawn ... you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it you know it's like the sky net running it's like running on on\nEnergy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the word from saying all sorts of crushed souls of the people at stumps on an ... you know getting ... getting some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great\nStop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so Jack Lew is exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal\nOn the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve the so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast am David\nGoing hey my question for your Stovall and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing these things artificial intelligence\nA new one would be the result\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good\nQuestion [laughter] yeah or if they do we just lose him and we just lost a\nOh no Well James is in the

either by pigs I'll take my answer off the air and\nHang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nBeyond he's on dialysis is on kidney stones and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's fight with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight is they'll not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but\nMaking enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that are already working on a second generation\nAh that will help actually restore\nSight the people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney front I don't think we need to create these by merit a there's a lot of great research and I've reported\nOn for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might\nCreate a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and uh through your choice will spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next on

here are very funny at least that's the theory behind\nParanormal activity witness that fine zero treat a can of his dispensary what's going to happen now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy ... next to it\nAs it was happening and I felt like somebody was standing there are like somebody that's like right\nHere suddenly the jar falls off the level surface that just happens then Andy remembered the surveillance handling salvage I\nNot long after that this happened watched the pen cup it's completely still and no one's around when suddenly the pans begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law ... certified videos GM

there\nBut that video ... especially ... and the fact that we were really got me was because it's a kind of a shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it as you want to jump in an open lines would love to have you let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina coast to coast to get us started Mike\nGood morning hours [laughter] we're

download horses could download mannerism can download action matched by robots now but it all again because you\nCan't show [laughter] so I guess some of the feelings and the personality of the uh [noise] I I'm with you in your it I mean we're the incidents in\nThe Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep right uh you know we can try to play God but I I I it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say that and it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were\nWhy wouldn't it have a soul if other people out there have you know\nUh other meant if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease\nYou know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology young soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about\nTest to babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi I'm I or world power guys first of all for not let in for five years I don't want to get too much into it but\nUm after ... ... and I I have a couple of things to say on this whole in March ... her and I'm a revival manner or would it have anything to eat it at that word it survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and that sort of firemen now and furthermore\nIn our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up for survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiling surprise for\nFor years to come for for some\nFamilies with multiple wives with multiple shoulder with multiple multiple and um\nAnd we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not we are usable and\nWe don't know even with training we don't know if\nThe supplies what's this phone somebody in a cave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt at all you like to um fallen scare myself not to\nA consuming somebody supplies but just to ... myself and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer a myself to\nGive her trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any knowledge of how to use the supplies to just hear somebody could even\nHis thing then sell an interesting you don't really know even with things like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know it's going to survive it could be a child\nIt could be a twelve year old kid who hasn't had any training on how the year the supplies that are stored up in homes are or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are\nA latter day saints and so I just really be a clear\nFor people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix a there's a series called uh like the men with three wives who were three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade\nA Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife and their the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab\nAnd um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and what it even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nA ... but uh yeah so Aaron's willing to be a volunteer but um I think the only fair if you get to bring your kid a John is in a in Kent, Ohio I knew well on coast to coast am done\nRather a I'm happy to have a you\nKnow I got a kick out of your commercial rocket ghost in the pawn shop in the record that was their name was Andy Gomez remember Gomez or the monsters\nYeah sure love Gomez I'm One of them at all [laughter] you know a now\nNow you mentioned the young lady mentioned about the woolly mammoth and you know Howard could survive a first of all wouldn't survive the five gee cellphone radiation or the country over today\nBy phone from getting back you know back in\nMay a coast to coast published and a picture of a police force that washed up

messy doesn't have ... doesn't have a dorsal fin it has a a very small mouth um [noise] uh so you know we're being led astray there now I I I'm On the phone number of things that I don't want to put up a lot of your time I'd regarding the caller about the mortality\nMcDonald's really kicked it off the hundred pound gorilla lay off more than fourteen thousand stores in the United states so they can source product more cheaply and they can sell dollar burgers and they might be able to actually turn a penny or to profit for their franchise use that Burger King there half\nThe size of McDonalds

that\nWell that's an interesting claim it that that the the marches on purpose or coordinated toured us I mean I I think that you'll always see migrations in the long history just bring up the Bible

of hundred times and this first time I've gotten through this is such a great privilege it if I can and I would like to to share something a ... about the Bible a\nAnd there's a great truth that we need to realize\nIn any discipline or\nAny discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be a Bible for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a big drink\nAnd the and the Bible is something to be studied and pondered over all three of the model the estate religions from the middle east began their roots what the Bible it and I'm quoting the ... the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the new this and the new ... the the ... yeah I mean the\nThe story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical\nValues a historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stores in the Bible a mini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nA historical value of the book of Daniel is so accurate\nAnd ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future is he is he did but\nThat that Cruz when you look at the courage there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the the Old Testament and the New Testament this has done so much for humanity you know\nOh I agree I agree we yeah we we stray\nAway from that and people and and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right the terrible whole book or you know and they'll\nUs called in and you know it's called proof texting and it's a yeah it's there's a\nThere's an old saying I've I've said it before I go to ... but as soon as the first in St learned in seminary was that some people\nUm some people rely on a on scripture\nI'm like a drunk leans on a lamppost not so much for illumination but for support\nAnd I think it's the illumination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just sounds like you're a learned guy but\nI did a I'm a I was writing I wrote an article about um about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told\nAnd I was interested in how many troops um how many murder stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform that the basis for that it starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what these murder stories still do\nWhat I found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder\nWith regard to Jesus they where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is that Jesus was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about him in a Judeo Christian\nContext but I'm just throwing that out yeah I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity\nHas a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies ... do you think that that has hurt us and gotten us away from a from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always been been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God and I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter]\nI'll take the bullet in protecting somebody else I'm a ... you know people go way far under their way to create these\nStructures were there shooting people killing other people in the name of God and I uh that's where I draw the line and join the conversation the rigging you've got a great town I'll let you get back to work too but\nUm last time I was in a

isn't that just ... and the fact that it's Islam where they say murder the Jesus was murdered yeah that's amazing it really is I don't know I'm ... go ahead\nWell I yeah I wanted to take us back to the Bible um I was telling the screener I'm a a for lack of a better term hardcore atheist and everything but ah I Believe in in you know seeing wisdom\nWhere you find it I I heard a whole lot of wisdom in the Bible and if you read it at the\nFive ... uh I I don't see much value but if you look at it is how people were thinking two thousand four thousand years ago\nUm it's fascinating I mean you read genesis and if you actually go back and look for you know the garden of Eden and you're going to be disappointed but if you look at it is you know what separates humans from the animal knowledge of good and evil consciousness felt for blacks and\nYeah and how how people we're dealing with that that fundamental truth back then and um\nYou know they were putting your own poetry behind it but they were saying this is what separates humans from animal and how\nYou know how do you balance good meat but once you understand it you know a cougar doesn't\nUnderstand good and evil wanted something you know it it it only does what it does in ... in animal does what it does and thankfully but as soon as yourself reflected your human\nYeah and it's really ... yeah I think this is an I

I'm more in line with Quakers and I'm fascinated with the idea of um\nThe beginning of an age when they've got to be occurring age began if their disagreement about\nThat as well yeah ours is that I'm going\nTo determine oh go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes\nI think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in for and this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and neo Marxism and you know all we could ever do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a date\nSo that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what's something that just otherwise you'll be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I looked it up several times and and it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it it's sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time they'll missing so called years\nI'm big because there's a lot of different books that address that I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all the book when I'm familiar with recovery right by your um ... I didn't want to a wrap it up quickly on there's a lot of could go after about her book but I wanted to say um I I agree with what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier whatever color\nYou are talking about the liar along the lines of\nIt if you create the freedom we have\nA we we all worship or something you know whether it's money or ... or whether it's got him or herself\nUm that we really appreciate that great and you're you're if you're working your way I I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside to that for sure but I did it because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use it responsibly\nOh yeah we have a buddy not where I felt individually but could we got a collective we\nCouldn't agree more to have some kind of shared values\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a country is a I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance of security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut when people talk about it the border that makes as a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona and write or soon to be a a a cans and isn't a like didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have ... ... there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we've got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to young philosophy should be where every education starts I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country\nI think that's what we need to always focus on that's the that's the most important thing other things are also important but that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot\nAh for people who don't find it interesting pardon the bladder but gosh darn it that was great thank\nYou so much for jumping in an open lines and look forward to tomorrow night so the most elusive serial killer\nIn history\nAnd you'll be shocked and in fact the author\nVery well might have solved this case [noise]\nGlitter make that decision I Want to think a George ...

explain that coming up later on okay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils I I don't know your ... believe me there there's a lot to talk to a an about coming up\nOn coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it\nOminous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from an ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's\nFan Michael well ah you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day I was gonna say my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked it a bit\nLater on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in elite group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing terrific tell me and\nShe's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nA ... or packing for Mars and was she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very good at it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into these subjects because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list them urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you'll pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family and ... and but I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear\nFor somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life relocating science they try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that I walked me had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories are on and so forth and so on\nBut yeah I got to be honest with you that like old school um what I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and they downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAgo and I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their accents and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in the near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran ... are being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars devolved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nAncient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't

reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as author and the new book is ah is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which might be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics\nAnd and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life uh on this planet is like whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nUh trying to get their hands on from DNA from you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all\nYou have to ask you know then we really want to do this and there's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts alright do come under the category of genetic engineering\nWhy we're doing in is something that's never been done before and\nThat is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're the drama of traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure\nWe're defining the natural flow were to find the natural order of thing and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you know don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice it's nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yet none nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for us right but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits in suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he can't\nDo that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right where we do that if we take it on or who who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your elephant\nYou know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do buy\nSlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about this guy I think his name is Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so forth and so on but he recently applied to the our son was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look\nIf we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt ... it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots powered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect\nGod because they know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok\nAnd you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIt is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded\nTo be the most complicated game most ancient game around go you know ... you\nWrite an artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off or you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean ... it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we post about are we once boasted about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... buttoned up by saying\nGenerally like he was still pretty small but you know one day they're general like he was or seem to be even greater than ours that the day of the singularity that's for a day and all and ... when they will have the equipment I you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah I think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is which you use it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's to say that that that average you know accusing it a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo out like that the cushy ... yeah I'm right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquer the crazy with that the right now I fully believe that completely and it and let's pick this up coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendship [noise]\nI think our life as we

here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell ah you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard and I was gonna say I had my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why a ... a a\nA later on a ... you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are\nAmongst I think in the elite group of science reporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way um I we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing a lot to tell me and\nPlay you know she's a she's a frequent guest here in the ... very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars and was she talked she tried to learn what it'll be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is just very I Love it you know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories and everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about the students to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your listeners urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ...\nBut I mean yeah I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate in the few huh\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I tried to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to you have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically\n[laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that as far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I've covered the cryogenic story over the years\nAh you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head a frozen and ah with with the hope one day of uh of being brought back to life the head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I got in a in a sense that\nNow with what's going on with robotics and so forth and saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots\nThat third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so between genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nTime and I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not that big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really\nAbout what's going on right here and right now even as we speak in ... in labs all over the world I tell for example the story of Iran must uh being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars these involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it it's so I became a man of
