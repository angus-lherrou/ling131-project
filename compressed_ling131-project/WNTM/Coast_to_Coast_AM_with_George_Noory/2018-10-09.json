age by Romney Lon mosques delete Stephen Hawking they were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I'll say this what what they're worried about a was mentioned earlier which is a kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on a simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain is ... machine in your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a new chemical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley uh my probably cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nBit that may be more that than they do is a lot more harm than than than good if it's ... it's very little suggest the machine\nWill do that now through through accidents are absolutely you know you had a rocket blow up because a single one was a transposed with a ... opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you\nHad a um you could have an airline pilot had a heart attack about bad for one air air airplane for people thank thank God you got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying\nA network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through our systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one that they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross and the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\n... ... is that the human being\nThe main thing that feels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist to make sure you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer a big thought that very interesting reason which was\nNew and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up his face up his face up to space up to space it's delivering the good it it can it if you out of business you can make probably any department in your business than ten percent faster than percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now\nHave the technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more inventions and I ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense has a ... they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nThat's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that response to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary ah yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said ah there's a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a petite ... or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it was up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniffer gunpowder\nAnd you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to um if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that\nFights wars and instead of people um there there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a ton of mass killings systems I think it's disingenuous\nDebate is I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budget sitter spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic Gunter it that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave before I shoot 'em\nAnd it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally it didn't ah they only put that in because people requested it and show or it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou can always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're gonna for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build\nA a weapon systems it's going to happen\nWell for for three very easy reasons you could argue that ah they're they're better they're more effective it their mission and there'll be less collateral damage and wherever they are you then argue that you\nWill be saving lives of soldiers ...\nA ... and ... and whatever country you are and and and third you know they will they will work and be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost going to war which\nUh is is not not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nAh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if ... has no cost a then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see the day though by run that you know we're coming up to the top of the hour ... finishes up when we come back next hour but you know we've got drones delivering packages were talking about artificial like cars with driverless cars

and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do a what a way to do you know they ... you you still a drink you know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThere you have a special order and you want you want to send your food back or something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone in an adult yeah so\nWell the correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nUh people are going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of move but generally going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your well out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I Am happy when it gets that right when it doesn't get a an age and ate all mixed up so that's kind of wherever that I'm not like you said that oh you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true ... it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative whether a computer\nAnd it may be that that you have to experience the world\nIn order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these by ... which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but somebody your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause there's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project\nTo try to take this little worm you got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model out of the computer just make a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people who have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we we are so\nSpectacularly amazing\nUh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages week already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick\nHumans did which is technology which is multiplying what we are able to do\nAnd and we've used it to overcome scarcity because for all of human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed the productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action about what it means is it you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause\n'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't um then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us a division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented a nation state and that's why five dollars and years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go over the world and so I Do think that\nUm that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how the bond will be er a by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or you're ...\nYou're right that is already Fishell intelligent you it is I I had to be\nFrightening if you if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all\nNot at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are filling up bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it to Nineteen\nThere was a series of commercials on I don't know if you remember it in the nineties that someday you will you know should the facts from the beach someday you will and all of the things in those commercials\nKind of thing for the army did stay with us by when you come back and take some calls in a final trap next on coast to coast down\nThe coast website is no streamlined for mobile devices Greek news if your ghost inside a roof simply want to enjoy her website on your phone visit coast to coast am dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or\nWell no one on Facebook click on that little news radio seven ten dot com [laughter]\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute the prospect of higher interest rates will likely be top of mind for stock traders today after fed chair Jay Powell last week reiterated the prospects that future interest rate hikes bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Michelle Meyer says the strong economy is driving rate's higher\nAny Powell was very adamant in that respect that and the prospects for granted there are strong and and the fed has tightened it can continue to hike unless they're told otherwise by the data and and again markets are believing it\nBonds resume trading after yesterday's holiday with the yield on ten year treasuries that three point to three percent the highest in more than seven years today the INS present since world economic outlook together with the world bank in Indonesia Google unveiled its newest pixel smartphone another hardware in New York in Paris\nThe national federation of Independent Business issues its latest reading a small business optimism at least a parental Bloomberg Radio\nInternational superstar twenty six year old Bruce Springsteen too heavily promoted major legal Abu see hind him nothing approaching a popular ...\nAnd also this week in Nineteen Seventy five Saturday Night live debuts on NBC featuring Chevy Chase jumble ooh she Dan Ackroyd Gilda Radner\nGarrett Maurice Jane Curtain and ... it will go on to become the longest running highest rated show on late night TV Ninety minute program which from its inception had been broadcast live includes a different guest hosting musical acts each we allergy and hearing\nCenter mobiles studio film soldiers making the world to your ... does is use radio seven ten W.

to be that there are there are lots of problems that aren't technical like there's hatred bigotry and all of that but there are certain things we just haven't figured out how old are you in disease how do you slow down aging how do you do all these things and so\nThey're suffering people around the world that just are waiting for technology to come through and\nAnd finally deliver on all the

Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\n... thanks for having me on the shelves missing interesting topic I\nI just wanted to ask your guest there or if you think that the way technologies progress thing that we may get to that and your to your age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings 'cause working alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know you don't Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go up to ... just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody\nLived in Nineteen thirty Bel Air conditioning six hundred square feet they'll medical insurance no higher education vacation grow your own food make your own clothes you worked Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human wants it turns out so even in the future of people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly the the time we save at home but not holy water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies but it turns out we've always work forty hours\nA week if if if our productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now Byron this technology\nUm I I think that question I asked earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine a\nFixed by rote probably could've machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or what we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\n... care than they've been here for more than now and they can't pay for and and ... ... ... ... ...\nAnd ... with that and him and then ... and ... it gets half the fan out with and now they're\nTalking about automatic guns well okay I Know you're you're\nThe guest barb is entirely right uh we are using a economists weapons were killed decisions of course we've done that\nSince landmines wheat crop withdraw dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines to kill a so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we built machines that that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more advanced systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decided that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions that part I agree with you\nBefore the age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just visit Iran reach dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to out June\nJune very simple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income\nPer capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventeen fifty nothing happened what if you look starting seventeenth fifty is shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we date the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of well created a eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen\nIs all purely technical problems like disease and hunger you will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming or all kinds of people said it would be possible but um\nYou know this country the United states already Throws Away enough food to feed the hungry people\nIn the world no question that the world strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do solve all these kinds of illnesses and diseases that wouldn't be traumatic more to come on coast to coast

and data\nAnd and I'm and I'm known you know within the organization is being in a very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories um they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you would make this up\nYou know you're the you're the nerd you wouldn't be stuff [laughter] and um I Would say Ninety nine point nine percent

choice um but I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could to interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so\nYou know people could feel liberated to just to tell their do you have talked about their experiences 'cause there's so many people have had him and I also wanted them\nTo you know I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that people are all into the ... and

just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go\nBecause I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes for tiger fee a little bit of that medium ship just you know some of those things are a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans believe and goes\nSo we're almost the majority were barely a minority and that's grown I bet\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I

two seconds\nSo none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey either way I

with the the eight to ten years prior to it 'cause it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd opened a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's\nLike oh my gosh it goes were older guys what am I done 'em and and then I started the aging you know the house the

devil\nBashing the day when he tried to Adam and Eve away from God to today\nYou get scratched out of the book of life and so\nClearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked about the astro planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line\nOn is when this can happen again it's just a theory\nAre pretty good it's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have at our bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark but dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think

was how her my name is Ron and I went he he said what he said\nHow hurt my name is wrong because I notice that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my step dad who was not very nice and I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him I don't think it was my extent that but I think it was the ... man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know if\nAnybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare you they're going to find that thing that triggers you\nRight there and find that deep dark thing they're going to find who was the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that and and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accept it didn't even know his
