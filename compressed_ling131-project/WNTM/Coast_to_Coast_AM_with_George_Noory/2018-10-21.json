east of Fairbanks as we keep track of the swarming earthquakes\n\nAnd of course we're in the political season\nThis is an interesting poll according to CNN after the first presidential debate the question was who do you believe to be more honest Dole or Clinton the answer\nUm Dole over fifty percent Clinton around thirty percent\nSo the people that are saying ... is the more honest of the two candidates\nBut then I asked who would you vote for the answer do twenty eight percent Clinton fifty eight percent\nNow this says something does it not\nAbout the American electorate\nOn the one hand in question one they are asked who is honest and only a third of the people say President Clinton but\nThen they're asked who are they going to vote for and two thirds of the people just about say President Clinton now in my way of thinking this says more about the people surveyed\nOr if you wish to believe it representative the electorate than it does then it does about the candidates\nAsked a buy Newsweek who is the more negative or nasty Dole gets about two thirds fifty nine percent Clinton eleven percent both of them Thirteen percent\nWho has better character to be President Clinton gets forty eight percent do thirty six percent and ten percent of the people said it makes no difference at all\nAm going to make my prediction for the election what I think is going to happen and mostly if I'm right or wrong I haven't done very well with the stock market so there is no reason to believe this will be accurate but here is my prediction for what it's worth\nBill Clinton is going to be reelected if not in a landslide than by grapes margin\nRepublicans will hold Congress now I'm not sure about this one but I Believe and I will predict the Republicans are going to hold Congress by a very slim margin\nThe Senate will remain safely in the hands of the Republicans are within a seat or two at the most\nWithin a year after the election the Clinton Administration is going to in my estimation be buried\nIn scandal so that takes my prediction about a year out from the election I Believe Bill Clinton's good when Republicans are going to hold on both houses of Congress and that within a year a lot that has been suppressed before the election is going to begin to come out\nAnd the president is going to be in trouble somebody sent me a bumper sticker was mark I don't know

the polls and here we are\nUnder two weeks now till election day\nThey have widened for Bill Clinton not the other way around a you would certainly expect them to be typing up by now but in indeed they are instead widening and I wonder what you make of that\nNothing bomb dull has done including the most recent fund raising a allegations and some of those are very serious about liberal the

Mars ABC CBS and ... and uh NBC mhm\nI I think they have a very big buyers and I I don't know there there's all kinds of newspapers and they're all ... all kinds of different media and all that but uh most people I mean there's all kinds of polls that also say that most people do get their news from TV and they believe what they see on TV\nThat is true and I I think that's a shame\nWell I appreciate your culture and we'll see what others have to say\nI'm so you think that people are taking their cue from the media it is true that more people to not get their news from the media from the major media\nAh what do you think what are the rest of you think the uh ... taken by the ... campaign of late has been to attack the president with regard to the donations made by the Indonesian company\nA liberal do you think of why do you think that is not to\nGetting traction as an issue and why the polls continue to widen for Bill Clinton why do you think that is do you share that

elected\nAnd you think he's going to run again\nUm I don't know uh it's a good question he may allow another candidate a to head the reform party\nNext time and I I really think it's it comes down to that that he will allow because if he runs he will be the candidate yeah in my opinion so uh if you set the reform party lose we may get a ... another candidate next time\nOK and just one thing when you had the the two candidates from the\nThe other parties like uh the libertarian yes\nThing I'm scared about that this guy gets in there and see if they have their way you can imagine that the sweatshop Thirteen year old girls are working twelve hour shifts a lot of safety features will go out the window let alone or legalizing drugs which I think it's crazy\nI uh we have to have some government yeah\nI I Do agree sir I Believe me I Do agree\nI Am very much in the middle and I do agree I Am not able to embrace libertarian philosophy and I really really really like Harry brown use the real thing he believes in what he says I just happen not to agree with all of it\nAre two important non trivial points one is legalize drugs very bad idea in my opinion and the other is open

it in a locker ... and I thought\nWell I can imagine you know doing it if they found pot or heroin or something like that and there but um\nI Know aspirin seems radical yeah I went on the other hand uh there there's a reason for the rules thank you for the call [noise]\nUm it it does sound a little rough but suppose the other students had to have some sort of allergy to that medicine then there would have been a real problem\nThere would have been a real problem and I suppose that's why they have the rule or a little bit strict yes but probably proper and they wanted the school nurse to

thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that you know why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychics but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychic or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little bit I don't think they wanted to kill him\nBut I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um that young student who had been on the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right\nIn there and have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but this time with this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um\nYou know you had those problems than his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out and they would find people and they would see the show and he would\nFind a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak\nAnd he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know they say on the weather would ever where the hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and the lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and and the you know the fake\nMedia would be totally surprise you and he'd say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys are very sick and\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled a psychics mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I\nMean that guy had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it would just I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a circle sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly go and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and

Houdini afterlife experiment it didn't work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com or time is tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nAnd his healing processes hated by painkillers and some of this is a more of the end he becomes addicted them more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on hum with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my oh James Pike up yes it was up here on on I'm In Canada upon are now a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yes\nYeah yeah and I think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on what if he did with all the secret to complete three is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on his Thomas or I Am not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voice over I T line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into this ... this is getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water for this case Houdini case as fun as it is and as exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just that it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA I'm\nOn the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years as long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through\nOr are there for ... been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and\nSo I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nCheer 'em and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nTell the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will

I was right on the money with the right\nBut as you as you are and make great pains to point out and he just mentioned this earlier that the Germans and there'd be T.

Mussolini at first it was an ... Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but\nYou know again I'm history books being what they are that tends to build the last um\n[noise] so America gets into the war and Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more than a month every night\nUm people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of the tree and in Birmingham a very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way [noise]\nUm anyway uh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do a stone at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was\nThere how close England came to losing the right one they were lined up on the other side of the\nDay being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel and this was what their MO was they used to go and laid on airstrikes bomb them into oblivion and then just paper on your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well\nEspecially with France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain that of course because of you know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war\nAnd now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the British\nNow all of a sudden we get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them\nI'm of course to admit previously and I'm sure she'll really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with you chose the one who\nGather together but he he just pay the fact that the Americans because they were so similar at the time that style and in America and the American\nPresident FDR were working in unison on this it was great for the war it was bad for the world\nBecause Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we want to be from\nShow to answer your question around about fashion um church show like that for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to become a small one only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was of course you have to understand we weren't\nGetting things from Russia we didn't know much about the rape purge I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on he wouldn't have been a strand of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight in the New York times where they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure calling us I mean there's ...\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying their faces a ... billion\nFDR it seemed a ... and reading a book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burned establish playing a little hard to get\nStoned and need us we need it's balanced island in the U.S he was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pass\nStyle and of course we know as Hitler and its installing hit a pack well Hillary violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind and they were on their march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march\nAnd then you know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now Hitler's leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so uh of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the time he was on like\nThirty some odd different drugs so he was\nSuch a delusional dictator at the at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch course in midstream and go towards styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and he'll just says\nWell I don't care I Want to do it so styling is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little harder to get and he certainly was so when we really had to go begging at his style on the table and wish to get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think in a restaurant in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct they have that even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world\nAh and still at this point you know I I think she was Roosevelt still it's pretty robots\nOr you know he you know by by standard to Nineteen forties he was an older guy by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy um but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads hitting that we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read

even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred of for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen how did it come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him killed because I think that the people these fake\nPsychic or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to wrap them up a little bit\nI don't think they wanted to kill him but I think they wanted to say back off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might spend some money to get that um\nThat young student who had down the boxing team\nTo punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right and he would have them come up to the

oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nI think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAfter a couple of years it was the oil wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claimed that he

essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment it didn't work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com that time is tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James hike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it and I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how let's say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the it would only do three is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on us Thomas or I Am not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe OK\nI'm area it's actually a voice over I T line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James ... this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV yes\nAnd and he does a little upfront research brings it into the sand and says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went to his papers and found his research preparing for this thing and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water for this case the Houdini case as fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium Mm abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my account but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know that first they were going to do it down in the building but then they said let's do that on the Doppler will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years as long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're\nInclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through or are there for it has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that you wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it and she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and

about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and\nSo um\nThat kind of got him going and so he has an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do so he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately will get got him
