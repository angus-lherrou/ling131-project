C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military\nAnalyst group and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of uh items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security\nAdviser John Bolton is reportedly are pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the ion air for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians are respected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I in the treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that a wave tractor cruise missile recalled nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria are of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe powerful renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and\nIt should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow cause of concern to solve it you know that his cutting back dramatically a nuclear weapons are and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear\nHolocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how\nChina and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology\nThat is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred\nA surface to air missile system\nAnd the the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate you know I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against Jimmy a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did ... and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of\nA civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's a after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania that'd be entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin uh the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that um they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nSide for the interruption I gotta jump in here will take us

satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as a true competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military\nIt's economic it's diplomatic ah it's\nAll these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information\nA appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nThey're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor their own population\nAnd of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on\nYou know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a pawn in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I supposed to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates um be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five\nYou know somewhere around there and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know I ... to the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes yeah and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder ... with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these friends\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states uh to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course they could show the um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm and how that might mean there is there are dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering what ... what are your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states where the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his little Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that their cars so sugary situation is is tragic\nBut if you've been watching Muhammad then psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nThe so called ... and the the desert

have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course they could go to the Chinese are Russians but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with and of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians in Chinese or a lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime um they're all ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh\nThat uh certainly in the west where not all excited about uh but the reality is that um [noise] you know a friend of my you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is my friend or something like\nThat that the idea being that we we have to have partners in that part of the world it's a dangerous a game that the airplane we see that evolved\nOver the years in Iraq we see it in Syria you know even you know vitamin ... and I would just welcome a president of the sea of Egypt up into Moscow for his fourth\nVisit in the last couple of years and you know they made big arms deals and they're talking nuclear power plant in ... uh for these sorts of issues are on the forefront if we banned in the ...

Decatur a destroyer\nA in the grave and race in the south China Sea um the Chinese warship came only a few meters away from it\nAnd just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos flew over um you know the contested area in the south China Sea people need to understand\nThat um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for their jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from that these are claimed 'em by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well\nAs the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air is I've indicated and of course they have their neighbors to the west I'm terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to forward station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we call them and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent the Assad regime [noise] uh and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of even though we know where they came from and what they did\nWell Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario a it is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the big dog mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president el Sisi of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that\nAir to one who is the current president of turkey is really a seeks to be the collie and to establish a collar fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently\nAh was after great pressure we put on him a air to want to cooperate with us but yet we find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there\nYeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has a any consistently has had over the years a very ambitious\nThoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that so that these are issues Syria is\nYou know clearly something that everyone is watching he's collaborating with Russians who of course uh even though there are some friction there that they are working together and of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together you see the Iranians certainly the Turks are sort of our lives the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning\nTo show up and even Syria hoping to kind of lick their chops and and put together that country wants a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so a lot of players here are confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nYou mentioned her to one and I wanted to ask you about turkey did they belong in NATO even at this point\nThat's a fair question I don't think so my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to put our fourth division through turkey into northern Iraq through ... to attack\nSaddam you know a good ally would've allowed that to happen of course had her ... her to won didn't want that to happen they blocked us and we ended up having to take all those troops to who was up to the Gulf into Kuwait\nUm air to want is not being a cooperating of course they're purchased the F for hundreds a surface to air missiles from the Russians\nAre they're being pretty cozy with the Russians of late or even purchased a long term nuclear power plant on the med from the Russians and of course as we've seen elsewhere as soon as you have a operational power plant much like they have a in downtown to run\nA and on the coastline there then you can begin to make a\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what everyone wants alternately\nWhether it's just too rich so the the the the turkey is\nBuying um\nAir defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO extensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that you know because we will not connect our patriots and other fat to a Russian as four hundred\nUh that's why there's a it's a non ... we just won't do it uh and that is a major um bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it a witness Islamic viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire [noise]\nYou know Palestine and so forth and you know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a uranium through wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and\nThey have a long history I Would hope they will replace their autocrats with people that have a a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going\nBut we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the hobbits were sort of seen as a counter measure to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects and

you're going to turn to give people year we're still lives there in that he did go work through or wrong or\n[noise] you know well I sort of a question in their Richard ... it is it is perspective um you know I think that the the history of\nThe Russian a Soviet Union certainly where they killed millions a hundred mile in China where they kill millions\nA and their foreign policy where they provoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support ah yeah we do sell weapons are defense security cooperation agency has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nWe we've made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like\nUh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is a we don't have any friends we just have interest and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself and to prosper\nUm sometimes are in the eyes of the beholder it is is evil or certainly in my perspective on I've you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I looked at their history and I look for the one today and it's certainly not what my country once\nAnd I do believe a United States is not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects\nA freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization\nWhich you look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world they don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded the individual you can be literally swept off the street in the middle of the night and executed\nUh for for no reason in most places in the world\nA and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in was\nIn a western China today and that's a un report or somebody can look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that in the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong and we've acknowledge that\nWe do bad things but the rest of the world you know I have\nI've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places\nAnd yet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to the United states where we enjoy the rule\nOf law we aren't afraid is Richard

I don't happen to believe it that's just me but he was one of the things that sort of bothers me about that situation and that is if we in fact we choose our circumstances\nWhy would someone choose for example\nA to reincarnate into a life that leads ultimately to physical abuse doesn't that almost place the the the burden on the victim in that case saying well you were you chose that life\nOkay there are certain experiences that we learn from and yes I I understand where you're going and and I and I really do feel for the people that do choose a life like that it is a way of learning certain things and please remember we do have free will\nAnd there are times when people will uh advice us in the in the physical to get out of those relationship\nThose relationships if it's a pattern that a person has to learn from [noise]\nThen they may have to go through it but there's always the chance that they can leave those relationships or we leave 'em I I I understand that when when the child is young but there's no place they could run into\nA because it's if it's parents siblings and there's a ... and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous ... a\nCircumstance is yes it is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what we're overcoming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also it's for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of abuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well and usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them\nThat this is the role that they will take and it's up to those two people that come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern\nSo we can see the negative of it but there are cases where people rise above themselves and they become a hero in their own life because of the person that they may have abused as they've been abusing\nThey may educate them somehow so there's always hope here and yes we do have gone to an angel with that do help us\nIt is up that we is up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angel thing guys\nAll right Joe thank you for that [noise] a friend is on the wild card line she's in Clearwater, Florida ...\n[noise] yes thank you for taking my call Richard up three weeks ago I asked your help in winning a roof\nOh yeah ...

C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two\nColonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analyst group and his brand new book is called an alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times\nFinally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly\nUh pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\n[noise] well of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I in a treaty because they have\nA not only build but practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that that we've tractor cruise missile we call the nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria and of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of the twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because it it should concern to solve it\nYou know that has cut back dramatically a nuclear weapons are and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has really cross\nThe line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets and the U.S we're entering a new era right now\nI Want to also dial back to September when Russia began its largest ever military exercise with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology\nThat is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred\nA surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War when President Reagan had essentially vanquished or when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later\nAssurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the bear\nAnd given their their passion\nFor for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since Peter the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been allies but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard huh we did ... and of course we've continued to do that they considered\nA Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\n\n\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute call it a space race among the airlines\nAll the airlines really have to show you when it comes down to it you\nKnow you are scary years are racing

they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're we're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just the military\nIt's economic it's diplomatic\nAh it's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our

um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that a country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's\nLeading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there\nUm and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're

P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analysts\nGroup and his brand new book is called ... and the alliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me refusing\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security adviser\nJohn Bolton is reportedly are pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the INS for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nOf course the Russians are respected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven I in a treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of below strict and cruise missiles forever range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that where your tractor cruise missile recalled nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria are of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow\nAbout that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because it was a concern to solve it\nYou know that his cutting back dramatically a nuclear weapons are and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threats posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began his largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand to think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates\nHow China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met\nAnd they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology\nUm that is of course being shared a significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying a fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred\nA surface to air missile system\nAnd the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia\nStraight at the United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against ... clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have\nThe mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passions for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation\nUm coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who we would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\n\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered\nA Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania that'd be entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know potent of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has you know really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that um they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we\nAside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal why should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um\nCovert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been
