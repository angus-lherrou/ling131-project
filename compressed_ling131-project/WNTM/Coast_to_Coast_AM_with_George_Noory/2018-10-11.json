including the field and the intention experiment in a way it is the power of eight\nLynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results that few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when a several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or they could hit as a category four or five and we did a little over let's bring it down and it the hit hit a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it works and\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now\nWe've run about peace intention experiments trying to lower violence um last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not a a\nA neighborhood in St Louis Missouri Jesse ... and we calculated the result Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor it did take a look at it from the University of California\nAnd she saw that\nClimbing up the St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis as a home property crime went up went\nUp in the ground and neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent for before and it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so it's going on here\nWhat do you think this is what people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there\nWhat what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's it\nQuantum energy field and what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our ... everything is energy and our thoughts are another kind of energy when there\nAre worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster\nTo purify water healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and you know of those thirty three twenty nine have shown measurable positive significant effects\nDesigner trend the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to\nBe honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug has his good record is that in terms of studies so so as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together\nThere is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now maybe he'll thing\nThe experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I Lived in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the deep pack of the middle east\nAnd also very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so we had eight in Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know ... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic and it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does added to play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we didn't intention once for a kid call Luke who was Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide is through and so forth of forty foot\nStructure after is he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live but he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated\nBut here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid it worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica it's who is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable and then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with\nDr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had\nFour sets the seeds and we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientist didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that\nThey really helped me set up because they're the scientists and then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate or I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to\nTo do the intention and I'll be made out of my uh Internet site or YouTube or own Web TV or radio you and I did one together\nAnd um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results\nAnd the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if you just do it\nA week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nIndeed no bloom the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group for the test why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will the town of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments\nI wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of you know groups small groups in my workshop you know will\nWill they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and I was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop because this is back in two thousand and eight and then I wasn't I hadn't really\nWe're came Michael international trade and rising interest rates Michael Houston up see 'em see markets told Bloomberg Radio it's unusual but stocks and bonds have declined simultaneously\nWhile we're expecting is much higher us rights ... to weigh on the U.S economy and I think it's not really surprising new you're getting settled in bones and a federal stalks\nThe couple of closely followed reports will be released in Washington before the markets opened this morning economists surveyed by Bloomberg the consumer price index rose to ... percent last month and they are looking for a small uptick in the number first time claims for unemployment benefits for last week\nThe weekly updates on consumer comfort mortgage interest rates crude oil supplies and natural gas inventories will be out shortly after the start treaty ...

you feel like you're part\nOf something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely

to looking at immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this but one of the other big\nPieces of this I talked about it with altruism\nWas the University of California Berkeley\nWho did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments and they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve\nIt's the longest nerve the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on\nUm things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies and\nThen the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that we um you know we\nWe actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why not Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to the Israelis they found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas nerve also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing

of stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was\nAmazing to me was what happened to the participants in these intention experiments so when we started doing these peace experiments\nI started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly\nI asked them how it was for them and I was getting answers back like this um I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was she ringing and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beam in Star Trek and remember these are people who are participating\nIn their own home in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives they were getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with so that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing\nWhen we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nOh in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment it's not the outcome that's
