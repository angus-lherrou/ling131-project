population is than being weaponized they're being encouraged to just ignore due process\nYou know and treat the people involved like their metaphors and and ... and not based on the law are due process but just on sort of emotional lobbying and that's scary because that kind of weaponization of the population can take a very and places\nYou know I had to when the Gramm had a ramp during the\nTime I thought oh my God I'm agreeing with Lindsey Graham is truly frightening [laughter] but you know he basically said he turned to the Democrats and he said you you better not get power because he can't handle it\nSo I you know it's very and I I Will say this I think both sides have increasingly done it and the population is increasingly allowed themselves to be weaponized so you know the reality is is is you know these people are not metaphors they're individuals and you have to judge them according to the evidence and according to the law\nAnd I'm now where does this come out I think that Kevin ... is going to be confirmed\nAnd ... if he isn't confirmed as some of the moderates filled out it's because if you you know if you do a deep dive into his record what it says he's he's a little bit more loyal to the establishment in the constitution so I think he is apt to sort of bend the law to help the ... the establishment of the government go where they want to go\nAnd that's what's going to give some of the moderates you know problems and so but my guess he he's going to be confirmed probably this weekend and what's interesting about this is the impact that will have on the election\nUm and I think one of the things it's done is it's really galvanized the Republican base because there\nAre you know two weeks ago they were concerned about Trump's personality now you know in his tweeting now they're not they're concerned about what would happen if the um you know if the Democrats had the leadership position\nDo we do we all loses people because of all of this\nAny any time any one of the things talks\n... supports the violation if due process\nUm we we put our whole culture and our whole system in jeopardy and the whole our whole financial

year highly lawless\nProcess where I was targeted and and you know efforts by government people to frame me mhm and what what\nSaved me George was that I literally you know I went to the process and safe\nAnd what happened was there were so many people inside the FBI or the department of justice or the different agencies involved or my attorneys or the general population who really believed in the law and it was their belief in the law that ultimately saved me\nSo we need to believe in it it's every one of us and um you know I think I think that\nA lot of the people uh you know who've allowed themselves to be weaponized do oh ah oh an apology to\nTo everybody involved or everybody had to give testimony and I certainly think the leadership that the Congress those American

I moved to Minneapolis a Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there\nFamily still there I have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my motive motorcycle accident\nWhile you're born I really yeah well you\nTold me where cars you must remember the the the street\nOh I don't I don't know who was ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kind of over\nAre we going to I'm gonna I'm gonna close my eyes and yes you'll remote dealing now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear miss viewing skill near Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its roots in your ... year my gosh\nYeah well thank you my friend I preach\nShe'll do this all really steer you in the direction where you are no I mean you've got a PHD and social anthropology you've just been elected vice president of the tourist psychological shows you usually get into that but this would lead the foundation for you\nWell I think it really started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and what timers the Detroit\nUh-huh good one oh really so that is right downtown no um [noise] well I discovered to books when I got into college in the first one was Thomas Coons book\nCalled the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this\nYou know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that\nUm maybe it wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality so that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration\nBy Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen out you're not ready and\nI didn't apply for the job at no at sciences but it was about ... Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe show for your university no\nThat's right we are looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological Len\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that kind of notion that there are aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right\nIt is and he really really\nWell it's you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ...\nBrewery which you'll remember remember the Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nDo they do they still college which beer you know I Know I haven't really uh gobbled up it's been a yes or Hampshire\nRight although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat would it be you know what have you learned about\nDeath experiences above the other side what what can you conclude at this point\nWell I Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and pays a thin that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your a culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intentions of very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to ... you know make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something you know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish\nThose dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any suing the still baffles you wear on [laughter]\nEvery day more and more [laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures expect from the world and\nYou know being in the Amazon

consciousness\nBut if you can bolster their sense of a personal worth their ... their value in the world and you you enhance their self esteem you'll see that when you trigger them they actually become more optimistic they care about other people\nSo I think if we can approach this idea of death and the great mystery of it with an open heart and that kind of skepticism that is productive\nI think you can become a great exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win no did you did you know agree Mitchell before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked\nWith him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with\nHim for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because he was a person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment\nWhen he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find [laughter] um but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving unkind toward other people than it was to spend a lot of time worrying about what's going to happen next and I just thought that you know it's a powerful notion and he was a great man\nWe're descended of evidence to prove that there's life after death if you are like quarter law ... knew this was challenged debts was challenged could you prove that there's life after\n[noise] so this would make a great reality show and I love Ina courtroom let's do it [laughter]\nSo you have a judge in a jury and you have people representing different points of view on controversial topics so take this one you know life after death and you have these people arguing their various position\nWhich witnesses the common goal\nExactly giving their own um personal testimony based on their experiences\n... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what would shift to people's\nMind about that question and is it the data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and\nShowed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting you know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something\nYou know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think she'll to Dr Merrill Lynch which were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and the rule but it plays with all this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness and also\nOur lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts we live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that shapes her experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world\nThat we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of the functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level and to the extent we can\nYou know turn the light on what those experiences are and what Shapes Our awareness where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness Lou outside of the brain\nI Do I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting it is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and\nSee that as consciousness manifest in the forest because every ... is filled with life and with that intention to manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness as something much bigger than our individual brain\nI don't think it's an ... phenomenon of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like\nYou know the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the or the signal
