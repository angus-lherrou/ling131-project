thousand point reversal from down nine hundred to ... eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look\nThis is a reversal this is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that um and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much ...\nAre there for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses it the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not good to when I was just going to even\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and they may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea\nWhich would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired up elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so are there were peaking now or it best when Trump holds on and noticed that we're going to peak late next year and see the

generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing\nWith the biggest Boston bubble burst all ready has been in commodities and things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent\nThere's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers\nAnd consumers they spend much more of their money there so you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yet but next but between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three\nIs going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only difference on George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people\nWhen they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan and places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes and young people at the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back in a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry ... dot com and that's going to be best place to be the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to pay for everything eighty three two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to comment we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to to the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption or around the world man makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time\nAnd and when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and ... and it's a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be getting in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this\nIs going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so [noise] so I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise]\nThe the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and I think that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk to but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward and all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this\nWe're gonna take your deposits and we're going to burn them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank so this is in in in even in Australia that people are realizing\nThey're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHappened in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen to people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's something we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr debt I Want to ask about Puerto Rico

E. R. dot com\nI I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts [noise]\nThey're gonna have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured um except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and that may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're gonna have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans or to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare they're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay well if we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going\nThis bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nInto thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars in a voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nIn a ... you know permanent quantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send them money to every day people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they just sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger\nOnly made the rich richer as only benefitted corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check their areas because I wanted them to be forced to spend it rather than being you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or they you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and the have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good that you\nKnow hello there George and not Harry of that question for you mentioned earlier about the banks and you can't just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems worse farms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally a money center banks thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to procreate money or pull ... they're going to do for the more fluent in towns and those going to be in the end the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nFor telling here okay thank you\nAnd I think you just answered that part of one of my questions but before I ask that\nA director might get even one of my way to count on the line um hiking up on my head and humiliate crumbled and the combat line\nRight yup they play all about timing\nIf all of that time one of my guiding the looming economic I'm here at talk of that you just answered my question like\nAbout the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of off the larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever's scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major clubs but the smaller accounts that it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money in your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable than and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting so those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hid and of course\nWhen when things go bad people gonna hit foreign depositors more Iceland went down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans and business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account\nWith your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't pay they can't\nPledge those reserves and well that's a good thing Harry thank you were at a time here ... website it comes to ... dot com psychiatrists looks at the

conciliatory words from President Trump would likely be very helpful a couple of economic indicators will be out this morning economists think we'll hear the import prices rose two tenths of a percent last month in early October reading from the University of Michigan may show us might pick up and consumer sentiment\nLet me tell you a bit about Dr many ... she has forty years of experience working in the mental health field a medical degree from the University of Manitoba is a diploma in psychiatry from McGill University now throughout his entire life\nHe is had many close brushes with death as well starting in the womb\nYeah use other number of paranormal or a novelist experiences visions breed cognitive dreams auto body experiences encounters with message bury the operations as\nWell welcome to the program Dr many made us on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nThanks for inviting me\nVery interesting that somebody would your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died so many times\nYou know when my book the borders for normal first came out many people asked me if the book was based on stories with my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nA doctor's bound by the Hippocratic Oath that states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he's told by patience and I don't\nSo the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences pot stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and from I own extensive reading research into the paranormal\nIn terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls with that so many ... that that [noise] um you know\nThere's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience\nMhm [noise] but the um term near death experience you know it's going back to talk to women moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right\nNow I think he estimated that something like one in thirty Americans is that they're headed near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people but there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were pronounced clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my clothes brushes with death affected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls that that I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have over my fear of dying and I have found get myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then he and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say it was gradual\nThe first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything that might just kind of ... the ... you know I just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences\nBecause there was no rational way to explain them but then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm Better at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going food because that would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why do they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it that the the um anonymous stem cells don't it it's called an aloe Jeanette transplant mhm with more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nOr this worldwide um donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr the super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ruin jeeze um yeah\nAnd I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you a chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapse and that fight against that they gave me the parents find huh [noise] now that the person who gave me the transplant he live in an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them and I did write to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the man was a member of the U.S navy [noise]\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in Persian Gulf wow so he was\nFlown back into the donors than from Washington DC and a team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of stem cells and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen if you still in touch with them the data that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did say my language\nAnd ... them you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the basis where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and now is required is that she swab ... that's it\nYeah that that she thought to get the DNA that's when his name entered the donor bang and then I'm ... years later by name came up on the computer and at that point he even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor [noise] but then once you know ...\nFound out that he does have perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow the produce more stems house and they gave him these injection for five days and then he had produced themselves so they took a blood sample which contained\nStem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live ... yes we've become friends and I just I'm not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psyche grown has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to the if the ... [noise]\nHowever since I have that experience and the coyote I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and with a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference I mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed that they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased has been in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel we've touched on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common\nIn fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one even if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know atheist and agnostics have these experiences well as religious people\nYou see that every one is psyche again I I tend to believe you can agree with you\nOK but\nUh when you say that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or telepathy or pay cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of decisions hundred voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences\nSo certain types of fake experiences such as ESP until after the or extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... I was just thinking about\nYou right or is that very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psyche grown out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families um\nWhy is on line I use radio dot com [noise]\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute\nInvestors will no doubt be happy to see this week come to an end analyst looking to uncover the reason for the global equity route have different theories\nGoldman Sachs blames worries over economic growth others of cited concerns about interest rates Daniel more U.S to be an ...

normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize as paranormal phenomenon Mandy let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely calm and don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he thought his late sister he mentioned oh they're throwing you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice is dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors\nAnd who's giving them the message\nChats the question right where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've read or we can say it's coming from the spirit world\nYou know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could have been her fear mhm\nYou know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and there were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the dream telepathy studies that they mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy I don't know a lousy dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone have\nHeart attack I did not that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused it right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although\nWe don't really know and how how did we know it's right you know so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages and dreams 'cause I thought so had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pay cognitive genes or just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I got I I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion\n... and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march\n[noise] that fate in fact she dreamt the night before he just tells you that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate ignored pleas also with his favorite told Julius Caesar it'd be where the march which is the fifteenth of march and he he north ... ignored his wife and he was\nKilled so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition stole Manny\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they did the guard things which could be dismissed that superstition\nIs always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was about horse racing and ... one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else and lost\nIn ... in the movie screaming at ground you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that it is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fair I think people are they don't believe that they don't believe in all of a sudden they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth will have another body experience during surgery\nAnd then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up ... to tell the doctors and nurses um what they thought and what they heard while they were out of their bodies is one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his\nDoctors pie and of course the doctor was founded there was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery [noise] I think that he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest\nAnd they took out his dentures and he left his body and ended up serving everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his dentures\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nYou have you back but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I fire you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were wow yeah it works it would work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical are mysterious\nIsrael different words of being used\nTo describe the same event but I think paranormal event can have a spiritual component yeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who was having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] [noise] oh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more out there that we don't just have to live with a teen nine to five eight you know day to day lives that if something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nUp next when we come back with Dr many ... we're going to take phone calls your goals your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many other things\nYou were just talking about here on the coast to coast they find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\nWell what's new today on the free I her radio a radio\nFor decorating the house or just studying the scary mood [laughter]\n... my ... with labor in my life we've\nFootball or soccer jak\nJoe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite stages of\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute we will see a pick up the pace of the earnings reporting\nStores stability on Wall street banks will be in focus as J.

enter panhandle orders governor Rick Scott the devastation caused by hurricane Michael so many families have lost everything\n[noise]\nWell come back to our final hour with Dr many ... we're talking about his work the borders of normal as this icon\nInterest in you do have to decide whether the person is truly experiencing a psychic issue or is this iconic how do you tell the difference man\nWell the thing is if someone has a vision for example or someone's hearing voices they're certain qualities that would distinguish the say came from a psychotic experience for example of someone who is the voice\nI'm a psychotic hallucination tends to be very very frightening it's also very frequent it could be everyday auditory hallucinations could also be other things besides voices\nThat could be the sound of machinery or insect\nThere may be more than one voice to the voices talking to each other about the person that the voices might be an accusatory or threatening whereas I'm psychic hallucinations and to be infrequent\nThey may occur only once or twice in a lifetime and they tend to be a reassuring and calming\nThe other thing is with psychosis you can't just look at when symptoms such as hearing the voice you have to look at the whole person\nBecause psychosis is the major mental disorder which affects the person's ability to function in society whether the person as a student or whether they're going to work\nOr within the family if they if they're not able to function and if they have a lot of other symptoms aside from the hallucinations for example the thought disorder or paranoid id Asian or you know feelings have ...\n... people are talking about them this type of thing so there's more than just one symptom that you need to make a diagnosis of psychosis\nCan you make a misdiagnosis ... conceivable\nYes in fact it has happened there is a psychologist that did it an experiment where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had to each one of them go to a different emergency room and had different hospitals around the country and it tells the doctor in the emergency room that they were hearing voices\nAnd in each case the patients\nWhile they were patients they were actors pretending to be patient that they were misdiagnosed as it gets ... they're admitted to the word they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the word the the patients me that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they weren't able to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how do they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal aside from the fact that they said they were hearing voices in terms of their appearance their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal so that's why I say you can make the diagnosis on the basis of a single symptom\nHow come the doctors couldn't figure that out\nWell unfortunately you know sometimes doctors make mistakes\nWell that's true [laughter] but but the patients that\nI think because well the patients live with it they they know the illness so well\nThey know the symptoms and everything that's right\nAll right let's take some calls him for your duty in the Ozarks in Missouri have Judy go ahead\nThank you so much for taking my call waiting and waiting to talk to someone who knows a little bit about the brain are a lot about brain I have been a mistake and that had visions all my life and I have that many many near death experiences where I have like my body\nBut I think one of the most interesting things that ever happened to me is when I went to London as an adult and I saw a picture of the war room where they do all the major planning for their European front\nMhm well that's where I used to go and out of body experience when I was little\nAnd there were a whole bunch of us up up above kind of sitting like in the balcony and we were all in spirit that not to go and they were very upset because I was so young and they didn't think I should be\n[laughter] what'd you do them as a remote viewing huh\nNo I Would I have a body travel [noise] and when I saw the picture of the war room I realize that's where I had been as a child\nAbuse still been able to duplicate that\nWell not lately I usually go where there is a really intense suffering like when the Israeli people and we were hiding under the along with sewage canal yeah what was that the fifty seven more\nNineteen sixty seven\nSixty seven yeah um I I go to places that are are really really\nBad why I don't know whether I'm there to help balance\nWhat are you where do you think of as many well I'm curious to know do you have these experiences when you're sleeping or when you're away\nWhen I was little they were when I was sleeping [laughter]\nOr the other ones where I've been out of body I'm just waking up okay between sleep in and awake but it's the most interesting experience I think I've ever had is what I was looking searching for meaning because I was very depressed\nBecause I'm In physical form and there is no we're on\nThe love that you feel when you were in that particular place of knowing what all the incumbency love is\nAnd when I was during meditation always taken and I could see if you knew what glitter looks like in a in a like a a helmet for a motorcycle helmet yes how different angles well this was alive light and the whole screen\nOf my vision was filled with his glittering beautiful different colors of orange and yellow\nAnd I could hear the voice saying this is love and I was\n... totally engulfed in it and it was just a beautiful experience but I found listening to people talk about near death experiences mine near death experiences aren't when ... I'm Out of my body and I'm seeing what's going on and I\nThe last time it happened I was in surgery\nAnd as I came back into my body I can hear the the anesthesiologist saying we're losing her and I thought\nA regional thing I'm back here yeah all\nRight [laughter] you know that type of stuff and that's the reason I I called with the question about what is the difference between schizophrenia and having these types of vision is because I had been up\nAll right well that's that's kind of a fine line isn't it many\nWell yes and no like I said with had study where these patients were misdiagnosed because they reported hearing voices but otherwise they were fine so the question is whether the person can carry on with their daily life or whether they're able to\nFunction or whether is an illness that's interfering with their life so it you can make a diagnosis just on the basis of the fact that person is hearing voices are having other body experiences that would lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia\nBecause someone with a diagnosis schizophrenia has to have a thought disorder as well they have to have problems with their thinking and with their emotions\nAnd you know with their parents with their behavior it's all encompassing so the types of description the description of the types of experiences you you've had doesn't sound like schizophrenia to me\nWhat about hallucinations compared to actual psychic things what's the person they're\nWell\nThere again like police nations can be found in a lot of different medical conditions not just schizophrenia and they can also be ... nations and also be found in people who are mentally and physically healthy\nSo you know I guess ... each person has to be assessed you know in terms of you know what their symptoms are and and you know how how much they're affecting the person's ability to function [noise]\nBut I was just going to say about your caller I was thinking maybe one of the reasons she goes to places when she's out of her body she goes to places of\nPain that are dark and places that are dark\nQuarterly results from J.

there are fewer space and time\nUh right now it doesn't seem to a law information flow backward in time so I thought I Would make myself an experimental subject and I tried for a year or two a record my dream and at first I tried a member of the seven days the portable tape recorders\nAre kind of clunky mhm and uh and to record you'd have to hit two buttons I think like recording play at the same time right right\nYeah so it turns out that was a nightmare like getting up at three in the morning and trying to hit the button so I went back to just writing things down on paper and of course then the problem is uh getting yourself up out of a drain I figured that method for that that took me some of them were reliable\nAnd one night I had a very unusual dream or is it doesn't seem unusual ally ... and then I decided but what happened later in the ... thing and my wife is a is a I was in the situation where I'm sitting with two other people and worth an outside it's some kind of a table\nAnd we're enjoying ourselves having like lunch or something and the one person in the mail and I feel very very close to him I'm comfortable with him and then\nThere's a woman and I don't know her and uh at one point the the nail says uh and we're outside I'm kind of a format outside I thought you know couldn't figure out a ... but anyway he says the uh area I have to go to the bathroom\nYou know where it is and I said no you know until we were had been drinking a cup of Vermont I thought I Do too and so uh yeah let's go look for it and and the dream rafter walk up a rock side but some kind of structure outside of a couple of steps\nAnd then there's another walkway going both ways more cables and then I Would have a couple of them just like many level and finally I said oh look a there the bathroom got married\nAnd so I'm walking ahead of them and the and the dream and I get to the door and I pushed the bathroom door open and there and I'm trying to not be grossed about this but there I see something unusual\nAnd the wind was is in men's room to have toilets of course we're you know the doors closing and you're in ... and then they have\nYou're All right someone had an air at all gun
