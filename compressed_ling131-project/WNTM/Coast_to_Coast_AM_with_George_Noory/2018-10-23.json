O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carpet and cast says we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines instead we just released into the atmosphere\nAnd we were producing them at the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm bars by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh [noise]\nAnd if you warmed Mars that much [noise]\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the up the soil because it's been sponge to and it would out gas and ... with thick in the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this is much ... fresh water in those glaciers is there is a north of\nMel oceans fall I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um but yes\nThe waters on Mars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis\nOr it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be breed the bull\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent efficient five percent efficient and in which case this thing could happen much much faster\nAnd um so I think Mars is going to be tariffs formed within two hundred years\nAnd my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do with the Robert what country but\nThe Martians\nOr they're going to do with themselves no when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they want you to the Iowa so then they bring us back\nRumble set of tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort but I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well ah here's the thing I'm the revolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people I'm a I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia are going to both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of a of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they\nMoved away from command economy um but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a a a private space launch companies but allowing space lunch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and ah because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean\nYou know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise]\nAnd uh the the uh and so if if if they are going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive fence to think um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next

with us we'll get to calls in the seconds Robert we're talking about the other countries that are out there blind to do things in space\nOr how far advanced is China right now\n[noise] well [noise] I'd say China right now I'm is about where the U.S was around Nineteen sixty seven um I mean in terms of manned space flight or you know they've been to earth orbit they've I mean there are a bit\nBeyond the enemy and they haven't gone to the moon of course on the other hand they did launch a small space station which we did not have them\nAnd do they have the rockets and the capability to do that\n[noise] to go to the moon mhm um\nThey can have it pretty soon a I mean but the thing is this okay it's once again um\nThere's a new paradigm now and then these entrepreneurial space companies which have shown they can do things\nThat a state run space companies can't too and they can do the things that those companies can do in one there at the time at one tenth the cost\nAnd if uh other countries took on it uh keep up with the United states right now they're going to have to have their own space access national space programs are not going to be able to match them\nAnd um and that means that for example Russia is going to have to come to terms with\nUnderstanding that they're going to need to have a rule of law there that they cannot have a government that simply steals whole industries for people because I'm no one's going to make it if someone else can take it\nAnd I'm so potent once Russia to remain a ... I'm a strong in space which by the way is a a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nBut it's right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's gonna have to change and it's interesting I mean\nYou know a a a reason is still coming in a certain I mean the reason why the um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well\nThey're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world and other ways\nAnd um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm a I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us where you hire them to do that well yeah well the ... states that one\nWeapons okay I mean because what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well a ... ... ... presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that I mean it's a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm\nIncreasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working ... to go\nAnd um you know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds uh they launch vehicles can

I'm enjoying the show the light of it and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm winning William fleet yet there if we find someone intelligent life do we really have the right to invade like the American deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOkay though there uh-huh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead I'm okay All right well here's the thing um\n[noise]\nThere there isn't intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because he had these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this\nAnd and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we did destroy some things that were\nWorthwhile we created much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks\nUm nobody picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen you know how far out in the future ten years

very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um\nFuturistic at this point uh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nUh being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because a mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now\nOr it has some value and uh and and and the exchange for those claims to people could get a exploration missions finance\nMine the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute

clinical counseling from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on\nEMS environmental sensitivity and grossly donors Brandon has been fascinated by the paranormal four years in Syria's with his work all the dos studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nMy gun shot in a clinical therapist get involved in those studies\n[laughter] um well actually I was interested in a ghost in Paris psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist ah yeah so I actually I actually got a day job and then I study the Paris psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do by the way it's not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when apple was here in at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to digest ourselves into the Gulf studies for what he was an overview of what you've been doing brand\n[noise] well um you know I uh\nI have a degree in Perry psychology or when I was at the University of Edinburgh I've studied or I'm basically it the environmental sensitivity and goats encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the political part a thing\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in and writing a book and that's when I came out with the goes studies\nAnd you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's um no mystery that scientists ... dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes by encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as elusive nation interpretations are overactive imagination which you know it's not really true in my eyes so individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality\nTelevision shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just ghost stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life goes the encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights and the cause of these throwing encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief or even experience and you know ... you know these goats I been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd if and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspective on these things and that's what the book really goes over\nYou know there are several first hand account of ghostly encounters um you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts going to anyone he would talk to me about goes yeah an awful conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's what I came up with some of these maybe theories\nAre and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research to clinical interviews I witnessed the cows and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and five and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghostly encounters with a book well\nThen you bring a dose of real science to the picture your brand and then I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out there you\nJust got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even to some degree you know I'm narrow psychology of fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and I'm entanglement and non locality and\nHow electricity affects us and I'm a ... and what it does outside the body so there is a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find in a hurry to research article it kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWouldn't have you concluded today Brandon about what the ... experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think a majority of it goes they encountered that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening I'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly counters it's such a complex process and there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nStuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on um but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine\nAnd um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them one of the hell\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them or a ... view on goes\nSo that I'm In size basically um telepathy extra sensory perception those types of things\nI I really think that a lot it goes like counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um ... the or I'm sort of 'em are coming in being\nReal sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on my main theories in the book over\nUm what I call a a tele Patrick distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters a so I really think that um people's ... the ... is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way encounter\nHow important than is the person as opposed to the vet for something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing I Know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to goes land counters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ... counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death\nOr life threatening events\nOr some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst that he goes the encounters a so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the advantage when you have this trauma I think it it it sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happen after that and one of those things is a you know a motion\nAll distress so you have an event you have an emotional distress from a life threatening or going to have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these bio energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens\nI think that it actually triggers sort of our innate ability to send a distress signal to somebody else and and the great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these this is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an operation of\nMy aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you know my aunt\nPassed away right on time that I had that\nAnd I and I and I think that that\nYou can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with that my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a Taliban ethic distressing they'll saying to me and I picked up on it and they showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um what environmental sensitivity\nAs it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's where the environmental sensitivity is I'm so those who are are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\n\n\nOne almost

enter into our universe I'm so in this example the witness in a sense was able to access the previous timer dimension universe\nAnd she was able to look back and see what's happening in that location and maybe the child and the mom saw this woman dressed in the future of the ... futuristic clothing and got terrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else\nAnd a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these ah these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even skier due to death\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm a I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio\nAnd um [noise] oh one morning I'm Me and my wife was out of town and I'm\nOne morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenalin and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon and I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratching they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah\nWell you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it you know and I'm like you know and I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I open the door of the dog went outside and the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and and somehow um you know drowned in there by\nYou know like dove into the ... you know all that stuff [laughter] but I asked them to myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but\nSomething drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing and I never got that feeling of that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there some sort of like distress signals sent to me with the cat and distressing they've kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many paranormal experiences occur Brandon because the person who died who comes back never had someone soon as\nBusiness and had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI\nYou know I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there goes my encounters have\nTo do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the death of a father or something right\nYou know I'm ... you know you're sort of struggling with death ah there's all these emotions happening um so\nYou know the body sort of\n... the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ... this\nPsychological wound through what other whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional me you know and if if collective unconscious or collective consciousness exist and memories of personalities and experiences of all of our humans are store to store it in the atmosphere\nUm you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like your father showing up and saying don't be fat I'm at a better place\nYou know and and I think these things [noise] I the research out there really says that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their debts spouse one month after their death um so it's a\nPretty high number eighty percent of the huge yeah yeah\nYeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the deceive shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual psyche and perhaps ... could be sort of a way a process\nEmotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know a final goodbye from the disease I couldn't help but to move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards resolution and ... ... and when I talk to the these people that have these encounters they often report feeling more eve\nOr accepting of a loved one death after the evaporation and I think on TV usually go negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um it can come out of it goes by and counter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to it's just not a negative and demons and things like that\nBrand and what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these kinds of preparations and encounters the mothers what's so special about though\n[noise] that is a that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise] you know something narrow biologically is different about them\nYou know when they put 'em there's there's some cats out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nI Would like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing that this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome some really unique experimental design that um you know where they're actually doing that from our FM our eyes any jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain it actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels so there's some\nSort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can you know so and this is true for with and we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout all rise as well

Missoula with us we'll get your calls as well as we talk about his work the scientific work the ghost studies [noise] what are your colleagues say about your work Brendan if anything\n[noise] um [noise] you know most people actually when they find out that you wrote a book about goes are interested in the inside most people will tell me a story\n[laughter] and they've all got one don't think they do and I was really shocked you know 'cause you're kind of sit back and got away when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive you know there's\nThere's still some college you'll come up to me and go you know I don't tell me a story but then they follow it up with you can't do any water or anything like that but the response has been pretty positive\nI'm you know something that's really fascinating and it I mean it's a mystery it's been an intriguing for human you know the dawn of time you know it's\nTrue so you know it's not that or out of context of anything and listen I mean the college is a subset of psychology it's a legitimate one\nJust like social psychology and neuro psychology it's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh or I studied as a top twenty five university\nThey are the ones to clone sheep and the nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is for those of us in the field it's you know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lot of people\nWhat's out there that has baffled you show for brand in that you don't have the answers you wish you did\n[noise] ah well I'll be honest with you I think ah any type of um hold your guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho ... says we're objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on in those types of cases\nYou know do humans have the ability to move objects if they're\nUm in distress um you know to me it's hard to fathom you have the ability of like where the poultry guys I'm a you know we'll call it goes moving objects when they can't physically touch them and things like that I really don't know the answers to that\nUm so you know it it's it's something I always read about and I go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nWhy new rules seemed to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMr Bush or something else to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep and I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right\nWithout warning soft glowing light appeared next to my bad light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he did not say anything and appear to be just staring at me what was bizarre was that I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious\nThe next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child stating my accent died the night before unexpectedly\nHis death occurred around the same time I saw the image in my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time\nSo this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about\nEarlier so we've all heard of these but it it illustrates the role of a lot but the or a sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing intense emotional chefs related to the process of dying in a in a way sent a\nHell of Patrick distress message to his ... ex wife who we felt linked with in this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glow in the white operation or those types of things um and what's really fascinating is\nSince his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or pull up to the er ... phenomenon my suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of a in a life threatening situation\nThey send something out into the environment like a message ... if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the life\nMay know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well but this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but it also bags that question you know was this\nDid this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do this well\nOh yeah yeah I mean it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and I'm a ghostly encounters electricity and it seems to be\nYou know the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're we all think the electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields\nComes from humans as well an animal sure does show you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because like your city is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nFrom people who walked by street lights and the lights go wild as they get on a on a range the lights go back on\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only Constand an all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience that operation a poetry guy so I knew eerie feeling the temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic field they're always present as well since since the first ghostly encounter ever\nUm you know ... and that's an important thing to think about you know we're always immersed in electromagnetic fails we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is\nYou know and the Mets have always been linked you know there is some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating am apps can actually cause a ghostly encounters um you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a ghost encounter on the other side of that\nThere was this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and goes the encounters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses a EMS meter\nAnd that's an important part of the for them indicating that it goes to this president you know if a if EMS as moving haphazardly through the house like a person walking the belief is obviously that that's it goes\nUh whereas if you have a fluctuating EMS next to a dishwasher you can probably say well that's a dishwasher\n[laughter] um so you know energy electricity electromagnetic fields\nVery ... very entangled with goes way encounters even when I hear these real life goes to encounter some people will say you know uh I just felt like you know my hair was standing up or I felt the room felt Energizer like there was it felt like a\nOf electricity in the air or you know I reached towards the operation in my hand felt like it was shot you know those types of things are always comment as well\nGo to Jason in St Louis Missouri to get things started hey Jay's going in the\nMorning George yeah Brian question or do you believe that we're [laughter] hide you in walls and listen and watch what we're seeing in and do we\nDo they hide in wall Purina sprinted\nNo I I don't think so you you know and and then this is obviously just my opinion um there's no way to definitely prove this but but I don't see it goes that sort of I'm\nHanging around all day watching us\nYou know like a TV um I see the ghostly encounters and paranormal experiences happening at certain times in certain events for certain reasons like the the Halloween thing we talked about before\nThere's some sort of need for that interaction and and sometimes when people have interaction where there isn't a need it's more people sort of like we talked about linking up to the environment and having an experience with some guy you know there's that intelligent haunting that's sort of like the cream of the crop\nYou know those types of things are harder to explain in in sometimes that falls into an earth bounce spirit but I don't I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us in the way\nUm you know just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for the goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them you know it it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that\nThere's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environment of the resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe don't teach in Rochester

suggesting people have a bitcoin ... gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we give investors the option don't both in their IRA now explain that force\nWhen I first heard about bit pointed treated for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how one guy bought two pieces with ten thousand bitcoins that were worth about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars\nAnd what stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWhile I Know it's quite a pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is good coined or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people on on it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nWe do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be

seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com that's one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com\nAnd I think that's really a one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling
