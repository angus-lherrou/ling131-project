I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveils a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found is true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great have you back\nGeorge I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nWhen you say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today\nThat you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books I insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities with some of the missing to your own life right\n[noise] you know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and [noise] there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put the in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these are the Drake who is fighting these are the upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the\nHigh rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one\nIt seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder has the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and uh\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and it's frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement report\nThe who they interviewed who they talked to were they searched the effectiveness of the search or the areas that they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you really searching blind\nAnd there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything I I find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing that the families of the missing but uh it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction\nSo when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found this appearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative back right on to be looking into it [noise]\nAnd a sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act of course it gets to national park service they have the largest contingent a federal we train police officers and the national park police [noise]\nIt kind of a survey by Bloomberg

imitators out there are people who have written books similar to yours as well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that very moment before we jump into the cases\nSo this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that\nAnd I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the named David polite is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is a candidate missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click in and you listen if you don't know it's somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us the people don't trust YouTube really don't even listen to him a less effect cannot missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that using ruin on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I a huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports\nNow find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased they're released the report most times times they won't there's a case from eighty six\nAnd are found impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often found impossible distances away and there is no way no way they can walk there on their own or talk about that phenomenon\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talked about these cases and a couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with the case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOn four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps ah another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book\nBut I mean there is a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data because in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen what these numbers absolutely blow that to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance and extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you're you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away we'll watch the child what's that child's gonna do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and you think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare but I have all these examples where these heights have been achieved by these little kids\nWere they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nWell yeah you got a movie and we talked about a two year old boy that they\nJust he traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges and he was found face down in snow the next morning unbelievably alive and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened in his his mom said we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe he was alive\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was from back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours he didn't have to go point six miles per hour\nA buddy kid's not going to war for twenty four hours with no food or water\nUm it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody pick them up for some some thing or someone picked him up and blocked him there\nAs well and and the reason these cases have significant is that what's\nYou report on a child who's abducted in downtown\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know ... somebody put 'em in the car and drove down there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party and anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody saw anything nobody Sony cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make the difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book uh it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you got some new ones including one that happened in the organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona\nReady to take a break now when we come back this one has really creepy and even some of the investigators who are working the case admitted it was really creepy I Will tell you why in just a moment talking with David polite is going to take a break the Ellen persons project break down into the break [noise]\nCoast website is no streamlined devices Greek news if you're a coast insider simply want to enjoy our website on your phone visit coast to coast am dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nThe biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their CWC\nI already all music\nDon't miss the iconic performances\n[noise]\nThis is a Bloomberg bark admitted the new month begins and data from the nation supply managers will provide an early look back at factory activity in the ... that just ended\nIt kind of a survey by Bloomberg said the manufacturing index makeup slipped in September the ... will still point to growth in the sector the government will release a report on August construction spending the fourth quarter also begins today Ryan ... financial told Bloomberg Radio it could be a good quarter for Wall Street\nDo not forget the fourth quarter to image from years actually one of the strongest fourth quarter in the first quarter in second quarter of next year the pre election year those are three of the strongest corners of the four year cycle\nAs for concerns about the Republicans losing control of the house Dietrich so stocks have historically done well with a split Congress when there's a Republican in the White House\nThe presidents of the Federal Reserve bank of Atlanta Minneapolis and Boston will be speaking in their districts today quarterly results from Cal main food will likely get scant attention Jeff ...

reports amazed added a we don't have any I said have you heard of the case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all of the articles and all the reports said that they stay that she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and then you as university lab tech to earn some extra money\nShe loved the outdoors type regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation\nThe end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and want smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he she he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nWhile in February third she moved to your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site\nWith a note taped inside the windshield\nAnd it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly you know I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind that something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second\nHe notified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service that you sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described in reports is cold and blustery they determined care was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources\nThey also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent a guy named Matt Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents they did the care would never ever go off trail she was an outlet outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second Matt Ryan told the Associated Press\nIt's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery march seventh one last push to locate curl rangers claimed to\nSmell an older of the human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service put the teen into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd\nAgain they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils\nAnd it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for radio what it says one additional clue was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the ...

E. airship and this was originally taken by our military [noise]\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] what both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to a treasure island for the day to leave on their ship [noise]\nUh that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal for person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nFirst hundred and ten minutes to the flight was normal in fact there was no communication and then it seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating a suspicious oil slick and there were five miles to the fair on islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scrambled to ... to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the blip\nOn the planes encountered cloudy weather with a feeling of five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field received a call from Fort fund the near the Golden Gate stating that they are to LA ship with two pilots and all we're fine\nWell the navy made a huge sigh of relief and they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in a file and they couldn't explain why it was there [noise]\nAnd then it eleven Fifteen for fun and cause Moffett Field again they didn't get that in LA had crashed in the hills of Daly city Daly city is just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb missing the gone to was in near perfect condition both motors on the ship or off even though one trial was half open and the other was all the way open\nAnd the crew which was required were life preserver over the water bowl of the white preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone there was a confidential maybe briefcase in each a airship and that was still intact the cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tanks\nThe radio with in perfect condition no distress call\nFor fun and called back and say they they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nCentral coast of California had a major search started almost immediately the navy found to fishing boats and navy boat in a postcard shipped to solve the blimp dip and dropped to wears on the oil slick\nThe blimp then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowd is it all pure fairly normal but it did go into the crowds and disappeared\nThe crash happened at four thirty to build you stream Daly city three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crews did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there [noise]\nThere was a couple of theories that I'm Sorry I interrupted there's a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break and when we come back we're going to jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nInto the break with the journey wheel in the sky\nTo find them more of us and I just logged on to go to ... am done\nIt's Monday October first voice news today on the free I her radio ...\nShow sorry you're weak with all the best player ... gas stations all in one at least a locked up these late last year by Sandy I reveal resumes Egypt so vital experience\n\nThis is a Bloomberg market meant it investors will hear a lot of said speak this week each day will bring at least one appearance by a central banker the presidents of the Federal Reserve bank of Minneapolis Boston ended lend it will be speaking in their districts today\nYou kind of a survey by Bloomberg said the supply managers manufacturing index that comes up right after the market's open this morning they showed that factory growth slowed slightly in September the government will report on August construction spending Ryan ... upbeat about stocks heading into the fourth quarter it could\nBe any reason for a normal so often the tricky September October months but overall November and December usually a stronger we'd be looking for another bite at that mentality or that's what he's hearing the fourth quarter\nDietrich tells Bloomberg Radio stocks traditionally do well in the fourth quarter of mid term election two years tell me foods is the only company scheduled to post quarterly results today pepsico ... go and pure one imports opened their books later in the week ...

agreement us NCAA replaces the Nineteen Ninety four NAFTA packed\nDownload IRS radio\nAnd get use radio seven ten WN GM on the go\n[laughter]\n\n[noise]\nBefore the break we are talking about this US Navy blimp it's patrolling off the coast to California and uh the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\n[noise] for the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board\nWhen it hit the beach originally when it hit land it dropped one of its bombs accidentally that made the blimp lighter was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they reviewed radio bugs there was no call for help\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the clouds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch the ... that they were watching on the water there were lots of water craft in that area\nThey never found the crew or the emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd there's an area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which has had several strange disappearances I've documented\nAnd just south of the Golden Gate to a location called the half moon bay in that area of the coast I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no other part of the northern California coast north of\nThat coin raise area\nAnd nothing immediately south half moon bay\nSo it's this one area that have the strangeness attached to it and like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that we are laughable\n\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened ...\n... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left or the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be have been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak\nRight because the the area of the water that was searched up there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I noticed that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works uh in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick Marilyn ditch case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was the organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened in the winter basin\nAt the circumstances were it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them uh their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I've thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman books it looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these are odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of the stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by\nThe Pentagon or to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch in elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which\nHad been read in Washington it turns out earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot\nCannot make public but they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulls me aside\nHe had a had an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomenon at the ranch\nAnd I asked a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone uh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the public has never seen so you know he he has a\nVery broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so I don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think it's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call [noise] I think so um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area to see if there was anything related to a disappearance so I could sing my teeth into that could relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say just related to missing people that I study but ethics seated before sometimes I think\nI I relate it to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers aren't ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it and I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water\nAnd when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it just filled with water I have no cases from there\nIt's bizarre\nIsn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow um it's a manmade lake but the what's right in the middle\nYou'd reservation ... ah control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at the lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and objects coming in and out of the water in a lot of drowning said that they the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and uh\nSo ... you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things and that's or but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right\nNow anyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had brought them your books and and your subject matter\nI Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\nSure I'd separate

you go I'm going I'm going to tell you a story of an actual experience but first I wanted to say\nI think that there's that the higher echelons are working with the parks that won't give you information they don't want you to know and my second point before I tell you my experiences\nI'm encouraging you to read about\nThe the Buddhist or teaching about these different types of creatures that live in proximity different dimensions but they can interact even thousands of years ago they talked about abductions but the ... to\nTalk about what they look like what the realms were like what they did anyway so I just encourage you to do that but here's the story this is true\nIt it was before nine gene Ninety six I used to live in Rochester\nBut I was living in California I drove across the country many times I went to visit some friends of Rochester ah I'll Try and find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm going to send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a man or woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around out ... similar to me out of nowhere\nAnd picnic tables right near there and the one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared said Hi to the other one and she had a girl and the shuttle can our kids play and the the\nThe people that I have been working with the mother said yeah and we shut down at a picnic table and the strain for him and said to the other lady that I had to walk with what's your name\nThe they tell their name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks into boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I swear to God I Am not making this up\nThere was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bump them but this is the part I Want you know it had\nKinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looks humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped\nAt least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought that the creature and those people that are pure were part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was a genetic hybrid this is what I Believe [noise]\nWell that's quite a story or Dave any reaction to

David and I'm not sure I don't remember an example here you you reference it about an earlier book in this new book um about the boulders\nAnd I was always wondering well heck there's boulders all over the place how can that relate to the missing persons a mystery\nYou have a couple of cases where witnesses tell you why it it relates that these things sort of come alive um or they move right\n[noise] well yeah I wrote a story my last book one right before the [noise] about a story a Spanish priest in Texas that was running from Native Americans and came up on this giant piece of cake granted in Texas it's a state park [noise]\nAnd he said that after he ran up to the top of the granite it opened up and swallow with him\nAnd he said that he was inside the Boulder gift admitted for three days\nAnd then he said at the end of the third day it's that amount and that is the only story I got like that and uh people probably don't know this but there's stories of Iceland\nThat they will move road when they're building it before they will blow up granted or big Boulder because they have a bully in their society that things are living inside of those ...\nThey've a ... a

I'm a I'm area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff very long time or the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena in Utah\nSpent some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe\nAnd had reported the number of different kinds of creatures and it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least in the last fifty or so years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing uh but no I hadn't heard the story about the\nThe two girls there's no way they lifted any weight and even to adult men that looked like lumberjacks again they look just like the people on the brownie paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting\nAreas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes wide again just like of aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans it was like they were too perfect\nNot a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the\nCloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere\nSo they just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\nThey kind of stopped and chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped and I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two or three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake\nAnd like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life sometimes don't sink in until after the fact [noise] and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute\nHow did they even get that ATV onto the road that show [laughter] alone how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nKnow I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that their records their their sounds\nIt was in those sim woods where I heard this ah ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and I don't think of the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound\nAnd I'd encourage you to find out what coast to coast did with the audio tape they used to play of this a legit big foot recording\nTen or more years ago George ... used to play it I think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years but I heard that up in the shame woods\nIt's a unique recording never heard of it before I'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big\nWhich might be dimensional\nMight extraterrestrial connection the humanoid that I saw in the woods but more I think about it there's\nNinety nine point nine percent sure those remarks

far away and uh you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I kept hanging out look at the stars and about in the past and they closed or at least three to five miles in maybe ten minutes and it

Wednesday ... going to be back on the air\nAnd I always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveils a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found this true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great have you back\nGeorge I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to me though I appreciate the invite\nI Want to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today\nThat you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books are insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities some of the missing to your own life right\n[noise] you know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family are people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and [noise] there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of time and uh [noise]\nI've put the in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know hey if people are really really good people these are the Drake who is fighting these are\nThe upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one\nBecause it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder has the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nThat have happened and uh [noise]\nI don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise] and there's been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been glad to help and ah\nI've kind of guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop\nWell many time families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports law enforcement report\nThe who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search or the areas that they completely eliminated and the and the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind and there's been in for just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI I find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was ... and ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard you\nEarlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction\nSo when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found disappearances in their parks were they had worked that bothered them didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal lead train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done\nThat's up from the current sixty two and a half percent\nAnd the U.S getting expanded access to candidates protected dairy
