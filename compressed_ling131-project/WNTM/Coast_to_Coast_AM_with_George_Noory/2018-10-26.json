realm our human senses only perceive a small slice of what exists in the infinite world\nSo I don't view that I'm a good judge of what exists outside of what I can see with my eyes or ears you know the the basic human senses and so I generally try to start with that and I asked someone well how do you know you were seeing everything that is how do you know that\nWould question the question\nAnd often that stop someone because one can take a book with a pattern on it and move it in such a way in front of your eyes that it goes through a blind spot and then you're I technically can't see it

comfort and accepting\nThe flow if you will that has come my way and my hope is my sense is that this flow has a higher meaning that I don't have all the details for but if I go with it rather than fight it it makes my day is a lot easier\nWhat message would you have for somebody drawn who's going through the same thing you went through\nThe message I Would say would be when it gets really really dark that's where you find something that's really really light\nAnd it sounds like you have devoted your life now to this mission of getting the word out about what happened to ... the dangers of some of these medicines and of course what's on the other side don't stop right\nI I don't intend to I Am I Am definitely devoted to communicating what happened to him but at a higher humanistic

twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge\nObject ten to twenty times\nThe mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud preventive brown simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our\nSolar system for decades and it was\nTwenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called error out in the ... rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that put our shipping downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to adore planted in the ... belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote\nIt is like chasing a go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field\nPushes half a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it

professor brown says that it is quote till like chasing a go\nAfter more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet to be only seven times more massive than

planning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll\nFinally be able to visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than that distance from the earth to the sun though that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than ... June ... good way out there but they had ... narrow down the focus so\nHe deliberately going\nOn November first started another surge because the new calculations predict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nNow from the California Institute of technology planetary science department in Pasadena, California drawn I mean professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November the date when you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just at visible wavelengths just like your eye because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would say just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet now and looking at it in the end for a study of will be very important but not probably the best way to look for\nYou isn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun then we'd be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even ...\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it will be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized it'd be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between things that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets\nSometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might have come from why is this massive object all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or anywhere inside of our solar system where Neptune and your interests are but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but in till we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this is just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like your it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border of\nYou use them in ten WINZ news radio dot com\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute we're nearing the end the weather's been another

more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what her computer models showing to those you've you worked on the eye BCC report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those stuffed with\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact\nIt seems that some of the larger nations the United states included my adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nUnfortunately you put your finger on it\nMy guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office and so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with\nThat short a period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and how the news and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned votes on the east coast right on the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where there are likely to be enormous numbers affected by two level rise really forced to migrate as their cities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you go\nEarly in the such migrants at one point five degrees\nBut you said many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from Lola choose\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and ... all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to a lot of the crises\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from coast\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts and again there's kind of a head and the same mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist\nBut this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as we show it was for years ago\nSo global climate change and increasing more definitely bring more wars\nYes go\n... well it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control\nAnd one of the big headline the summer of twenty eighth team a Malian Florida

all over the time and everybody who live there now and that political governments and mirrors saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets at Miami is nonsense\nThat

the map of what is expected to happen to Florida\nOver the Next Fifty years and now that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster if Florida had water flooding\nLet's say three

well just a three weeks ago and October third I was doing update on three categories\nThe first had to do with\nThe very distressing subject of half cats be headed cats around the world bloodless weird\nAnd Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a

on the sensitive\nWhite sands missile range in Holland an air force base uh the down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update had evolved from my asking my earth files YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately\nAnd I had received a huge number of emails and a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was talking about when the next\nMorning on October fourth floor a Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down\nIt was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video analyst I worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show and he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at\nA my earth files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see the loop videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was that he thinks this is truly anonymous and uh then I asked\nA that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office and believe it or not\nA second I'm One of these whatever they are\nCame between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me emails about their own experiences with the smoky\nFog is it like ... than\nI Do not know this is extremely a translucent and uh\nWhen I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never\nMentioned any of this parrot to loved ones to children to parent none they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent and his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard and he uh let me say he said you can\nUse my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida\nBut what you're going to hear\nTook place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked\nBy two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now\nIs Charles hazard uh talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida home\nMissed was in the spring of two thousand in age\nAnd I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn during the campaign area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down a very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside and leave on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with new stars that I can see and then suddenly I just\nI was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly open them again\nAnd through the window I can see this misty grey I'm drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was it in this dark bedroom was luminous\nAnd I can see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming to us\nHe's made it looked like it was coming right for my head and I was just frozen\nThe fascination of I didn't know what to think men as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted hire a glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was feeling of euphoria and one is with this living thing that was surrounding made\nAnd then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time I was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked throughout millennia\nAnd they were all being answered at the same time like all of these answers becoming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously and I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it\nI don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of the ... that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of what kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head tell a possibly\nKnow there were no word there was no sound the hiring glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I can see ... but they had the same texture and the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they would just float by me but kind of mean\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head\nAnd as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a downloaded information that was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was the super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that moment it was for something that was being given to me but I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall this information because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any sub text in your mind\nOr your soul about who would be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it may because in my

two thousand and two silver was four dollars announcing there at the cost of production we predicted silver would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nIn why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nSolar in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silver equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown the hall I guess not but could silver reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nHoop you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think are one hundred dollars is well within reach\n... when that happened over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything that you can send out to listeners so they can find out more about a hundred dollar silver\nWe do George or going to make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar\nAnd why experts the silver rising to a hundred dollars announce the report the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip coal gas in nuclear combined\nLet's get Lee or sky high silver report in some fascinating report and don't miss out on the ... revolution call

seventeenth\nThat was not hear any longer in a visible form than thirty frames of one second\nAnd it's puzzling but um I I have come in in my own intuitive feel\nIs that it it is a or was the spirit of loving cat of mine who passed a year ago um ... that that cat was like a human being to me a furry soul\nAnd uh several people around the world I've probably gotten twenty emails from people who\nMedicaid or are involved with various kinds of um meditation type of forms to access and they have all gotten the impression that\nBoth times that this has been my cat ah the the one that had passed and I feel that intuitively that gives me a comfortable feeling why shouldn't we\nBe educated about the possibility that a soul that passes because a body fails can actually return even if it's
