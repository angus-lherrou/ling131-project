Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two\nAnd so not yet but in oh five years or Iran and spends about seven years and a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional\nThat is a sort of happy go lucky enthusiastic energy it's certainly good for anyone whose uh son science ... in general the next year or so up by the way when you estimate the retrograde\nVenus goes retrograde this Friday I just mentioned that you know which could be the day of the vote up or down and Venus is Scorpio and it's a ... I wanted to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third of any year so those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is\nFocused on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure that\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it\nMight be as well one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there they're they're amazed because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information\nAnd so from the political realm it when people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports and need to do it for work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they're being reported like Lincoln these split hour after hour and I think that you know\nPeople are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking where you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there and so\nKind of like a revolution every single day somewhere and I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me are back in July and you're always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you chat you know charge the rush to the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] [noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one\nAnd you could in general I mean these things are not usually done you can take a look at the whole month of November by looking at the same midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is of a particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nI'll be on the air with everybody\nYeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always a rising and the son is in Capricorn at the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so\nThere you have to ... feet in all the other planets like for instance midnight New Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and\nSaturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional part of the war will go into its own fine actually laid on December thirty one\nAnd then the son of Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars and um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but something with Saturn at the beginning of year is often you know too many frustrations law to block coming in\nBut I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand Nineteen for the world\n... why does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this is what the old idea\nExactly and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nIf everything depends on something being born in a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the ... that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that it's free they taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually used for the America's Choice because it was our first breath were were saying it gets wet England were independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning\nNow not every astrologer works with that chart but most of them do [noise]\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon the various planet it's not that they're making things happen from outer space\nIt's that whatever is born a person\nA president take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time\nUh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what is that saying about the potential of my work at this job being the president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website or new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got an linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month day in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate you are you\nWell look I could if somebody said to me I Know and unborn ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually months ten year I could do anything for that person not as exactly ...\nDo it because timing allows us all kinds of things sunrise birth is is it near noon is a ton said is it a midnight we're or the planets falling at that point because in twenty four hours most of the pilots are gonna be in the ... they're going to be in the same science but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go\nHalf of the time and so the moon has a lot to do with our instincts or mood even reincarnation and looking back at who we may have been ordered the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has a lot to do a personality the sun is more of the character and kind of a life force\nAnd a connection and a little bit more just spirituality but so polarizing find which was sunrise in the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nIn uh in telling me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done ever you know in this\nField well unfortunately I well there's two things I'm studying the chart for when President Kennedy died okay 'cause I learned so much about astrology and I was there well I wasn't there I was thirty when it happened twenty two and I got into the other is on the nuclear in an Atomic Energy area\nLet's talk more about that and take phone calls in just a moment right here on the

more Lerner the astrologer with us mark how long would it take someone just study astrology if they wanted to become an astrologer\nWill I okay it took me one year it was kind of like my graduate school where I was twenty two I was studying metaphysics people like Rudolph Steiner\nGeorge grungy of uh spend ski ... the Alice Bailey teachings and so on 'em and I found my mentor Dana and who are who is one of the great astrologers of the twentieth century and he had studied not just the strategy but philosophy psychology and metaphysics of thought\nSo I read all of his books and kind of memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there uh the planet mercury which rules mind thinking communication at the time of his birth and Pisces was exactly at the same spot where mine was and I knew what his chart was and\nWhen I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and off and underrated was on the same spot but any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City\nAnd but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much more than just an astrology charts they ... they have to learn what's called transits and progression where the planets keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince since you've been doing this and what was it that got you interested in it and then something happened\nUm I started going medical uh to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have studied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it\nI was into ah all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of a psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date or the first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home\nAnd just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I mentioned TV for astrology the space age science and it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo ... all of these great physicist and all these people have studied\nA more of astronomy telescopes Galileo and so on they were all astrologers but when the biographers would write about the is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault\nThey were all went to the phony thing of astrology because they biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand you know why why was the greatest scientists before noon and sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nNow how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nWell what they didn't realize is who was the science was taught in the universe is if Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations Persia Egypt Rome great you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's burned the December twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay born at one forty two in the afternoon now\nIn Jersey City now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there I'm not putting on my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of\nGet that information pretty quickly and you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean uh if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this area of my life and then I'll just see what I can tell them and we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob you're\nGood welcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay yeah I it thank you okay great you you're on with mark Lerner of given mark you burn they you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say\nAh of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon\nAnd tourists rising and he's born very close to a first quarter moon I'm a ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour people don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an areas moon\nComing from other lives and like instinctual early\nThis individual had a lot of assertiveness and forceful illness and kind of an aggressive personality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where he he has leadership qualities developed in other allies particularly in the last life\nAnd now with the sun and Capricorn that's kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um\nGrounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual sons so it's an extra kind of a this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he's strengthens his immune system and stays healthy\nThat um he doesn't become pessimistic about things\nUm but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nOr do you have a question to\nUh yeah what what if I'm not help you now [laughter] well if you're not held on now again you want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't get it on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology the power of numbers in neurology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I've studied that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWe're all psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess how it would work out of why we would see like an Einstein are gone D. or different people and mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there's a whole field of esoteric astrology there was a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the ... trains and Edgar Casey\nThere was a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically\nBut spiritually when we're asleep psychic Lee people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kind of thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things indefinitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and our incarnations like in the chart\nWe're looking at the like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan a higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun moon and the planets and the configuration that we have\n... reincarnation astrological you speaking you were the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that well were they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... ... ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing you know people might\nIn the old days I mean a lot of people thought\nPeople would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I have read my life [noise]\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light worker kind of work at this stage in twenty first century\nMike ... will come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from fellow man and a woman being able to come into the world of north suspicious time to take advantage of astrological vibrations\nThey're to me absolutely in other words the sold the spirit comes in and chooses parents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of thing and then you're actually choosing when to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people to talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nExcellent let's go on to Cleveland Donna's with
