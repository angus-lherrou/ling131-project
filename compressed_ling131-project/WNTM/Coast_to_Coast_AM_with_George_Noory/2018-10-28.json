you have to remember to one week before Reagan's first election he was down to Jimmy Carter by ten points you know it was nicer that he would have when\nAnd when he came to office the press you know he was just a meal Don's ... you know right wing not\nEverybody can learn about bedtime for bombs or whatever by my headline everywhere right\nAbsolutely and now you know they make fun of writing and say I can only speak if he was speaking off of three by five car and you know he wasn't smart wasn't well read it was that was absolutely not the truth and I think as Reagan continue to\nWarm and like

frankly the media might say that he's a failure use ... and there's something else but the bottom line is\nThese crowds of a hundred thousand people are signing up to go see him in Texas and elsewhere ... what do you see them doing going forward\nYeah if we use the word repair I don't think that's conceivably possible because I don't think this is something that's necessarily now within his control\nI don't think even if you walk up tomorrow morning and want to you know kissing all the press is not going to happen and and that's because it's interesting it it's not too tough to imagine that Trump has an individual made a decision\nTo go to war with the media but but now that the media has made the decision to go to war with Trump yeah that's a very different thing I don't\nThink the media and I I think they kind of a a you know that kind of ... now and and now they're they're they're in an enemy can't against him no matter what I don't think there's a truth that's on the horizon

got\nA logo air pollution guys run Atkinson and I had a realtor by mark ... and my twelve year old son and we had an appointment with Wilbur nine o'clock in the morning so\nWe got in a car and we drove down the fourth and we went to the port coming from the office of them\nI walked in and now that we were there and they said well Mr turned against him here because what do you mean he was mayor we have an appointment at nine o'clock right and we were by the way with all the time that we were going to promote a port revenue bond that the reason we were working through the port commissioner\nSo they I says well wherever they said well he's out at the north Jedi aware and washed ashore out there so\nWhen we got all the information we thought wow wants to fail we're here let's

or\nA finale or a ... uh I'm trying to think of a play or\nDoesn't matter wherever it was you were doing a show yeah and\nWe're wiring a finale and I was talking to a guy or old explosive guy and uh he told me about a story when ever oh somewhere in Europe blowing\nBridges up and he said uh you know kid when you want to blow something up that my teacher told me you figure out how much dynamite you need and you double it and this guy and remind me of a guy telling me the story\nIs there actually want any way to calculate how much dynamite it would've taken too as they wish to do a ... or turn into little tiny particles I thought I\nI think what they should have done up they were going to use the ... the ... you know with put them may be the case or two and a single stick on top of the well put planned on top of it so it was you were\nKind of blow it and pull apart in place more or less the Philip Barry the peace\nBut at least you'd have smaller pieces to bury\nYeah but and but uh this guy I thought he was gonna by putting the dynamite on the board cited figured he was going to blow the whole thing off the ocean and it didn't work that way um\nWildcard line you're on the air with wall I'm an opera hello hello\nHi yeah er about that well yes the right thing to do is Buddha bought across the way I\nDo watch a deal bar a steel bar yeah I voted across the oil yes\nAnd then die or open drag it out to eat then you blow it up that's what they probably could have done to fatten up I remember that time there was a pretty good fight against foreign and if they had to go you know got a big net or something and put around that and put them behind them identity grub got out a couple of miles and then cut off\nWell see that's why I really the only part of the story that I don't have and I wish I could get and I will pursue is the genesis of it when these guys were sitting around whether it was in an office or in a bar after work whatever you know how they came up with this\nThat would be good to know the minutes of the meeting where they planned it\nSomewhere he got a rule of thumb case a dynamite per ton of whale\nPer ton of well [laughter] I did you spend\nA lotta time arguing with him that this was ...\nWell I I got cut off pretty quick you know or you don't argue with it with a bureaucrat when he's in charge and but I tried\nIn the interview uh he seemed very confident very confident yeah now did you say you must have seen that interview actually going on yeah yeah\nOh you did so uh there there he was young he looked pretty proud and his only attitude after all of this was over respectively was that he had not used enough dynamite\nThat that's I that's why they pulled the guy from Sports Illustrated [laughter]\nOh a west of the Rockies are running out of time you're on the air with wall I'm an opera Hi hello hello art bell yes where are you\nAh I'm ah in reading the northern California All right hey I have thought you might find

were in but they had a sperm whale a wash up in their town that was ... that and the city made an activity out of utilizing every bit of the well as the old way was the ... the bones for practical purposes\nWell I think uh this is just to hazard a guess but walled from what you've told me of the condition of the whale or it's not something you'd carnival up and take home for the dinner table\nIt was pretty rank I don't know how long the thing that's been dead but it was kind of doing you know [laughter]\nCome God ... that's ... ... oh that's what I'm saying well listen I don't know how to thank you ... ... right [laughter] you don't have helped 'em a correct or actually\nVerify what until now has been missed so bless your heart for staying up with this wall and I you know

them\nDidn't know was a forgery\nA forgery yeah man I'm I'm going to ask you to do something because in light of this news I Would say the ...\nTen of the letter and I remember the content of the letter the content of the letter was in my opinion very very suspicious ... well I'll tell you what I said about it at the time that it could've come straight out of the White House press office now\nDo you have a copy of that letter and if you do what you read it to us please\nA\nOr have I caught you by surprise that\nJust a matter of reaching the cross here\nOkay well I figured somewhere you'd have that ah I'm all tell you what I'll tell you know I mean\nLet me read it I have it right\n[noise] maybe I should look at the table of contents\nAnd I'll tell you what does a good place fine I'll take a break it's that important I'll just give you a couple of minutes to find that\nI doubt it you got it yeah go\nI made mistakes from ignorance inexperience nova work\nI did not knowingly violate any law or standard of conduct no one in the White House to my knowledge violated any law or standard of conduct including any action in the travel often there was no intent to benefit any individual with specific group\nThe FBI lied and they report to the Eighteen to practice covering up the illegal benefits they receive from the travel off a GOP has lied and misrepresented its knowledge and its role uncovered a prior investigation\nThe ushers office plotted to have a cough incurred taking advantage of cocky and a chart the public will never believe the innocence of the Clinton and their loyalty staff\nThe wall Street Journal editorial editors live without consequences I was not meant for the job\nOr the spotlight of public life of Washington Here ruining people is considered a sport\n\nAnd that's it that's it [noise]\nThe part that really grabbed me was they are just in a suicide note it I don't think you would say the public would never believe the innocence of the Clintons well\nIt was interesting missed all up and said you know he said any time you have a note that suddenly appears when they need to be such duck and then it seemingly benefit some ...\nIt's just the immediate cause for concern and of course here you have so many disjointed state and federal all the experts believe\nThe statement had been taken from other documents that he had bad maybe had Britain and other contact and had been put together a good word you will always try to imitate known writing\nSo er so they're trying to port well of course of course so you what\nWhy the letter doesn't mention suicide or death because it's been off for apparently didn't right I'm going to kill myself for a good by world\n\nAnd yet that sounded like kind of a summary note nevertheless I mean some are rising everything to this point and it was some something in mind without having said suicide it did sound kind of final summation of this failure or however you want to look at it\nAt the press conference there were a number of reporters a number of TV networks I don't think that ran on any of the television network\nWell there we come to a very interesting question now Reuters ran the story ... been ... to me all day long there's a lot of excitement up about it out of their writers ran the story you say the networks were their\nCBS and NBC\nOh really yeah how could they possibly ignore\nEvidence of this sort I mean I guess CBS could choose to ignore it or protecting its sixty minutes division but what about the other is and what about the Associated Press and ... you know I mean in\nPractice the major news outlets in the country and they didn't send a reporter\nAnd then they got a copy of the report and they said they were going to do a whole new story or at least a dispatch I mean here Reuters did a major dispatch twice the length that they usually do on these type of story\nAnd the a P uh editors for Washington were telling people yeah we're going to do a story and it ends up they do what the classic bury the story or they have it's a coup paragraph literally at the end of a long story on white water hearing but nobody's interested in in Washington\nA panel of experts has declared that the foster noted suicide the government can vote otherwise\nBlah blah blah but\nThis is now then all of three international forensic experts and they are saying apparently now you tell me without qualification it's a forgery how do they come to that and okay\nWell before they even get to the issue of forgery and they're also saying that the FBI and the park police totally mishandled it that nowhere and forensic examination do you ever come here a note like that or any no one document\nTo make it certification which is exactly what a park police and the FBI did\nFor the big question mark is why did they ban the normal procedure and I love my article what you have the FBI crime lab assistant director and the former head of the question document unit at the bureau thank you know you want in a minimum of ten documents\nWell the only they with ... and you know the liberal\nYeah vi crime lab as as we all know is now under close scrutiny there's going to be an international a panel put together to look into the FBI crime lab\nWell who knows that may be a lot of crime going on there\n[laughter] well sticking with the note for a second the declaration than it is a forgery he is a blockbuster I mean if that's a forgery then the whole damn thing comes apart\nWell there's a couple of reasons why first of all there was a great quality for fishing because the note is found in a briefcase the research that the police that that they were suspicious of the fact that that briefcase search by empty\nEnough pound looked at it second it um benefited or people at the White House and took the onus off approving the suicide third ... was born and apparently the experts at any time you have a a document question document that is corn\nMutilated crumple from things build on it\nIt is often times an effort\nTo make it come Paris than\nDifficult difficult sure so already\nYou have a primary ... cases that the English experts at a physician then you look at the no\nAnd the first of all the don't if you look at the no which we have a photocopy of we had a huge blow up a write in comparing you can see that they did not match that the way he the stroke structured are done\nThe flow slant\nThe letters is not the fame\nSo then from make clear handwriting expertise point of view which is a good science it's a forgery\nIt is a forgery and the other thing is what they were able to show in large blow up was that certain letters like when you write a letter let's say to let her be right you might only write that letter lower case B with one stroke start at the top go down at the bottom\nYou round it out and then the last stroke is going over the next letter the end of the stroke\nBut I had born here will not do it that way he'll write the line down they'll stop the stroke it might take the bow of the letter B. and start from the top of bringing around\nAnd you can see this from a large blow up and that's what they were able to show that the letter of beef for example um was done in three stroke structures trope unlike officer who had a very\nTenuous and the style of writing uh-huh which you can all we had a dolphin document that\nAir to three different for a\nVery very clear that we ah that that that it is and back\nYou know uh this is starting to get very dangerous for some people Chris at this point\nLike you like me like anybody who's got anything to do is saying what we're saying right now but\nThis has got to lead it's got to lead to the next step and so you're asking a couple of things

the least obstruction of justice in the body was moved in a story was manufactured\nOr murder\nRap whatever it is it doesn't it even or even if this was the bird and the FBI didn't use their proper

letter\nWhile the eight paying today promise the number of people that call on the media world here in in Washington and elsewhere that they were going to do a dispatch may have been you know a short story but it would be a story\nAnd when people are calling up they said yeah we did it we're doing it or we did it when we find out what did it meant was to paragraph three paragraphs at the end of a very long article on white water and Senate hearing\nAnd he told the FBI and the park police that there was a Hispanic man sitting next to Boston car watching it a menacing him with very menacing looks followed him in the current edited the park and this is a witness left immediately um\nPark police never went and visited him to to be with him they spelled his name wrong in\nThe police report or when the FBI visited with him\nThe guy said well who wants to this man they gave you manage thing look it's a Mexican American man and the FBI interview statement states very clearly that the witness was unable to identify would be unable to identify on the line up or a composite sketch this man what\nWell there it is and the London telegraph this Sunday a composite sketch of the man he saw the park the FBI out and out\nLie in their report\nOut this would maybe be a mistake if it happened one when we have so many instances in this case you know there were two witnesses later in the park it sought to man and then around ... car they sat in on the record one guy was standing with long blond hair in front of false does harm to but the hood up\nJust before the body was that\nAll right look Chris you're pushing this one to the edge and ah you're beginning to now camp you know even in other words if the worst case scenario is true\nOh which seems now more likely than ever to me based on the forgery saying then you're tampering with forces that have already\nGone an awful long way here and have a ... an awful lot at stake and even though you're a big time reporter\nI'm\nI'm not convinced that you're safe\nRisk involved in anything you do I've taken those risks and will continue to take those risks because this is a very important story and uh uh you know the trip will have to pull away they may they fall on me that I'll just take that take that the when it comes\nYou know um I take it you've given some amount of sun to this though I mean what was so look\nIf in fact the this was a murder I Am one of the prime people behind expose again\nYeah I guess that's when I was saying\nWell look and look what you know here Mike Wallace did this teeth and I think I said this to you on the last time you know my brother called me up afterwards he said ... you know I've known you your whole life you've always been an honest person you've never won a lot of money you never want it to a big job on Wall street type person\nAnd I just watch this and it makes you sound like you're a ally or be or Charlotte and trying to make money yeah I took a pay cut to continue doing that story\nUm\nSo what do you say I mean how do you how do you argue against that Mike Wallace knew that they knew that I never reported the foster was left handed a first that with the Boston Globe but I was going to be held responsible for every era that any newspaper there ever done in this case\nI'm only in the Cape to people out there that\nDo look into it that I'm On the right track

down a thirty year old reporter that's how old I Am\nAnd try to destroy his reputation\nThat shows that I'm having an impact\n... if we look at it from the other direction\n... and I'm not making the charge but the implication is that the administration has control\nOf very large segments of the media and I'm not making that charge but you you could almost begin to believe that could be so because of the Associated Press under reporting because of sixty minutes going after you as they did\nUm and because the news now is so shocking\nThat it just it has to be out there and well I it's not so so what does that say I mean if you look at what it says it says a large portion of the media is in bed with the government\nWell or the came media I don't know if everyone but I came media the leaders on sixty minutes relief program you know Don you it has gone on the record producer payment it saying that he helped get Cornel what Clinton elected\nAfter the Jeff or flowers thing that he edited

what Chris Ruddy ah seems to have come up with here\n\nYou know Charlie is reaction of course I guess I you know I guess it's gonna be typical of the liberals and I guess there is going to be no way no escape from the accusation that I Am and Chris Ruddy is\nSimply going after this president and maybe it is that the midget liberal mind the myopic mind to the average liberal like Charlie cannot react in any other way even too serious\nOr not mid level but high level forensics expertise that absolutely demands an explanation demands an explanation and they can talk of the way by saying that it's I'm a conservative not ball rhetoric\nIt isn't even close Charles ended really reveals a great deal about you as a person that you would approach it that way I Am quite surprised quite surprised

noted by recent Hubble photographs a very strange spiral shape to the debris there is a piece that has broken off that is not thirty percent of the comment or somebody worried [laughter]\nIt is a piece that simply is reflecting probably because of the amount of material burning off at you know you take the dirty snowball if that's what it is your break off ... and you got fresh snow\nAnd so then that begins to get bright the question the good question is why is it bright at All right now in other words it's out beyond the orbit of Jupiter and whether you're talking about the nucleus of

I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're originally let out of jail and then it's kind of you if you can test and said yeah it was really sorry about that then you go what are some of the people said no I'm not going to get this or that I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nIs that right that ... that the nuance of the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their beliefs to all the things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great works of literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or in the population using under about fifty thousand balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the the Halloween or ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other\nTime of year where they they see the kind of bumped like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this this October you know these thirty one days October\nOh math math I mean some of the some of his only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really years they've been getting\nMore ... more a year round kind of tourist I'm ... not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff demanding restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and throw happens the biggest one is October which\nWill never go well I Do really I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state there they can make their entire year in the weeks that the teacher is open so I I Would never guess shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but but but what the realizing is there's so many tourists coming to say I'm over the course of a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum ... so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round as failing grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they are either written or unwritten about how people are too you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah and they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that especially like ... year round if you're on the other time of year there's not that many curbs\nBut in October for instance they are the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century um graveyard right in the middle of town there and fail and this year they had to like put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting overrun and people were like using the graves as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nThat do that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over ... start heading the train and start having their cars so there that's\nReally leading the ten pm\nYeah I Believe it's a ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for pushing this a hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight nobody around on Halloween\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets of Salem before the ...\nOh yeah yeah it was just going bad really bad that they got to\nGet them up before the ... or maybe they're doing the real wishing happens after all the tourists the GW ocher a and a Edgar Award winning author or thank you so much a season with the which the magic and may have Halloween and Salem, Massachusetts it is now on my bucket list thinks do you like I didn't have enough of my bucket list [laughter]\nAll right I have a great night in fact I'm checking off one when I go to ... in a couple of weeks I'll let you know about that coming up later on in November when I'll be back on Halloween are starting on Thanksgiving weekend\nFrom coast to coast day I'm All right so the story you're going to want to hear the story you're never going to forget\nThe men from the train next on coast to coast am busy in front of\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute a growing number of the online retailers are moving from clicks to bricks\nSeveral years ago many of them were saying that they would never adopt a physical retail strategy\nJim board vice president to see the property says online retailers are discovering consumers still like to touch products and bite them right away and he says having a physical store also provides a halo effect for a night retailers\nAnd the prosecution of potential murderers\nSo the result is a resistance to the expression of sentiment you know the the or sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial\nThis is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose mainstream\nYou know notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflamed the senses right that sensational journalism the kind of news writing that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily in it at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history\nNot even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail\nAnd Lynch somebody before trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a mocking bird or white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public\nInformed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the train\n[noise] uh but [noise] this is the same reason I Love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting\nCan go where true crime story can tell something crime reporting must not go right true crime is\nIt allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime before her death I interviewed I'm\nA true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric the focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish size the details\nOf somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn right they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think\nSo I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham that not run for your life [noise] ah\nAll because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell\nAnd the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate about who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter but take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so\nNot everything is a false flag up only a small percentage of such things I've ever happened not everything is die hard to that everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy that old radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today so\nI ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today say a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talked about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get justice next on coast to coast am this is Ian ... on it

Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's all clarity a graphic pattern and the murders if one occurred just south of Portland them back to curse just north of Portland or so that that would be a link between them\nThe fingerprints and blood and it meant nothing to them\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve ... the ... and Eighteen Ninety eight ... knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever it is the um ah\nThe ah by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and breakthroughs hadn't had had\nBeen achieved that had begun to make their way into courtrooms bought a ... it was it was a very slow process and I had a very infant pile stage\n[noise] men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nTracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper archives and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which as you point out had been\nA they had the dots hadn't even been conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person that ever started putting this this case together in this way\n[noise] ... yes we were\nExcept for the end of the the the the last year the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose from in Nineteen eleven a Nineteen twelve which\nWould runner and he was killing a lot of people but the earlier\nCrime we what we did was say look this this this murderer is way too experienced\nTo have started this and Nineteen eleven there has to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nThat we don't get started walking back toward the first crime\nThat's what I'm getting at is that nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year so successfully\nDumb luck and it is not all\n... ... I had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits to first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is\nAnd I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he gets his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... and seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and he would coverage track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd it is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New Yorker and and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York and because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last last murders and the series so are we\nIs just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Pam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because\nIt's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype crushed right he and he modeled he he he perfected that crime then successfully after that it\nIs is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media rent I mean there's sometimes there were some times you were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five [noise] the ah I think pretty well he used an axe to\nCommit the murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house was shot before he was hit in the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his\nBelt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and could front of him but um\nIt was not what he was trying to do but his wife would do if you had to do\n[noise] to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they're what the general answer the question is the crime stories\nAre fascinating to us because they they come from the parts of our\nOf ourselves that we don't like to talk about a all crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are a part of you and me I don't know you but\nBut they they\nAre part of everybody that I've had the pleasure

name wrong\nOr the or I [laughter] I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you know there should be a hit\nAnd and one of the things I learned from reading that is the ... ... who er was a an avid reader of crime stories\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have him at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it it's very common among writers to be avid readers Tolstoy was avid readers of crime stories because the ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nThat you do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from sports to me as I live in the sports world for the most part and the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that

finish that uh\n[noise] you're you're paying out here and I was not able to hear a lot of them\nI'm fading out no Kennedy that um I was just saying that you are presenting it as sort of a dichotomy of I'm working in the sports world is by day in writing crime that night\n[noise] yeah they are uh I was saying that crime stories are packed into it because they they uh come from the parts of ourselves that we don't like to talk about and don't normally talk about in the case of the man the train I didn't make a deliberate I'm caught poll entry into the subject\nI just got hooked like a fish\nOr I was I was I saw a documentary about the murders and ... called ... living with a mystery it's an extremely well done a documentary and far above the normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was my thing\nWhich is that it's relatively ...\n... murders are a part of a serious so I started I was just going to put an hour and to\nAnd to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became a week and the week eventually became five or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a true crime booked sure yes it is yeah you know and that's the interesting thing is to is is that true crime [noise]\nYou know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism\nUm except that in the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers who's the circuit writing preachers the ministers that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution\nAnd they would do a sermon just before the execution\nThat would try to provide the context for why this person was being executed and wide to community overall would benefit from his or her desk\nAnd it became it\nBecame an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this all just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their execution sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime narratives it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it's a hundred plus years leader in some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of I'm a ... a kind of healing anyway I'm not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that had happened\nMaybe some closure I'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just they vary that happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a a a great great aunt had been was one of the victims of\nCrime Internet here and always believed\nThat uh uh the man who uh was accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released\nAlways believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book bag and our book that uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief correct yeah\nIt was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a ... it was said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it was the other fellow at I don't know why it was important to him\nTo go out I understand for the understanding that there was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it and punished I I I don't know that there's a lot of different but\nStill does have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think what we can go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book them a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all all good books our church for understanding and\nA lot of the book here is trying to get people to understand the America and which is crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago and ah I grew up in a small town very much like the crime that these ... that these murders occur to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them and that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was\nA watery or what\nHow people live that they they lived rich meaningful live\nA papal\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happened to people in small towns I mean they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that happened ... who happen to have happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately if a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they died terrible Beth I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like being in America and in a small town a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling a story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the town or\nThe um the things that people age or the way that houses were constructed or their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the\nIn these communities\nAnd then there's ... there's what is it that always sticks with me that trait that party or the right thing and that has to do with the the taco in the case of taco invented that it\nUh one of them I think it would suck co were had an alibi for the time of one of the crime one of the crime was committed on December twenty four of I think\nNineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors and an Italian community um a\nPickle deal because pickled ... were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickle deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in on on ice for a couple of days before you eat them\nThe a ... it's ... it's a tiny detail that you would right that would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian as a way to tell you an American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important in a crime story ... that's what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that illuminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know [laughter] but I think that brings us very effectively ... Iowa I'm ended the crime story which\nAs you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a ... a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn on the night of a gym nine Nineteen twelve\nOh the lights were out in Alaska due to a um\nA dispute between the ... city council and the power company so they had city lights in the street lights but they were out in ... and the town was in complete darkness or the Sunday night there was a church service\n\nRadio W Indian [noise]\nBelts are really into video games casino games not so much\nThe industry's moving in the direction of trying to attract younger adults who are less predisposed to gamble than their baby boomer ... predecessors\nSo casinos are experimenting says Brian ... senior analyst at Bloomberg intelligence this year the Luxor in Las Vegas opened an e sports arena and if you build it they may come but will they stand\nI think the real challenge for that property in for the casino industry in general is trying to determine whether or not those younger patrons who might be interested in Fort Night in gaming will actually participated gambling\nAnother thing casinos are trying is letting customers pay electronically to their smartphones or other devices making it easier for patrons to spent\nThere's a bank of America survey showing that nearly sixty percent millennials have or would like to use a digital wallet compared to only forty percent of all responded\nThat could boost what has already got forty billion dollar a year commercial casino business Alisa parental Bloomberg Radio\n[noise]\nWants to end underpaid um how close we knew which\nWe're here to change all day with your chance to win one thousand dollars I wouldn't want thousand dollars a day every hour listening to use radio seven ten WINZ and\nPaddy challenge for your ... and when I feel I mean you could make it\nRained in front of your least favorite co workers driven by mobile bay Harley Davidson new ownership you attitude the Gulf Coast premier spot for all things Harley Davidson is where you can get a new army for as low as one oh nine a month find their events on Facebook there's always a party at\n...

from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so so I got the wrong [laughter]\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the men from the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nUm circumstances that are defining experiences in our life because that's how we know ourselves best\nSo somebody who might have grown up in a very dysfunctional households\nTends to cleave toward dysfunctional relationships not go the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act in so they keep re creating that until they break the habit I'm so fractals theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you said\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment tend to be thanks so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate by recreating the circumstances\nAlong the various realism of America\n[noise] well ... that's ... that there is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was\nA his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to them and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nAnd some variation but more specimens specificity as it got went along so that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the\nLater patterns get closer and closer to the first crime it's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that's\nThat's who he was that that's a that's how he knew himself I I don't doubt that Mr Miller had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth\nOr he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and he said he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd that the terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that is in any sense of justification for what he did that but I don't doubt that that was true of him\nAnd the the pedophilia piece\nUm especially abusing the courts that's what happened um speaks to the age in which he might have been sort of frozen\nEmotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just some barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and\nYou know there is speculation in the book because a lot of things we don't know about a year or have you you can have no after you're gonna have speculated of answer it's up to you I wouldn't speculate\nThat he had never killed anyone before he killed the uh the Newt and family and in Eighteen Ninety eight I I ... I wouldn't I don't I doubt they'd ever killed anyone before that because there's an obvious lack of planning and\nPreparation for the about ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I just\nVery much would respect that he had been adding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a while he had it had a chip on his shoulder it wasn't that like a nice guy and then he said he ... his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried it carried a banker pretty openly they are but I so I I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents\nTrue in about his life the um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that that's a great point we're headed gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which she grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there have been something which you know he knew he had to get on a ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do it so whether it's just one person who is the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm a nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm sociopaths ... are often rage killers and they they just you know they it it's a ... thing and and the ... they just they do it as a kind of release and I I Wonder whether that that first released came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse if there's a ... because he was not a ... he didn't have any charm it was not it was ... ... generally as a charming\nRight motives often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that maybe he was he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear ... know norm I Do not have normal fear and one thing that the parent about this the ... the ... and the trade is that from his crime is it ... it was not\nEven not acting in fear he was he was calm in the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with this so I just probably not that I should have made this this other point first\nThe story of a Paul Miller andme after the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten years or Fifteen\nAnd going to say well here's what the James's myth they miss this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed the whole story about a this crime and it when that guy Illinois and uh\nThe I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research capacities so we moved on and part of the book but there is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers are coming up just a second demand

killer Bill James is the author and it's a it's just a terrific read very good writer a and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot I mean he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't\nYou know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers it's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was like ten or in longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about these people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder [laughter] but there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks it oh yeah you know I I'm\nBill I got a couple of questions the first of all I Need you to answer for me again over shame eight and ... like one of the actor yeah\nAbout ... what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe ah I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the Alaska murders were committed\nAh it it's still it's still around and and the has been definitively tied to the to the murders than the uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAgain you know what this palm will will gauge by any chance\nNo we don't it disappeared even ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be that he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured out I figured he might have worked for the world road is how he got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but a thank you for being on the air and I appreciate your story\n... that he actually that's a really good question too about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\nWhether what a in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on weekend this is taking to be a sign that he's employed or if a ... and if it happens a lot actually up there quite a few serial murderers who will who committed murders on\nWeekends or the or\nBecause they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to the um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working himself into the trap stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that he threw a lotta stocking\nBut uh the just war game itself into the frame of mind that he could get where you needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or what do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you\nKnow he was he was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen a ... and ... and he he came into town\nMay no contact with anyone spoke to no one and this pair that was part of his criminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so he he ... his first crime in the ... crime and Eighteen Ninety eight he\nDid buy a ticket to leave\nThe town and this this led to a trail forming behind him and place followed his\nWhere he had gone on the trains are for quite a while but later he was just it was his job as white used to railroad he always always used at the intersection of two railroad so they were trained came by the middle of night he could just hop on I mean it wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to we'll road you're less chance of the year\nThey'll be you'll be stranded waiting for trying to ...\nYeah that's an interesting question that really forgot what it was\nNo that's an interesting point then it by the way when I told you about the the people that were murdered\nNext to the railroad line in the town where I grew up they um that was the shoe sure the shoreline it was it's the the train no longer existed um after like Thirty years or so but he used to be the major commuter rail road between\nMilwaukee and a Chicago I think or maybe even went further up north up to to like Green Bay or something or\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen oh eight or thereabouts\nHe a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes there that area\nAfter Nineteen oh eight he started just morally more or less trapping it became a Nineteen Nineteen awake at night and Kenny transition to just running loose cross the country bought an interesting thing is that he never stole\nMoney that one of the ways you know with him is that lie this line well up here in the newspaper story about\nMoney and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there was a he he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah and that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that\nUh that that guy little was accused of than it was a a robbery in and it yet you know ... at the same time the let me ask you about the acts so the ... why do you think he would leave the is this the murder weapon at the scene I understand like\nIn the godfather right when you wrap the\nHandle and you know drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever but it would seem like even then that would be some evidence to to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nWell up ... fingerprints exploded and the understanding of the American public in Nineteen eighty four Ninety five and his first crime he just dropped the acts I'd left his buddy fingerprints on the on the acts\nUp mud once people became aware of the fact that fingerprints then he would wash the handle they act in a bucket of water before leaving the and the crime it ... to ... every every wherever the second half of his of his career\nThey ah ah which proves that he was connected to what was going on I probably read newspapers and knew what was going on or see a but it just a drop the acts because it would have been awkward to take it with him while he was fleeing or if he once he was out of the house he was\nUnconnected to the murders but if he was carrying an accident that would have connected them to the murder\nWell okay so let me just making an argument for that\nThat it still seems odd to me because you can actually say I'm a longer that's why I carry my ex with me right right I mean there there is any occupation where somebody could walk into the next day would be either like firefighter or longer [laughter] you know you only two that you are going up um\nBuying but they all ... among us who did he worked as a matter but there are some of the I think he did\nAt the ax is that he used word they lumbering type of act as\nIf it was a mostly a like an act that was found in would pile ... almost all of the house ... murders were uh were houses burn wood um times\nCoal a buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the cold right\nHe would he would use the coal actually the boy that would actually whatever you found
