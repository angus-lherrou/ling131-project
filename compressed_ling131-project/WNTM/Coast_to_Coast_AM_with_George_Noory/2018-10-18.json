Jefferson once said there are two ways the cocker an inch labor nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is or\nJust enough to cover the costs of administering the program\nWhere does the lending money come from Alan Paulos before these loans\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out [noise] uh and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education [noise] ah ended sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that essentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter]\nAh but um so yeah this is a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit [noise]\nUh and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws are in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there\nAre also fared collection practice laws federal um a fruit than lending laws [noise]\nAh and these again are restricted or it's completely remove a for the case of federal student loans who came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of this really comes back to sort of a swamp\nThe beltway ... ball of bankers ah which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise] uh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes\nServed on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the nexus of when this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise to a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord\nA bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae who had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system [noise]\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nAh like many of the state run Gehring tours in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could to make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent who use child has a ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give up at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices treatment lending a state you three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank guinea private line of credit [noise] ah and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type of loan\nWhatever happened to the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know Georgia of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ground serves even state funding cetera can keep up with their budgets um\nYou know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University is now Seventy thousand dollars a year well I can guarantee ... per year that's tuition room board books um\nFor for your course for a four year college and\nBy the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad is now six point two year\nWhat happened well again\nThe colleges are sitting in the cat per seat vacant because there's this lending program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and and the other lenders are willing to pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices\nBut also really stream the students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the per year cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt\n... there was a story just recently we're losing a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder dental a belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt you know strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um they have to charge a huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond in shaping Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how this student loan problem is\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety billion dollars in interest clicking off that's\nNinety billion dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses Skilling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be felt\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Alan Collins when we

N. D. M. [noise]\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to ... with us we're going to take your calls as we talk about the student loans scam what was that Alan that made you get involved in this\n[noise] oh well I had a um I had student loans I have three reason engineering and hum I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time [noise] uh and I tried everything I could to keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there was too long as it's falling into\nA is a lineage system that actually want you to default and so they will lose your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bamboozled you and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me and my loans very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and [noise]\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine ah and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government refused to be interviewed I might\nAdd a and so it's sort of snowball from there I\nUnfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project to get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch\nAnd I'm hopeful that will change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits or have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that kept the short end of the stick\nAnd by that I mean a you've got these payday loan center outrageous and predatory or that or gear marked for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time\nYou've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy\nAre these um secondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them with just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look how great reviews you go in and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no break any wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no break\nYou know [laughter] uh and in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night an expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the ... system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy what's what's the tuition why can't Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running\nYou know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price\nEven at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased uh on that scale and so it's you know\nUnless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you\nOh fifty sixty thousand bowls yeas crazy so this has just\nGotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job in a part time job during college will\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen thank you\nI got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big signs they throw support sealed their he left right after the whole ...\n[laughter]\nI Love it but uh anyway I I I Want to drive a little bit of a trade school to a ... a former company I used to work or I got on egg wildly\nAnd when a company went under the owners of the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now\nYou know it was a sad time but ah pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I Love her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let me thanks as well as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too\nWell and I think ... years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nAnd I looked at the local schools they were to import dollars just to go for oh I think it was a two wars there is no one said well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going out and I spent thousands of dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive and then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that it's not up for about half the price now they've been\nLet's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's\nIt's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools are as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on um it's gonna crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college did\nOkay I already knew that bill Bennett hypothesis but now there's one thing that I wanted to mention and that is the ... I'm a conservative everyone knows that I'm the guy that almost won I lost a forty three\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was ... acres that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nThey have no public a benefit the inspiration they just send all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're gonna come back and take final culture with you in just a moment here on coast to coast am\n... the new version of it goes to goes to a a map is now available for I'm going to end now Android ... lives in line we're on demand anywhere anytime sort of goes to ... dot com and downloaded today\nUse radio you know when you when you bring you\nThis is a Bloomberg mark admitted the Labor Department report on first time claims for unemployment benefits will be out before the markets opened this morning economists surveyed by Bloomberg think the number of new applications to lower last week after rising in the prior week\nWeekly updates on consumer comfort and mortgage interest rates are also on the way the conference board will release index of leading economic indicators and the Philadelphia fed well report on regional manufacturing activity\nDavid summer being event core advisors says the third quarter earnings reports that have been released so far have been encouraging he's paying close attention to what executives are saying in their earnings calls\nI'm going to be very interested forward guidance ... month of October particular their companies begin to really think hard about that next calendar years sales and earnings prospects\nThe list of companies scheduled to report today includes American Express travelers pay pal sculptures and double duty forty ...

these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the lists or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't the scammers\nAre yes there are a lot of ... cameras out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sound\nExactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall ... who they can assure through this alone rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan

Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and all or a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off my credit report and lo and behold this ... this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nI Hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information has a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the uh uh costs that I've heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can get me to I tried to negotiate directly with the deal he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Ellen what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would\nNever deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy rates back\nSo that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies I'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education\nAt this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\n[noise] so I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent of the get alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you you can do but certainly dealing with a very close you know like like what you describe\nIt and they get the information Allen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this republic that clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good [noise]\nUm but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the note rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you\nNever heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are strong beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and ...\nMy leaders down the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nWell what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent particularly for older loan which is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nFrom [laughter] not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens in the Pentagon

you great job indeed\nAliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nI can actually it is a new documentary that I put out the story and taking your grandma [laughter] but you're right that story and really in one human tree\nPatel as as best as I can the entire story of the U.S government for ... relationship with this phenomenon of ah watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of that\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single\nRevelation now in in the UFO community for I I think decades I the only story that I think comes close and I would say this wouldn't tie is the de kinds of vacation and release of the British Government files but the the revelation\nThat off two decades have to know all the U.S government did have a UFO program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and you're like you say for years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this this knowing ... there were no investigations\nAnd of course they were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try to train on tangle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment polls there all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this but Robert big yellow a Senator Harry Reid charmed along I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up in honey you track all this stuff is coming from all different directions these days\nI think the answer that one is is very cautiously and very carefully and and I absolutely in meticulous detail\nBecause I think the problem with this story in one sense\nFor years people have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's just about a case for the deep specialists ah it's a difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mass if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on\nDecember sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out will to first than a than a third one but now the public has been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this won't strong guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman\nAnd and they're struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back and and give people an overview of this from my end Slater perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot into it of course tonight Pentagon but tell us specifically about\nWell I took a logs on on on this one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and and you've done this of course civilian times yourself you know you sit in the ... said\nA direct tech kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this I when you see the final product sometimes you think well well you know I go edited down to a few soundbites and\nI Wish they'd put it in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did decide teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would ... the thing so scripted the entire movie ... the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think the laws\nScript for this and and so in that way I have absolute control of this and then literally I went into a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it\nThe whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a direct to who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving seat having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can well I\nCan't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFor me it's a completely new role to me I I there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose just made a a a great movie but um\nYou know I I was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with the Pentagon\n[noise] firstly I as I say really to try to go through some of\nThe the confusion about what's been going on just how the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this I think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that\nThat this field has is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but\nThey don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand\nWe go on to the platforms that the young people the watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days so it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food and video and all those sorts\nOf things so the the aim was to take their subjects not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd\nBut but too young to get people and and another thing is you know it's been a year since domed along ... had his press conference\nWhere he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I Do ... ah you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon don't want to reignite the U.S and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization Dewey ... nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you say the organization I'm E. E. T. I. P. O.\nYes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said well he always says in these sorts of situations only as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts\nAnd friends that he he says it's still going now are the people I think have disputed that and certainly\nThe reporting season to Stuart its early stages but David sour ...

defense and and he ... the um lost two miles in in the what's now being a ten year program to declassify and release them\nSo I think it's it's a perfectly reasonable moved to say yeah we we should have a space for us but I think some of some of the Komen trip out there so it's been a little far fetched I mean it'd be something from a ... movie by actually aliens I mean it's it's more about DOMA nineteenth future space\nWell are you exactly but what do you think about the late president Ronald Reagan's attempt to get the star wars technology going some people thought it was to protect us from some kind of alien or intervention\nAnd he certainly made of course those remarks are very famously in front of the U.N Security council when he said I occasionally saying how quickly we we would set aside our differences down here on it if if we face some alien threat and and of course people read\nAn awful lot into those remarks and then they saw the star wars program and they read read a law
