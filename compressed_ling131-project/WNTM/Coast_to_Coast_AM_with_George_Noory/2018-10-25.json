civil war\nTroop ... when they go back and look at the things that have happened in the recent past they they immediately think that you know we are in the civil war\nEspecially when they're young something like ... symmetrical warfare an ideological warfare people tend to think it has to be always an armed conflict that's why the guy says what's the definition of war and I says well\nIt's an armed conflict civil wars on the other hand are are armed at times and at times they're not armed sometimes their ideological wars sometimes their spiritual wars\nSometimes there are warring factions with in certain groups where there'd be right or left how many faction of groups that we heard the KKK the Nazis the communist or I could go down the list of black lives matter meat too\nI mean just go down the list of all of the factions are at war with each other right now none of them pulling guns on people but yet we have somebody who ideologically disagrees with Hillary Clinton the

President Trump this is certainly one sided and it's there just to basically heart and the resolve of the persecution complex to the left it's obviously obviously this is what is happening\nOr a yes or am I still on yeah go ahead okay I'd also like to say that um I Believe that was Mark Twain said a patriot as one who is scorned at first\nBut when others join him it cost them nothing and I believe firmly that that might be Donald Trump\nIt might be and it might not be a history will have to decide that they'll have to say that history decides everything there the last say Brighton,

furniture and all security\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing them is to try to make Republicans look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying\nYou know Trump and his rhetoric has made you know things he he's created an environment so somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict from our authorities in an intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country\nI'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas\nVigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that way in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this is a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat as your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy we're all\nOn the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast\n[laughter] but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you've been honest I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's the proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nAnd those on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others\nHe was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public I mean\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer\nYou cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their ... keeps their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced and law enforcement uh individuals\nAnd are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community entire us an intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd be somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight\nShut up wait let the intelligence officials do their job then wants their job is completed and they've determined who've done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America you know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the weight empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute\nThe greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let's continue unless top this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ... we will talk this week\nAnd see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin

probability of being tracked down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time has been very very high um ... agree I mean these are all unexploded devices that mean\nOh kind of trace evidence is available from them as they are all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the U.S some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nAnd then I just want to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire ah UFP of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the sorting\nGot pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post off camera\nAt the post office or ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you want it to have the evidence is almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days are certainly a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this some of these questions are are going to start to uh [noise] that would be possible\nAt least you'll find out about a minute left the wire optics story real quick\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individuals I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet\nIs are we going to be able to afford it are the highest is going to raise the bad with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole application for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed new van system in the high rent urban areas they haven't showed a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas so there's that question to are we ever going to actually see it depending on where you live\nOr am I from Lauren thank you so much will be in touch with you this week as well while a lottery ticket holder in South Carolina has scoop the largest jackpot in us history\nMega millions confirmed that was one winner for the one point six billion dollars\nLet's see how that would be a he's probably obviously meeting with his lawyer on accountants or she is and will figure out what's going on in a moment we'll be talking about dark forces demons with which that's right next on coast to coast day um [noise]\nIf you ever experienced heart racing\nShortness of breath or dizziness it's possible you could add a trio ... one of the leading causes extra mind out before too late with cardio among the FDA cleared personal EKG divide that just Ninety nine dollars to order that Amazon dot com and titan cardio ...\nFamous on dot com anti cardio mobile mobile fits\nIn your pocket you can take it EKG anytime anywhere right when you\nFeel is endemic cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone and just thirty seconds you'll know if your heart rate than it's normal for in a trio the relation is detected border cardio mobile today for just Ninety nine dollars [noise] there's an Amazon dot com type of cardio mogul\nNo longer\n\n\n\n\nDo you have ... morning one use radio doubled you in the um [noise]\n\nThis is a Bloomberg marketed minute the kind of a survey by Bloomberg sink this morning's government reports will show a decline and durable goods orders and up to a new one on employment claims MBA slight narrowing of the merchandise trade gap\nReports on pending home sales mortgage interest rates and consumer comfort are also on the way along with the big batch of corporate earnings reports that could help the sphere the stock market John Buckingham of el ...

by black magicians um [laughter] I thought it was already on edition or a group that\nI Know it was alright and clarify a magician and it can actually send you an earth bounce spirit and what they do

word against it looks like they're about one point six climates per star\nUpper galaxy star and our galaxy the Milky Way ahead of them have a hundred billion star all that\nMeans one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the place\nAnd you know and that changed as our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization or around and\nWe're at the top of the heap well roll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course are not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd it leaves plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we come to realize that you know get in here from there is not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing

but now there's word there may be another one out there with a former vice presidents many minorities\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing to try to make Republicans look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has\nYou know thing he's created an environment for somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that now you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get your fish will verdict from our authorities intelligence communities in the United states and then\nThe American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked but we have to understand that at the grassroots level\nAmerica as best we can debate ideas\nAre vigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate\nFormer presidents and leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever did that whoever did it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that way in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this air that would give them my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you bid on it I've heard your commercials saying\nListen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other and that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping and I are our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public eye and said you know if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer\nYou cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep their ... their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced in our law enforcement uh individuals and\nAre individuals in institutions in in the intelligence community entire us an intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and who ever did this\nWith somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd be somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media saying that President Trump still this weight\nShut out wait let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who've done this then we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America you know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that just the weight empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said go out they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue unless stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ... we will talk this week\nAnd see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Solomon as described the killing of ... is a heinous crime in his first comments and some of his closest aides were implicated in the Saudi journalist death\nSpeaking edited investors conference in Riyadh that has been overshadowed by this crisis been sold them and said that those responsible for the killing would be brought to justice\nFacebook could collapse of it keeps being dogged by scandals or misinformation\nAnd election hacking says the author of a ... book on the

this new development and fiber optics make Internet speeds up to a hundred times faster by detecting light that has been twisted into a spiral\nThe research published in the journal nature communications can be used as easily upgrade existing networks and significantly boost a fish and sea let's check in with our expert Warren Weinstein on the Internet boy this would be amazing born\nBefore I comment on that I like to make a technical comment on on the fence today\nUm I I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this being tracked down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time as as being very very high um for purely technical reasons I mean these are all unexploded devices that means\nAll kind of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the U.S at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire a USB of network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the sorting\nGot pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office camera at\nThe post offices ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days or certainly in a short period of time we're going to find out who's behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to uh [noise] of the possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left the optics door really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individual I think the question it always comes up when you when we talk about higher speed Internet\nIs are we going to be able to afford it or the ISPs going to raise the band with caps enough so that we won't use up our whole allocation for the month and in two minutes\nAnd where it's going to go because right now the ISPs have tended to put the high speed a new advanced system in the ah high rent urban areas they haven't showed a lot of interest and putting them into rural areas so there's that question to are we ever going to actually see it depending on where you live\nOr a my friend Lauren thank you so much will be in touch with you this week as well while a lottery ticket holder in South Carolina has scoop the largest jackpot in us history\nMega millions confirmed that was one winner one point six billion dollars let's see how that he's probably obviously meeting with his lawyer on accountants or she is and will figure out what's\nGoing on in a moment we'll be talking about dark forces demons with which that's right next on coast to coast they um [noise]\nI Am Kevin ... would be again and we all know Kevin from we're Capitol we're here to talk about bitcoin Kevin I was surprised when you called me and said you were also getting into crypto currency is what's going on\nWith George we've set up a specific program that allows people do hold crypto currency inside their IRAs well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin ... gold or silver are are\nNot at all we give investors the option don't both in their IRA\nNo no no\n\nNo no\n\nWe\nDon't have ... news radio seven ten doubled un P.
