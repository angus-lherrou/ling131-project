longtime friend the coast to coast am a porch and Mitch is a very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here I always a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nA today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me\nIt's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and ah it's a big bridge that I've cross with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nOr their motto was try that that just one more try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members some of that club\n[laughter] that was probably about five of them they were just a little group on one side of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith San says and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with their sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nComments at us and believe it or not was a member of the original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether edits and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan doubled day we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experiment with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe the thoughts are cause of death I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental\nPicture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that we give people concrete hands on math and\nWhat do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start\nReading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off until I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can find a miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're a very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long\nInterval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a thought and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives they will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found that people who dabbled with the dark side tend to do some of the similar things that the positive people do but that's something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we faced these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she could be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities\nThat responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that\nHowever we may feel buffet by\nThe winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in events mentally and and often these shows up in ways that we don't suspect so my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about\nAbsolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives\nOf others I had a rebel or on before you came on and he's he was in Israel and of course great mental list and it was telling us the story\nAnd how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland and over the stadium they put him in a helicopter in ... he was supposed to influence\nThe ball and and I guess when when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved in and the guy missed it or something like\nThat [laughter] now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor arrive and go into your bedroom and drop picture and so I haven't went in his bedroom drew a picture came out and said you drew a house and I have and was shocked and said that's absolutely true\n[laughter] I Know we had gr Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program\nWas talking about a tie class episode yet at NASA tie class in the ... or or type pin and he lost and you couldn't find it and

but\nBack to these miracles and we take calls next hour\nI'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but back to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but you know that'd be too but you know people dabble in the dark side they curse other people they put ... on other people\nIn in a lot of cases those things happened to these people you know how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know we we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect however one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind power tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project negatives spell or thought on to another person\nIs if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds to use so in a certain sense well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection against evil forces and I want people to listen to that very ...\nProbably because we're apt to overlook familiar things we're apt to overlook temple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there is an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical research the quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time as basically a very powerful illusion that we use\nAre going to intrude upon how we experience these things so

select\nAnd a great time to use an affirmation that just needs to be spoke it does not need to be spoken out loud a great time to use an affirmation\nIs those few very relaxed moments just before you drift off to sleep at night sleep researchers call that the hitting the gothic state it is a state of time when you can not only reprogram your own psyche\nThrough repeating affirmation Z or prayers or holding visualizations but but cyclical researchers have also found that those few moments before you drift asleep at night are prime time in essence Patel a path or extra sensory activity mysterious things occur\nWhen people hold African nations in mind or silently repeat them to themselves in those few moments just before going to sleep at night that he is an exquisitely unusual supple\nSuggestible time it's a time that each of us experiences every day you also experience it just as you're coming to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\nIt it seems to work doesn't it\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my mantra is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on a computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've\nActually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the things that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night think about it as much as possible and when things on that list\nCome to you and over time they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all don't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent\nBecause sometimes you share these things with other people and the roll their eyes are those say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it\nAnd when the results arrive express things that's a method we can all do\nAnd it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIt is easy ... the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and it's to do it with total stark honesty\nArriving at a definite aim in life or a a a a a small number of things that coalesce around one aim has enormous power and aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass were prism\nThey become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light natural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing and the idea that you have to really nail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's worth focus comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George and I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions that I never could have expected\nI've done television narrating\nAnd and and and written many books and articles including in places that are not known for their a cult enthusiasm I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible\nAnd so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know ... it's a dream come true and the most literal sense\nYou know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do be patient sometimes things happen quickly but sometimes the gestation period has also necessary\nIt is amazing work how people get this membership into the

everybody who's listening is automatically a member of the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun of people had a little
