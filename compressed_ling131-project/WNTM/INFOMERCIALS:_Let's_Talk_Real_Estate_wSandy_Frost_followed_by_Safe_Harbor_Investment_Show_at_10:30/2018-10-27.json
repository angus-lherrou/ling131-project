much to say in order to live company when the time comes\n... survey found that fifty nine percent of workers fill a somewhat stressed about preparing for retirement just twenty three percent of workers within five years or time are very confident and how much they need to live comfortably we're finding their reason for that is and that's our oh articles about\nGuaranteed income need for guaranteed and we've been preaching Garrett income are you know for a long time\nAnd the other night that was a seminar over the odd club and one of the big brokerage houses and guess what they were talking about guaranteed income but they didn't tell the vehicles they don't have the vehicles for guaranteed income what they were referring to was annuities\nBut there are no these are mostly ... or ... they don't have ... like we have in our new to the best vehicle for guaranteed income out their bar now there's nothing better ... benefits that we have we have with nursing home features and things like that\nRight Jim and you know when I was a a broker in my past I'm at the some of those large wire houses a gym I was\nA I was only confined to a set number of products\nAre in other words I Can't I couldn't do what we can do now which is\nYou know open up the entire store to everybody because we can get a license with anybody we want to out there so we truly can find the correct product and not and not have the ... the person into a product that's the only they can sell so it's a it's a great advantage we have\nWhy is it you have brought up that others don't well brokers houses don't allow themselves our new because basically taking them out of the market they want they want him to be in the market that's their job to sell securities in stocks bonds mutual positive
