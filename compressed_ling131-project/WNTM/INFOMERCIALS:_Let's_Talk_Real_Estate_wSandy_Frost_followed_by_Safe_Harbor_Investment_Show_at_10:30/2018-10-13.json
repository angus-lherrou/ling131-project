more expensive than others you know the obvious would be if you're in an older home you know a Fifteen year old house even has a new roof on the house that that can get you a pretty good discount another simpler won a would be a a monitored security system\nThat's the easiest most cost effective way to to get it there's a lot of systems out there um shop around and see what you can do but you can get a significant discount or you know a few hundred dollars\nOff your homeowner's policy might pay for the the security system for the year ...\nIt I got the same thing on my\nFirst time a let's talk about flooding shine catch seems kind of timely\nIt is you know it's it during hurricane season especially this year uh everybody knows what happened up in the Carolinas with\nTons of floods right now in Texas there's a lot of floods going on oh and by the way there's a big storm in the Gulf as as we're talking right now there's a huge storm out they're coming into dust and and um there are people are concerned about flood insurance and a lotta times\nYou know your your homeowner's policy is not going to cover flood insurance and if you have if you don't have a mortgage\nAnd you're not into floods um that doesn't mean that your house can't flood\nWell look at all the houses flooded during Katrina that had that didn't have flood insurance that never had had sledding before and the people were adolescent\nThen they're not going to get paid on a claim no you don't have flood insurance it's it's it's excluded from every homeowner's policy it's a separate policy you have to purchase um\nWe have FEMA writes it we also have other private markets that have come in that that are riding and as well but it's it's a big deal I've had multiple homes in West ... not an floods and now we're close to the bay now we're close to\nAny kind of water source except for your your afternoon flooding that are flooded this year three of them\nWell you know and if you're not in a flood zone flood insurance is extremely affordable\nCompared to the damage that that water will calls is it's very very affordable and even if even if you're home a guy tried to call one of these clean up services and see what the rights are it's\nThe little bit that you pay for the flood insurance is nothing compared to the headache and and paying those companies I don't want to name any names but it can run into the thousands and thousands of dollars\nSo [noise] what his flood insurance cover\nFlooding shirts well let's let's talk about a flood first what is a flood flood is when water rises out of its normal boundaries and causes damage to your home I mean it's it's simply not rainwater\nFalling through your roof for a hole under roof it that's not a flood and sexual flood actual water's coming up and that can be a sewer backup it could be\nA storm drain backup if you live in midtown mobile you know what I'm Talking about as far as storm drains backing out there are certain streets the movie that every time it rains and African shower there's water like two or three feet of water and the road well\nMy house I'm I'm On top of a hill and mow bill and a few years ago the same thing happened\nYou know the drain backed up and guess what I got what are my house really fast so that's that's what ... is water coming into your home\nFor for through any recent any reason any reason so um [noise] let's talk about the flood zones\nFloods and as you know if if you're about to say if you're even well I say the ... let's let's use airport boulevard for example um airport at Florida Strait\nRight through there there's a flood zone because there's a creaky ... creek that runs through town um\nThat's where we have an advantage folks we don't have any of your assets at risk we believe in safety in in putting investments you can't lose money and that's what we do lie and and it goes on to talk about the five things that you should look for it and and investments and a\n... educate yourself to investment decisions would this investment helped me achieve my personal portfolio objectives Cape your objectives his safety guarantee day I can if it's liquidity you know you want to keep it liquid wouldn't do that for you to know\nGay destined investment option make my make business sense yeah you know you got to ask shoved as it makes sense for me to have to guaranteed income down the road or to keep my money's site\nGive up a little equality for safety you know you have to answer these questions is your best to land with my risk portfolio and timeline for maybe ... that's something we look at too we said you're Seventeen years were damaged or in retirement you know we have a solution for you if you're Twenty years from retirement you know you could afford a rash and\nStay on the market you know that's what we tell people how might lose money with this investment well aren't ... say you can't lose money with most of them\nWe do manage money which is controlled risk factor\nBut most of our products have no risk involved in the other question was my exit strategy how am I going to get out of the product and that's what we talk about and help people with to trigger income take withdrawal or white to surrender bridge over to get out to do that too but generally we're talking to people that Seventy years out\nYou know Jim uh people get complacent and their their portfolios and a good well we've had a ... most of them are out there for you know twenty or Thirty years to some degree or some extent they get complacent with it and uh the exit strategy is a very important part of the overall plan\nAnd uh I Would be way through the gift that most people don't have an exit strategy\nAnd a lot of people live for talking about the market's going crashed like the dot com bubble\nDifferent things like that asks pays on track for the longest losing streak since November two thousand six Dane and no question we asked us if you're at retirement or or in retirement and you're drawing from that investment you're kind of double dip and that means you're drawing ... going down to\n... and you also have to fight inflation and you also have to pay taxes soda quadruple hit\nJoe right and that's what we try to protect against and and we show you how to keep them money liquid to protect against inflation would not get a guaranteed income\nWe had a yesterday a client and their bill and he said he never said advice that we give them they may have been several visors and they basically don't buy the stop by this that and there have been very risky stuff and it was not doing very well in that\nAnd he wanted the dice and we talked to him back guaranteed income and different things like that and his wife wanted safety you want to risk it out we showed her how to get no risk at all and they're very satisfied what we showed them\nTo encourage you to call safe harbor financial services and Daphne so they can show you as well\nWe all for complimentary consultation to our radio program listeners all you have to do is pick up the phone and call it's a local call and Daphne, Alabama at six to five one to two six six to five one to two six or ...\nFree eight seven seven to five one Nineteen eighty four\nEighty seven seven to five one Nineteen eighty four\nYou know Jim uh I just want to read a couple of headlines here this is from a Forbes may say the next recession will be here sooner than we think of oh by the way Social Security has a coal of of this year in two thousand nine team will be two point eight percent\nWe know it's more than ... ...\nRight exactly exactly so then we have a\nA money markets two thirds of the S. and P. five hundred is in a correction as sell off worsens yes okay now these are coming from articles not there's not a Gemini there's a there's a whole other articles are expert Ron Paul says fifty percent market plunge will push us into a recession\nFolks it's a you know these are these are folks out here that are saying the same thing the gym and I've been saying for quite some time now nobody knows exactly you know when that may occur but\nI have to think about the uh the hurricane and we need to say prayers for all the folks that got affected by that hurricane yes but even in a hurricane you know besides the heating of the warnings to get out go find safety\nGo someplace else you still have some people that are complacent\nAnd sit around and say oh I'll just ride this thing out this is just another storm I've been through many hurricanes and um you know been scot free\nHad a little rain a couple of lightning bolts and things like that well same same people do the same thing in the stock market you get complacent okay and uh I'm not going to worry about it I've been in the you know doing it for twenty or Thirty years and\nYeah I went through a thing back in two thousand and went through the thing of two thousand date and you know yeah I lost money whatever when I'm a ride this thing out west point is is that you know how long it was a time do you have to ride it out and get your money\nBack and the question is why risk it just like well why risk it and the hurricane why risk it with your retirement exactly riding it out means as you said Jim not only losing money but you're not earning money either and\nNobody's earn money and a good while in the market has been really going downhill for quite a while even over the last year it was stagnant we've seen people that make any money\nJim and that's another good point you bring up because I Want to tell folks out there that\nAre even when there is the market is sideways flat are stagnant okay you're not making money and if you're in retirement you're still taking money out of it so it's it's lowering your bank account you know you want to ask yourself what you and your wallet [laughter] but ah\nAnyhow ah so being stagnant this is not as bad as the market going down but it still is not a good place to be\nNo you're not making money and if you're trying to get in the market goes you want big returns on the market you got to take a risk with it too\nAnd this is a downside of the risks and right now in doubt dropped almost eight hundred points of the day because everyone is afraid of something they just not trust the market right now and and we had the interest rate ill that rising they're called ... Warren\nBuffett even said on CNBC the other day why in the world are people keep pumping money into something that's not real there's no basis for where we are right now and and this is coming from a tried and true investor Warren Buffett and uh so that ought to tell you something right there folks I mean uh you know that's that's that's something to listen to\nIf you're a Thirty Years' old ride the market out it will come back but if you're at or near a time at whatever age at night day and we get and people want to retire early and early\n... we had a a a\nGuy named generic that he wanted to retire when work ten more years out at work when I showed him that he actually could retire now with more income that he's making his wife was sitting there going oh wow yeah\nEcstatic over that but but ah he liked his work and all that but I said well if you like you work at least worker safety to this guy was just said I you know I'm not saying\nThat said uh you know you could retire anytime you want to show you that so he invested a good deal of his money where they had a lot of money the money with us and uh he's got\nSome money put up that's an engineer folks okay so uh we get all kinds and our business and and ah\nWe have to go a lot of medicine on troops and stuff that are set out there about our products and different things like that but go back to the first shot a crowd ... experience somebody not only has degrees but has experience\nIn the bath and I both have over Thirty years pace in the business and we know and on different sides on\nDifferent sides with exactly makes it even more valuable you you're coming from the stock market right active right you're coming from the insurance perspective and we know that a happy medium is\nSomewhere in the middle man really has over sixty years experience but I don't mean to tell him that 'cause\nYou don't may tallies age she's eighty years oh yeah and that's coming from a guy when he looks in the mirror first thing in the morning you know you look at looking at All right Bye bye [laughter] I like I should have anywhere and by the way everybody liked my joke by that one really was a good job good job market on the calendar Jim burn called a\nFunny show and I got some nut job you know bottom lace Vegas call up a Guinness Book of world records on that one\n[laughter] much our seminar dates yeah yeah\nOctober twenty fifth as a brick it immobile um and then on October thirtieth is that the original washed her house on the causeway\nYeah those are very good restaurants good turnout stare brick catches a steak place and then I think\nIt is um the uh what was the name of outback used to be there for many years and so a brick yes took over the outback place\nThe seminar is a great way to not only have a good meal and meet you too in person but to learn more\nThan what you may hear on the radio program and we offer our listeners to call for either the complimentary confrontation or seats at an upcoming banquet so please call safe harbor financial services L.
