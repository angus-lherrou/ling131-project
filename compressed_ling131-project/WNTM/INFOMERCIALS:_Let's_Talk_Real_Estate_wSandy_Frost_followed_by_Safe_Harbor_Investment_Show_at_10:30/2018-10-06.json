Ninety two thousand dollars a year and in this ... magazine you again okay\nYes I say it's an editorial from investment news memorizing\nAnd policies that we've got so expensive that people couldn't afford 'em and then they get harder to get the underwriting guidelines got harder and harder and harder to get\nIn gym also a there are a lot less fewer and fewer companies they're even offering long term care insurance because of the expense involved with it\nWill tell us about your plan what our products have um included and there's no wonder riding it if you buy the new deal from certain companies that has a long term care in there you'll get long term care included in that what it how it works basically is that\nWhat Iran Tom you qualify for if you buy an income and ability that income little double the confined to a nursing home or need home health care so it could pay way too by part away and putting on a much money you invest in them\nBut uh it is very popular people really like that and and I call it one of the three threats you got market risk you got low interest rate risk and you got to find that risk and we've got all three covered in our products in there and that's why they're so popular I our business is\nBooming mhm uh Beth speaking of interest rates the fed increased the interest rate last week right they did that is correct tell us on or tell us about that and what that means for us\nWell Laurie a ... a couple of different things first of all when interest rates go up bond prices go down I don't know a lot of people out there uh consider their portfolios is being conservative or because they have bond funds or or just straight out a municipal bonds or government bonds on there\nA while bonds are certainly a lot of slaves per se for them being a directly connected to a company or stock or they're not doing anything and you can lose money and bonds just like you can the stock market\nOr so or interest rates play a big part in the uh the overall economy as well and when they start seeing inflation rate going up then they try and control it with interest rates so therefore as a matter of fact I'm I picked up a mobile press register newspaper on Sunday which I normally do\nAnd they have a a a page and a called a personal finance\nA and they have a huge article on there about inflation just where we are talking about right now and uh some of the things that you can do\nFor during the inflationary period which there are several people in here are talking about that we are in an inflationary period anywhere between two to four percent six percent excuse me a now we know that inflation really is higher than two percent that's just what the government says it is\nA so it can have a I Know when interest rates go up than it has an effect on the stock market I remember back in the mid nineties I Believe it was when the dot com age\nWas a was out there and uh everybody jumped on board or the dot com stocks I mean there are hot real hot and uh and\nAnd up very quickly also and so for two or three years or or shortly thereafter a you know people buy some money but when it bottomed out in and it ... it really tanked so you had a lot of people that got stuck\nAnd couldn't get out and lost a pot load of money\nMy point is is that the market is up and it is rising and we've gone up in the last couple of years or rather quickly and that only means that when a correction does occur is probably going to fall quickly as well and most people will not have the opportunity to get out before it has fallen\nSignificantly and that's then that's huge if you have an account that the or have a guy who has a thousand accounts there's no way within two or three days that they can get in touch with everybody so you've got to get out and then you have to be able to have a buyer on the other side so it's a complicated process\nNo one has a crystal ball so that's where I hear your philosophy is don't risk more than you can afford to lose right\nThat's correct that you've heard me say that a thousand times\nI Want to go back to what the house okay selling annuities in ... and they had passed complete Senate and all that yet but here's the thing about that if they do they only going to have a few proprietary plans in there you know under whoever's managing\nTheir retirements just fallen case I Do have their product again it goes back to us you won't have one or two options or you want to have hundreds of options\nCome in there and see us we got options at suture and they'd have the products you need to be need guaranteed income you needed more liquid whatever you need we've got a bonus you know he's not ... he's short term and do anything and I won't we have it\nSo please pick up the phone you may have been listening to this show for years or month put it into action pick up the phone even if it's on the weekend leave a message\nFor a gym and his staff at safe harbor financial services and Daphne, Alabama it's a local call at six to five one to two six six to five one to to say toll free if you need it eight seven seven to five one Nineteen eighty four\nSeven

and death from safe harbor financial services and Daphne\nYou know Jim uh we're we're we constantly hear people that are coming in for consultations\nOf the story about you know I've been listening to your radio show for two or three years yes and I'm just now coming in I Wish I Would have come in earlier I should have just made that decision I should not have procrastinated I got complacent\nAnd thought I was doing good and and as good as the market and I realize that I'm not and I finally came in\nNow I mean that is becoming more and more prevalent people will come our seminars are saying the same thing I Can't I came to a seminar\nA year or two ago yeah a looking back I should have started this a year or two ago or can you still helped me the answer is probably yes not in all cases but probably yes and we had a case the other day Gen became in [noise] ah and um\nYou know when they they showed us what we had what they had well actually to the products we're pretty decent products and it would not you know being their best interest to move those products but we told them that said you know\nThe she just got to hang on to or go ahead and start an income uh there's no reason really to move that product um you know we were not going to do that but then they also had a couple of things that that needed to be moved", "year": "2018", "show_name": "INFOMERCIALS: Let's Talk
