but we got we it is a big part of a lot of people's um a lot of people's retirement plan\nSo John when we sit down and talk about the retirement road map the Social Security piece is a big part of that and\nIt's not as simple as saying okay I'll Wait until I'm sixty seven or I'll Wait till I'm Seventy I'll Wait the whole time and then I'll I'll file for Social Security if you're a married person there are things that you need to know about this because there are strategies out their underage really that you can use and and choose from as far as filing\nIs a big part of the of the retirement roadmap we put together we're going to\nHelp you determine and show you when is the optimal time to turn on your Social Security or turn on your spouse is Social Security or turn on both\nOr do we wait to return on one way on the other all of those options like you said there are hundreds of different options for a married couple and they're also a lot of other options for a a widow or widower or a divorce e\nBecause you can tap into a previous spouses benefits then it's just so many different things that are out there so that's when we we we go over that in\nOur first meeting we go into great detail in the second meeting and we show you own your own map exactly when we're going to turn down we show you exactly what your Social Security benefits going to be and what that means over a lifetime life or didn't says we're going to assume that the Social Security benefits going to stay the same even though\nEverybody's getting a three percent raise this year we always count going forward until you're Ninety five years old is going to remain the same as when we turn it on\nYou know you talk about widow benefits or I heard a story and not that long ago of a woman comes to a financial advisor and is it literally\nWas almost destitute and did not know that she could claim on her ex husband and that was the difference between her having an apartment and not having an apartment and so there are things out there that that vital information I mean a Virginia that people need to know\nAnd it's not going to be something that you can go down to the Social Security administration and they are going to run through this with you\nBecause they're there to give you not guidance they're there to give you information and they don't always give you all the information do they\nCrank well they're not going to sit down and ask you um did didn't go through a six or seven page questionnaire about your life to find out what they think is going to be the right choice for here and that's what we do in our first meeting really go through so there are a lot of times we ask a lot of questions like\nYou know how long have you been married and if let's say it's a six year old person or a couple or whatever and they've been married for five years and then we'll have you been married before okay well how long remarried when you are married to for things like that because it's\nYou know they were married to some you know just depending on how they are and how they were when they got married to their second fast you know one um fun fact is that if you uh were divorced and are are divorced and are I'm not sixty five yet a and you get married that\nBenefit of falling on your ex spouse goes away you\nCan't get married before the age of sixty five however if it's after the age of sixty five and you get married and you can file on your ex spouse as long as you're married for ten years benefit because you're out there and you're sixty four and a half and you're thinking about getting remarried and you have an ex spouse that has a good a security benefit you might want to remind\nPeople home out yeah you know that you are a lot of people don't know\nYou know just things\nThat's a simple thing that can really do a lot of money I make a difference yeah so I'm just things like that and then he goes through like you said to his office in there

O. C. N. Daphne, Alabama with your host Mr Jim Byrd hello folks and ... welcome I'm your producer Laurie dubose what's on the agenda today gentleman\nLaurie first we want to talk about the stock market crazy stop marketing they had a record day I Know this type show they had a record day\nA five hundred something going up a ... just yesterday rose yesterday and ah now today is type to show the three hundred and something points down\nBut uh there's an article written by marketwatch magazine and and uh that uh I Wanna rate it says why big one day stock market rebound doesn't mean blue skies ahead and That's William watch writing it for\nA marketwatch magazine and uh the beating down stock market's bounced back sharply but he said is it over with and he says no\nYou know we hadn't hit the bottom yet we go hit bottom in their people call anywhere from ten to thirty percent reduction in the market\nAnd uh but what really gets me is I I was going on line and look at things and I went on Ken fissures and and uh our cars and in their in their blasting index annuities\nBut what they do is they don't tell the whole story of them they only get part of it I Want you to hear in fact she got to remember something each paper salad shop okay a bath one time when ... Fisher headed thank God I hate annuities and all that stuff\nHe checked in with them and try to get that result it took him several days to get the results two thousand eight was down thirty percent one\nIt was over thirty percent Jim and it was like pulling hen's teeth or find out exactly what it was but he was down\nAnd say they have no idea an alternative what they're saying it's getting into bond July and Warren Buffett ... don't buy bonds bond markets terrible right now is not doing anything and you can't make a living you money on bonds you can't stay ahead of taxes inflation if you buy bonds\nLet's go back to bashing annuities and people not knowing the full story that's because there's more than one type of a new era and you only prefer one let's just pretend that people are listening for the first time to this program talk about the different ... and why you favor one over the other\n... um license to sell their they got to be security life and but I don't like ... I think they're very costly and that and without the income writer on them they're they're just as much risk as the marketed\nBut a ... a very ... very comparable but they're not paying enough they're like ... is not paying enough right now to be in them and actually hybrid annuity gifts and made the best of both worlds they give you a a a minimum guarantee and market returns whichever is greater now can Fisher and a half an hour clock I'll tell you that all that pain\nThey knew that they don't pay much of the market returns and all that well you get a ... percent guarantee on the income by it if you're buying hybrid annuity generally you buying it for income K now he says I'll sell the high commission they aren't I'll say I'm the based or commissions but the hack commissions that insurance companies pay does not come out of your money\nYou know gym in the army or just kind of walking through a little bit about the commission structure so you might have a manager all the which they all do and it could be on a scenario could be on an annual basis or or something different combat investment right on the investment side of the house like a ... okay so you get one percent one and a half percent\nOf a manager of the uh let's say on an annual basis\nOkay and it's based on the account value so uh if you're been with them for ten years well you've paid a you know you know roughly ten Fifteen Percent but the problem is is that as the account grows okay\nThen the percentage of the of a larger account you keep paying larger and larger commissions\nAre so that's why he keeps you in their ah that's not the case with a hybrid annuities to or did you and I promote a lot of uh you do have manage money so if people want to go that route you do have that\nAvailable but um you know you pay a lot more commission and manage money than you do in a hybrid ... in fact we also have some a hybrid annuities that or or no cost right no I don't fees and even in the ones that are fees okay\nAre you talking about a commission well the insurance company pays the commission the money does not come out of your account so if you have a hundred thousand dollars\nThat you put it into the account then you start off with a hundred thousand dollars plus all of a bonus in those cases okay so you may start off with a hundred and eight thousand dollars so there are no commissions that are taken out of the value that value gross for you the insurance company pays us when there's a reason behind that is that because we're independent\nAnd it's much more expensive if they want to hire somebody or in and get a thirty six for building and ... you know and give 'em benefits and uh you know have to pay all the legal fees and things like that is much more expensive to do it that way so they prefer business wise and smart business wise to pay us because we have to pay off all of our own bills\nIt's a bit complicated and that's one reason we encourage you to call safe harbor financial services and Daphne, Alabama for a complementary consultation\nThey can sit down with you face to face and explain all of this as well as review\nYour portfolio a pick up the phone even if it's on the weekend and leave a message call safe harbor at six to five one to two six six to five one to two six toll free number is available if you needed a seven seven to five one Nineteen eighty\nFour seven seven to five one Nineteen eighty four if you\nGoogle and make sure you put in safe harbor financial Daphne, Alabama say you know you're getting Jim Byrd and his staff so I have a question\nThat confuses me and we've done this show for six years the the term indexed annuities is a blanket term for the hybrid the variable and the fixed is that right\nOh index annuities is is the old style news that came out ... indexes mark it was supposed to be market returns without risk\nOf the problem is insurance companies didn't give you a lot of the market returns in the old ones you know you can make as much\nThe harbor duty came out with a minimum guarantee or market returns whichever is greater\nNow ... all they don't give you gave me a return I can Shay yeah like change are subject to change just like their products are\nBased on the market you know the bond market but mine thirty six years in his bed as especially the last eleven shouted ... I've seen very little shade and I've seen very little cost increases in them\nUm they also invasion people I gotta say they're ten Fifteen twenty year nobody's we don't have any new and he's more than ten years or ten year nudity is the longest period we have we have some seven years\nOkay we have two years and stuff like that but\nWe have no ... the highest cost I've seen it already noted we sell is less than one percent by ... man that one percent you get a guaranteed lifetime income you cannot live for both you and your spouse\nYou get a bonus eight percent Boehner's or more on you know and as you also get a nursing home number means income double she'd get violent or national it tell me that's not worth that folks an ally argue with him all day long and I am a ...\nAnd he said Oh hi commissions are high commission sales and Beth you're set while ago that commissions don't come out of your money insurance company buys a yes they get it back because and and a ten year period I got surrender chart and you got to hold the product down there but it's not caution you as long as you stay in the ...\nOkay and what do you mean by lifetime income based on what someone puts in their new lady when they reach a certain age they can start drawing that income is that right\nYou can draw it it may leave you want to live but along the way the more it is and it's a percentage of\nOf the money that you get his ... and the older you get the ... of course but you get a guaranteed income for life you cannot outlive even if you run out of money and your spouse gets the same income you're getting\nIn and that income will double ... one of the get confined or in a nursing home help in there that income level so I've had cases watched enough to pay throws you don't need long term care\nBut that's it's a great product of a thing\nJim is the fact that you know if the husband and wife happened to be in an automobile accident oh say and uh both of them pass away I'm In a in a regular pension plan that money goes away mentioned planning just that money\nHere man he admitted that in our you\nKnow I mean you know but we're in our product the beneficiary of his the gets the money which bypasses any kind of probate also\nMentioned that and there's been officially I guess money in there they should they don't compare real\nNo I just categorize them all in one area in and tell the bad points about each one but you got ... they're selling best which are books something they're selling something and they usually has a gimmick and and I think the people that are less than them\nSome of them are going to be making a mistake because when you get down in in outer an age ready to retire or in retirement you need some safe guaranteed income as part of your portfolio and ... and I'm telling you that best my experience I can tell you that you need some guaranteed income and your portfolio\nAnd you need some safety and and ... and Warren Buffett Warren Buffett says don't buy bonds", "year": "2018", "show_name": "INFOMERCIALS: Let's Talk Real Estate wSandy Frost followed by Safe Harbor Investment Show at 10:30", "city": "Mobile", "day": "20"}
