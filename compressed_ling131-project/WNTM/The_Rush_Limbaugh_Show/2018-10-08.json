that conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all [noise] some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so um to see if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it then the question becomes this\nWhen you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by what people are now saying Mr certainly ... the Democrats some of

this\n\nNow folks to show you how deranged this is I have and the stack today I have a two maybe three what I Would call teachable moment things they are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both\nToday and over the weekend they are related to cap and all but they\nThe pieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and of course for the for the Democrats and much of it is I mean I just so dead wrong in the simple\nRecitation of the facts of all this if it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them they continue to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left\nOne of them is or isn't John Harris\nAt Politico one of the founders Democrats fear of there are a wet rag party you know what this piece was about this piece was about how the Democrats get their rear end headed to them every time because all the Democrats are a bunch of cowards the Democrats have no ...\nThe Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers and Democrats and Republicans walk all over\nNow how many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side as a bunch of war says but I don't\nKnow how anybody paying attention on the left can think that their sights a bunch of ... but the fact that they do is fascinating to me\nNow here's another such pace and we have said that this woman once before I don't remember specifically when her name is Alexis Grinnell she has written on gender and politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets\n[noise] she had a piece\nOn Saturday in New York Times it may have been actually published on Sunday and released on the Web on Saturday Night the dates October sex since I don't read the paper anymore I don't know when this stuff actually shows up in the print edition\nSo my guess is this thing was released

as a ... by the Democratic party got that has become the Democratic party I firmly believe and I said this Friday\nAnd even if it makes me sound naive I'm going to say it again in a same world\nIn a decent and just country the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democratic party's lifetime\nThere is\nNot a single thing in a decent then just country that the American left at the Democratic party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants a stamp of approval of winning elections\nYet they win them within their closely contained bases district and states their enclaves which is actually a very small portion of this country in terms of square mileage\nPopulation centers of the big cities on the coasts and then the great lakes\nHere's the\nIt's not a dirty little secret but at some things don't always keep in mind\nAnd frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program and the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal democratic presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts as they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges who rule of law\nAnd there is a dirty little secret behind this folks\n\nThe Democrats simply do not have\nThe numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not have the numbers\nTo implement and pass their agenda legislatively otherwise they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as laws in America\nThey have to rely on activists job just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or Jews or ... before no nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its its relevance its power and it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin I'll Fight and explains in one reason\nWhy why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land\nThere on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that that was forced\nOn the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court and any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure\nThat the left so despise isn't so hates that they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively\nThey need activist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every that this is the point\nWhat they believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nObama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years\nIf a bomb had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you renting it he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be they routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of a Alexander ...\nWho's lunacy on display in a leftist district to New York is harmless\nBut you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and massage sticking all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability\nTo to win any of these issues legislatively are you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this every thing they want everything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced\nOn the country the country has been bludgeon the into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they show you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things legislatively\nAnd yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this giant ... blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when bang and even the Republicans think so\nA P has them Reuters has some New York times CNN doesn't matter where you go there's always going to be a story where Republicans in Green Bay it's over the Republicans\nDeathly afraid Republican scared to death no way they can resist that coming blue wave\nSorry don't buy it\nMay happen I don't buy it\nI don't trust anything I say on the news anymore and I certainly don't trust the bunch of polling data\nGiven what\nFallacies existed in both the news and polling leading up to thousands sixteen\nHere is a story\nOf a website called the Babylon and be a Democrats shutter an idea of having to legislate through Congress should Supreme Court lean right\n\n[noise] I don't know if this site is legitimate or not or if it's if it's a hoax site what they're doing a satire on the truth because it absolutely is the case they are ...\n\nOf of capital a capital of being on the court simply because of the shift in the courts that it represents\n\nBuddies undeniable folks it's factual it's right in front of us they have not been able\nTo succeed\nImplementing the leftist socialist communist agenda via the United States Congress they can do it in their state legislatures I give you some places like California and so forth they haven't been able to do it nationwide it has to be forced\nAnd of course for that to work for the use of force to be working half the cave to it\nYou after it came to the bullying which has happened on gay marriage it's happened on transgender bathroom issues it's happened not every oddball leftist cultural demand out there they count on everybody caving they count on everybody's suing for peace until Donald Trump came along\nThe way they framed him with the media is something they're going to use later on to find the entire Supreme Court\nWhen they don't get their way bingo\nThat's already been done the de legitimize position of the Supreme Court has already been gone why none other than the woman that hired Kagan sorry that's her name the woman has hired capital to teach at Harvard\n... who was the

devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life a private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or it I think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products more power can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed\nAnd then in fact this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported Kavanaugh and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kavanaugh\nIs that they were ... it it is scared to death at what they saw being set\nUp against\nMen they have sons they have brothers and anybody with half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind to see that the Democratic party had a line the itself in such a way\nThat men were often don't meant that lake guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable\nIn fact [noise]\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point made the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is in as a woman making the point that\nKevin Whitelaw is as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because\nHe has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe lousy forward that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this\nYou wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there's no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened\nIt they just change tactics and the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine ball before they had a two for that someone that not only educate our youth\nThat someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for oh I just think that this is the new battlefront and ah thankfully we tromp through cannot has put some ... on the final Republicans\nA ... true true but maybe I'm maybe I'm Still waiting for trying to force in this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since\nYou have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just the we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior\nWhich was widely publicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros under these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people down to the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down\nDo you think the American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or\nDo you think the American public doesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue color class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely the American people are going to be turned off\nAnd I I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get a get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty let me okay this is my ... I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king a book titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this month just column for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans aren't not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case\nDemocrats think they are going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country is except they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that\nThey're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout\nIs and they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people can be reading Republicans don't have a chance\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the event had happened and what twenty nine days but it it happened\nA true yeah when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right\nAnd there are some people saying that this is going to be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox say a lot of learning pungent commentators oh God I was going to be so old white and actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yeah I'd just as a chuckle\nUm\nSo I can I can see what the passage just be you cannot maintain\nThis river passion for long nobody can\nWelded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm ...
