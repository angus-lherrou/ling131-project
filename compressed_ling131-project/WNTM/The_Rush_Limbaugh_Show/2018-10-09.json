Hillary Trump is a Russian storage Trump has money because the Russians sought to what Trump owns Russia because of that Trump therefore soft on Russia\nNow Nikki Haley is leaving and that means nobody's left to be tough on Russia and our allies are scared to death as a total one hundred percent front to back top to bottom crock folks\nGuarantee our allies are probably happiness he Nikki

that exist in the country specifically by explaining just who the left is what they've become what we're up against\nA to me it is the seminal issue that we all face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it I mean America is always going to be here don't misunderstand but this country surviving as founded we're under a solved it has never been worse\nI'm

don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural up to the most and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that we face are still that's coming up as the program unfolds back however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president\nFirst off apologizing to the nation\n... Kavanaugh on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him and they have an episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against\nAnd it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas\nThe left is not interested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments over the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have\nNo limit on how low they will go on how to praise saved and perverted they will be in seeking their reality it all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean do you go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think was the best way to get people's attention with it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nOr and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't do it so the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this and I thought [noise]\nBut they don't for folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\nIdeas are not legitimate our exist\nAnd it's not legitimate and not even worthy of discussion or acknowledge\n\nAnd they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as they're concerned and it was all\nOn display in the capital hearings everything that we are up against the abs and some presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence Kavanaugh was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely non just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nAnd that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court the rest of it the history on it [noise] the child like wailing

looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop it\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but\nWe have to temper that with the reality is is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of

all of this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\n\nAnd do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acted on concerned on interest in and would always say a variation of you\nCan't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nHe's Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not saying it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\n\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they could be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to eat well Amy that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies there her book signing ceremonies\nHillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some ain't coming out the proper up by the albums\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death while they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but\nThey're human beings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believe you an upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got to be able\nTo show the
