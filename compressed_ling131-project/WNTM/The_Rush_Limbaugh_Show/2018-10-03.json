B. I. special agent her best friend for life\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a lie detector test in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean issued a statement\nTo ABC I have never had an Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime\nI ... I think they've been caught big time and I Rachel Mitchell if I have time I I've just got enough data on this right before the program began I didn't have time\nTo assemble it but the questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr Ford just so many lives that if it ever came became necessary to use them she can be destroyed a credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody's going to try to get past this\nOr through this without any any challenging or Dr Ford because she's a eliciting such sympathy and one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech patterns I look\nI'm a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist\nVocal work a\nVoice capabilities voice talents [laughter] excuse me again art that I may have gotten it out there that time we'll see are especially of mine\nI recognize speech patterns I Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this\nWhile a voice actress in Hollywood\nDecided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter universe came down on this woman on mercilessly\nSo we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her or at least here\nFrom any further assaults taking place but here is what she posted and it is so spot on\n... anybody personal ... ... ... ... ...\nThat's how I found an hour at a psychiatrist he even knew\nAll talk about an attack on a crowd and rhyme and I found I found ... to curb any [noise] ... how\nTo pass a law that her as far as ... even now I'm back to [noise] ... [noise] yes that's correct or ... ... ... ... ... ... [noise]\nHe can write that and [noise] like how many [noise] Atlanta I'm In town about their privacy by ...\nAnd ... that that speech pattern what does it make you think you're dealing with a child here the elite up talking at the end of every sentence that fits vulnerability\n... is its fragility almost in a way\nOr maybe even somebody nervous and traumatized and scared\nAnd that is exactly the a\nPersonality that I think she wanted to do affect and she succeeded with it\nAnd it's because of that but I think I don't no matter what his learned about her and how much she has lived if you will a which again Rachel Mitchell has\nIf necessary [laughter] could\nBlow this woman out of a water that's what I had no one else has put this together by the way that I've seen I've just in random show prep Reno a story here story there are noticing things\n\nWill be a little reference to what Rachel Mitchell asked her about subject a and her answer and then you read another story and there's one more reference to Rachel but you can put all these together\nAnd it it\nIt's almost as though Rachel Mitchell knew going in that she knew a lot more about balls the Ford than anybody has eluded to she knew about Monica McLean she knew about the polygraph why she asked him this\nWhy why are you this is not what this says about Canada why aren't you asking her details chicken farm about her story instead this prosecutor was asking all about seemingly unrelated or not really important things\n\nSo we will just have to say again Monica McLean retired FBI and this by the way brings up or conjures up\nFBI\nFord has a best friend in the FBI who read ... resigned retired in two thousand sixteen a wonder how many people working on the Trump case that the FBI trying to establish collusion that Dr Ford and ... McLean no matter what kind of a possible connection here is there maybe\nSo it's it's it's I'm fascinated as is the letter from the from the ex boyfriend\nAnd the primary reason the ex boyfriend says he broke up with her is how she lied about using his credit card he took her name off the credit card when they broke up and she can tend to use that she ... about six hundred bucks on\nA\nBoard was asked directly in the hearing if she had given tips on how to pass a polygraph she said\nNever never\nRachel ... have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test never remember when the question was asked I Do think what the hell was this\nNow Senator Grassley has been busy refuting claims made by ... and the other's Grassley is on fire by the way Grassley is doing such a bang up job as is his staff here\nUh\nAnd you know their whole commitment is to do quality work\nAt a fair price the unvarnished reviews proven in fact they're proud of their reviews and put them up online bachelor service dot com certification number one Seventy Seventy\n... radio fantasy sports news updates\nFor major league baseball and Colorado will be the\nMessages that are we talking the rules are returning to listen to Nick and Vicki story about the quiet during last Harry loud and very\nNaturally to rape me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever with age list male max patent pending formula within a greedy that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases and muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric\nOxide ones move on from the wild card game but it's a Thirteen any use of ... thing with the mountain thirteenth put their losses and Jim are you there came on at the end of the Dodgers on Thursday his race will be on five days wrestling Herschel will start game number two on friday\nFor the never came on board the breeze against the Dodgers Yankees Louis Severino their daughter for Wednesday's AOL wild card game you can leave Hendra full service the athletic over here and when they gave\nThe twins officially let them out or go to Japanese they hand expert who's ... hours right some determining the health field there will not eat off the surgery in the NFL Robert ... he was asking for Tuesday's practice the patriots everyone in this across will be just fine but there's a nice game it gets sold\nOn ... radio network news updates\nFantasy sports radio network keyword fantasy on your eye heart radio out\nNow doubled un GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen I ever won there's still no sign of summer letting go we're going to go with temperatures around Ninety this afternoon which puts us within two degrees of a record\nHigh partly cloudy skies and only one or two thunderstorms popping this afternoon clear tonight and Seventy one it's mostly sunny on Thursday with a high of Ninety One that's all so close to a record\nAnd will do it again on ... just Jake done from NBC Fifteen for this I heart radio station\nFrom the moon audiologist hearing center mobiles duty over till it's making a world here ... this is news radio seven ten W.

have you ever hear Rush Limbaugh doing you know what I was born\nTo do [noise]\nHosting the most listen to radio talk show in the country there's a big get [laughter]\nLack of a reveal in the New York times tax story on Trump\n\nThe New York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where am I got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody at the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has on that that but they've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we got Trump Arabic claim he's mocking multi party wasn't mocking or what I understand Republican senators saying\nWhat they're saying oh my God this is only acceptable I don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason everybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he set it\nTo everybody has to\nBefore all this is um investigated and put your but you can't run out there and start ripping on her\nEven if it's desert even if it's warranted last week it could not rip on Christine ... there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate all last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus I find a compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed out all Trump did is playing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nThe hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there they were not going\nThe challenger because it just wasn't smart\nEspecially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhat an I'd been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing\nCommittee hearing her allegations would be challenged in tested they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the lies or the difference is the ... she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all he did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's Kevin I'm covered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rent them for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step in it\nIt may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me is this one year the New York times has been investigating that Trump's for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one\nWord you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess what I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I gave you hit\nIt was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for bats yet they want to Trump's\nTax returns because their tax returns they said would prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced\nWas true and now here's the New York times story year long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was a potent storage\nTrump wasn't totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents for the first thing they did\nWas make a B Line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russian Russia names answer big fat zilch zero is not a sudden now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump and he got rich from his dad\nActually or whatever or something somebody J. R. O. things mostly are too young to remember\nBottom line and I know what had happened to a woman for political environment\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people as audiences don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all John's\nEh you never know what you're going to do when you're grabbing got about ... what you want to come up against what you're gonna you're gonna come up but you know women like New Hampshire aren't ready to\nQuit and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroying those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript an anti Kavanaugh protester with confronted I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back\nHe asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're gonna you're gonna believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it or best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you write that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCast that you know no would you like and on corroborate would charge destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk so the protestor\nOh no wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up Cassidy you know it's unfair protester I Would fight and I would make sure women heard clearly you're okay for rapist goes on his uh\nCourt Cassie no not but then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protested no there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what does this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young Web behind me years naive and the media would want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taken off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that not at all they were curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubt it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happened\nThat somebody has to have to say it\nShould probably be met for\nMeals Rush Limbaugh\n...

explained this before and I'm going to explain it again\nTrump all ways\nEventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything\nAnd he may not do that out of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's\nWhy I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there have been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill treat something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... the ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at it than moving\nTo the rights oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes up tells you what do you think's\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped\nDeveloped I don't even open developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans having Trump has Trump has a stab wished\nThat after he makes that initial statement on something that he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how blindly insane\nIt has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night\nI Know Murkowski and Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible we thought was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress\nVideo audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just simply pushy she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any ... for what she said why\nIs that not relevant why does that not matter why\nHave we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can join ... can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine a man organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine it can you\nCan't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me to\n\n... or ... women are nor do there should we do well yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this\nIt's about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women and they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political move but I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off for the first ten minutes and I've been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his wife ... could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very\nNow's the time of year

James of\nThe gym and guarantee quote from a National Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics and all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for bad description for years I have no problem admitting\nThat I was unable to put this together is one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or The Revenge is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it that's what the\n... this this um [noise] well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter or to take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singing\nIt causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure of the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether\nBoys\nWant to pretend to be girl so they can go into girls' bathrooms\nAnd becomes legitimate\nSick it ... it in in many it's not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop is a rate every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination in racism all of this the\nDemocratic Party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends it only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally it doesn't even depend on\nBeing fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders the White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply resign did the fact\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened\nIn public they had ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim off record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocked she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine balls before\nOf attacks from Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the birds we shouldn't have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they bowed miserable you think the president maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was fading facts that were given during Dr ... testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not face the judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold a position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenger so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... adds to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing the little shade for some of these people to hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done a Dutch outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed grade to speak to you again a right to have your back yeah\nIt's great to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the cabinet firings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's been to a girl but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them who are coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while you are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me to\nGet away ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman\nI Believe she thinks she was right when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it\nBut it's relevant cats roamed McKenna and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I Wish it could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's\nBeen taught and heard on the news and talking to her but she made all literally believe that memory I have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nIt goes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr do you\nEver um uh you're right sex without consequences it but you better not\nBut then they claim that all men are predators but then they run to run hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine you know kind of a better right by the way here's this ... you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include women women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement against their will it's just that assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media\nOr making I think I Am from your young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written

is an element of that whole movement or that\nWhole desire the Democrat Party is in on it they are as much a part of the deep state as the F.
