somebody really really good at making bombs hates the left this much\nDoes he think this is going to help Republicans in the mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise]\nUm I actually think all candor that what's going on barring a the revelation of what really this is about if we ever learn that I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative and you've watched everything\nBlow up on your your watch cabinet blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you if all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports in at restaurants at all that's blowing\nUp on you and it is by the way it's not working what could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass and threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing\nThat really makes any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system and what's so much apparent hatred for Trump when Republicans\nThat other people joined up or people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans do other words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt to spreading hate\nAnd anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got is we hate Trump Trump sucks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment\nThat's all they've got and so if none of that work if all of that backfired and leave me and has\nEspecially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of words that has backfired on them like you cannot believe\n[noise] so what would you do you might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side\nYou might want to do something to make it look likely in saying lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact of lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis them in terms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website but many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is\nAverage all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and co founder of this place\nWas on a C Fox Business network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point Mimi it'd be building we'd we'd be seeing the top of it here\nAnd Tom ... all the polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't\n\nBut on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project I pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sleep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple to Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump gender gap\nEducation gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past week cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise]\nAnd Trump is a great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another retired historian and political analyst\nSent an email that I received a lawsuit but I've been able to have it it was just this morning and I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them but I just want to share with your some of the things I get some of the is by the way legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me\nA into promoting whatever it is that since I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you this passionately\nThis guy who is it a story and who has studied the American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone just not as well known as he looks at things\nHe usually is an absolute red wave and he did not believe this until last night he's been seeing trends in the past two weeks but he has been reluctant to convert into these trends into an actual prediction until now\nHolds couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct\nSo they still have that reputation as all of a sudden\nIt could be really really close much

George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq who said oh\nYou don't get that information is not out there for the masses to obtain now quite being there was never any attempt for these devices to make their way through their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers at certain D. but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't stoop to everything from they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something that's whoa it tell\nGoing along all along those lines if you want to look at it that way it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning leaves elections just makes no sense to do\nThis was going to be\nInstant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around one\nIt make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this\nThis is not going the way they have a short us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember they believe their posters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around and you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and and you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state and this is right on\nThe play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama the uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOh yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to ...\nYeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWill tell people what it was ... tell me because I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ...\nUm there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign in ... thousand eight with signs saying iron my shirts or you're in my shirt of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and you watch or we're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts been fixed dinner and get my slippers that kind of thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant in it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy in\nSeparate it was Hillary plan to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on it keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good piece and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons at great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidence is and there are no ah are you there is nothing that set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made up\nAnd so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami for someone who is quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody was open the door for her while she shouted that I Believe that's a set up I don't want to sound like a conspiracy care steer but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense\nAnd I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good teacher here see the ... I could never let a good crisis\nGo exactly rush no no you're you're ... you're right about the Clintons there are no coincidence is with them this is a this is a philosophy that I have a stalled for four years on this program asking people to\nNever forget there are no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that Israel deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm if\nIt is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to it other than they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons\nDesperately need to be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some Gloria trying to show everybody he can still move the needle isn't working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirt I used\nTo the rush to excellent store open up some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us and she said you know I could never say this outside this elevator but\nI I have for everything you've done to my family I Can't help but I find you the most compelling most interesting guy that I haven't\nRun across I wanted to meet you for I don't know how long because you're in a kind of guy you know I Am a ...

running investigation into corruption in Tallahassee\nNo one's been charged with anything and Gillum has said that agents assured him he was neither a target and or a focus of the probe just like call

census and give them just hands essay multiple you pay for the Hamilton take it's not\nA lot of people want is a big deal okay a trip to New York Hamilton tickets big\nGuy won't tell the truth about it is the big ... up\nBut I think this is chump change compared to what's really at stake here I I think it chump change is wrong because it is a window into he'll Gillum is and he is somebody that wants to parlay his positions of power\nIn too positive influential goodies for himself\nHe is a classic a politician in that regard who believes the holding high office equals an entitlement to perks and ah and other things is willingly a desirous of seeking them\nAnd it's a [noise] in in this in this era where everybody feels the need to denounce the special interest and not being beholden to them a Gillum can't make that statement now let's look at the polling data Quinnipiac University poll yesterday\nShowed that Andrew Gillum is headed ... fifty two to forty six among the light ... voters\nAnd he has a double digit lead among women Hispanics and independence and it's the third such poll in about a week ten days just show Gillum\nWith this clear to lead as is overall edge in public polling why do its largest level since October first [noise]\nOkay so Gillum is a character he is a person with cloud of suspicion\nThat are hanging all over him in addition to that he is a hard left wing activist tack who refers to Florida as his collective he looks at things in the white communists and Marxist do\nHe does not believe in the power of the individual because that leaves the inequality and unfairness\n\nHe wants everybody to get free health care here and a free medical care over their Medicare for all he believes in a guarantee of national income these these kinds of things that\nIf ever implemented would bring to a screeching halt in Florida everything that's happening nationwide that is building the economy but who is this ant is a lot of people may not know much about Ron's Santas\nSo let me step in here and tell those of you in this vast and wide audience in Florida who he is\nRhonda saying this is a Yale and Harvard graduate who was a decorated jag officer in the navy judge advocate general\nHe has a solid record of winning achievements as a representative from Florida he has resigned his house seat\nIn order to devote all of his time exclusively to his campaign has got a great family his wife ah is is all in for this has got a young kid is just the\nEpitome of a decent solid American citizen who has achieved tremendous great things\n\nNow on TV I think you have us this morning he was on on Fox and he very calmly and very simply outlined a pattern or corruption by Andrew Gillum\nHe pointed out the FBI as had yellow monitor radar for years as they said an undercover agents to catch him for breaking all kinds of laws and accepting bribes in return for development deals pay to play so to speak\n\n... graduated from college was given awards by socialist organizations which propelled him a young age to get elected to the city commission in Tallahassee then he became mayor for three years he's been under some kind of clout or investigation ever since he wants to Florida to be a sanctuary state\nHe wants to Florida to be open borders for any and all illegal immigrants he is the classic\nAmerican socialist who believes that America is the problem in the world and the poverty in Central America and the southern hemisphere is our fault\nBecause we have a hog than stolen too many and too much of the world's resources and we imported at all and we have denied it to our neighbors\nWilliam stolen America from the Native Americans and so forth there's nothing decent about the American founding the constitution is all out David now and the guy is a classic throwback he is\nA ... walking talking Iraq Hussein Obama on steroids if that's even possible\n\nIf you compare the current crop of Democrats can get Andrew Gillum is not unusual among the dead the Democrats are putting people like him up all over this country\nAnd in many places they're biting the blame you heard what's happening to Heidi Heitkamp did you hear what she did\nShe just [noise]\nTell you in a minute as time unfolds here she is down third team in her Senate race she voted against Kavanaugh and then thought she'd be able to recover\nSome
