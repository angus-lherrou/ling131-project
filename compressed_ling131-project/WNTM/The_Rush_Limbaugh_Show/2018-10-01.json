world that Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it was we're\nMade to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and that she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written in the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public\nSo people were trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have taught her for a busy you most a note ringer\nIt's fair it's sort of spotlight and it\nObvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of law\nAnd her one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff the other would have to be\nA somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine balls e for a new and seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and I was all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually asked for point of order\nThe chairman Grassley and and send a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrageous allegations that I or my staff had lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my

it\nMr German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy saying oh is this how we're going to determine who leaked something she gets to turn to her staff and ask them and they deny it and that's it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and ask to undergo his seven FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did an interview late this letter and nice loan nor nor was it was with us\nShe turns back around so we we didn't do it unless the German as though case closed it wasn't us they had done it it was strategic just like what happened on friday was statistic strategic\nLadies and gentlemen I

he will take any findings into consideration for the new FBI probe Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh also insisting he's not limiting the scope of the review just deferring to the Senate\nThere's even a little story this developed about the uh her use of safe way\nThat she shopped in safe way a lot and that was new and the reason this the theory behind that is\nMark judge wrote a book as part of his therapy for alcohol and drug abuse he was told to write a book\nIt was it was supposed to be a fictional book it was a it was a it was an aide to attempt to help him through his\nProblems it was not a memoir\nAnd in this book it talks about safe way a lot and he works there didn't work there so she automatically places herself at a Safeway where he is\nRachel Mitchell found this highly suspicious and like much else that she said impossible to prove\n\nHer report I mean I printed it out it's like six pages here I I it it is devastating be inconsistencies in her stories the variables in her story\nThe fact that none of the stuff that matters can be proven the fact that the people she said in the room the number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the\nTestimony she had the idea that she was afraid to fly and yet\nHere she is vacationing all over the world how did she get there the idea that she refused to talk to the committee even in California we learn that she didn't even know the committee had offered to fly out there because of the lawyers didn't tell her\nBy the way a couple of Republicans and not demanding an investigation Tom Cotton says we're gonna investigate Feinstein we're going to investigate this leak and we're going to investigate these lawyers who may not have told her to the committee was willing to go out there because they believe that she was afraid to fly none of this was true\n\nSo I ... the idea that she's ... she is the last\n\nShe's not the least credible witness in all of this and yet there she is automatically\n\nSaid to be credible every leftist\nSupposedly reviewing her performance I found or her credible\nBased on what she was in such pain she was so so shaken by what happened all\nThose years ago you can say yeah because she really knew how to make it look like that\nI don't think\nFor me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus groups I think it's scripted\n\nAnd I just I'm because none of this past is any kind of a smell test well anyway back to mark pencil\nVery quickly\nAmericans believe her and both believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed\nAccording to a weekend harbored Harris Poll of the thousand three hundred and thirty registered voters sixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independents with only forty five percent\nRepublicans who are in a smart ones\n\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent thought Kevin all was twenty seven percent said both ... if you combine all that the poll findings indicates sixty seven percent found her credible and fifty percent found him to be\nWhat the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to cooperation as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should've summed up the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent say rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the voters are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships from forty four percent and fifty seven percent in favor confirmation meaning\nMeaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jumped from forty to fifty seven percent and then up to sixty percent\nIn a hypothetical question if the FBI after a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that\nBut now we've got a call me entering the picture now we've got a call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI had been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add

attacking Kevin uh they're basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base we\nShowed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm part of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last June twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're gonna have to show up in midterms are going to they're going to have an adverse effect that they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I uh uh he he he Jason here thinks that all of this is gonna backfire on the Democrats and motivate Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again for Trump and twenty\nTwenty or let's go to the audio soundbites on this Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing friends weekend\nOn Saturday morning Rachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts is talking to CBS in political corresponded David Brody about all this\nAnd she says well we know the Democrats all ready men really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized naked get\nBut I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp or my reporting and found that the coral evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's going to be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up at the horrible evangelical base in the jail the base I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so\nI think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow like you you can't blame\nDavid Broder you for being fifty percent of informed because\nI I pulled back that original prediction after we'd had gone viral all over the drive by media that's why it's still prominence\nPeople's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican do\nThey can't help themselves they got to put her all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh says\nRepublicans are guaranteed to lose ... capital not confirmed that production was\nBased at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nRepublicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just went bird out\nI predicted that won't happen but once this began to unfold I retracted that production and said it could end up being the opposite here but\nOf course that production didn't go viral and I want to Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more a bite on this is a CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard\nAndrew anger about me\nThere's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get out of 'em all prefer to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not have it

could be I mean the but the point was uh I didn't have anything specific in mind it's just that we got a poll in June or appalling mayor even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this whole doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the pole in July of two thousand sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything because it's not when the election is and I said the\nThe the events are going to shape the midterms haven't happened yet I said that in July August September\nA and this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind but there's going to be something beyond this\nOh dear this is going to get resolved\nOne way or the other depending on how it's resolved yeah it's going to affect turnout it's going to affect votes\nIf the Democrats lose this uh if Kavanaugh gets confirmed a\nThan what a democratic voters going to do they get us going to be really enraged didn't show up and vote are they going to be

delayed delayed\nBy my only point was that those polls in the summer are largely irrelevant because there are things are going to happen much closer to the election nobody can predict that are going

we don't even know if the people calling him or not Democrat activists to begin with just to create the phone traffic\nMike intention to you is that the me too movement alone\nHas no doubt inspired a lot of women to courageously step up and accused guys that have mistreated them it's not a new phenomenon it's not something\nFor which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is it the tail end of this new awareness insensitivity\nAnd yet\nIt's being spoken of Christine mostly for his testimony on her inspiration is being spoken of as though it's a stand alone and it's never\nHappened before and that adds to her credibility though don't you see\nAnd I think we're all being played oh yeah I Do know I'm not accusing\nI'm not saying women are coming forward I'm saying it's not a new thing

with more information is not the question why do we need to give the Democrats more time to make up a bunch of other information ought to be the suspicion here okay so the Trump soundbites\nThese are from the oval office was during a\nAn announcement ceremony for a new trade deal eliminates the NAFTA getting rid of it brand new trade deal\nThe drive by eyes were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we had one through four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin on things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression poles of polls that are on very accurate we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome\nBut you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election [noise] they were telling me I was getting in trouble in certain states that ended up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondents said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is it\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what I'd change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's not a bad statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now the sevens investigation so it's not like the you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me ... let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay\n[noise] ...\nThis whole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nThat's how the committee vote in Lebanon to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flight was not going to vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation till the FBI had spent at least a lot of weight walking into this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI ice go because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump who's had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI and it's been doing his best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything\nI've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at\nOh OK thank you Mr herself it needs to go two weeks ago two weeks so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out\nHe's not limiting the scope NBC's why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow but then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on\nIt will just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on until friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be rigged and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was read\nThey're gonna do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels say to which the response is well they found nothing you know hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nUh let's see let's let's skip forward here to um [noise]\nAudio soundbite number thirty reporter about judge Kavanaugh there are concerns\nThat might have lied or mischaracterized as drinking while he was testifying if they find that Kavanaugh lied about his drinking or if he lied about other things do you think that

clicked on the lake here's what it is [noise]\nRight here at my formerly nicotine saving fingers in New York Times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview any one necessary for Kevin on inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said at his press conference today where he's\nNo I don't want to limit anything I said guys don't do this that they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigation central I'm not that's fake\nNews so then they've got a record Trump not limiting invested ... which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting it everywhere White House tells me I interview when he wasn't necessarily and rice on schedule C.\nAnd and reports that the Democrats have submitted a list

cannot go on all this is\nIs delayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nHas somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides that needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with a woman who doesn't remember where or when what ever happened to her happen\nAnd there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promote it\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be
