base\nAnd I mean that specifically I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W.

callers had to pay money to be on hold yeah yeah yeah I Do remember that way and I are way back then I ... back you go I\nI've been way back before that even fell a but hey I've got a theory about this caravan\nThe last two years there's only one thing that the Democrats have won on and that's the wall and it as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income Trump is caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that for this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nAh that that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump\nDoes not have the wall can't get a phone call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon Trump do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as that as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these uh one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it burns me up\nAt all the time so are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNow I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe you know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that he wants to do their\nNext year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... all I can say these are smarter than than I Am\nA navy but but I uh [noise]\nThey they seem to your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to and for for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding his own with\nFour thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate the Trump hasn't built the wall Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective those people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nOh I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well\nBut my question is what else did they got\nWell they've got ... behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised and that's the that's the uh well that's exactly\nRight and wound right there that was four in the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want if not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even start so it really aggravates me personally\nBut this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution that leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all up you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget the ... we've had continuing resolutions\nUm we Democrats can't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and I'm like before you go to I don't want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that\nLeaders in both parties do not want that ball\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\n[laughter] they they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things they didn't want that he's he's a he's come through and he's twisted them a into doing what he wants\nOut many of them are in the ... I think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea\nThat Trump was going to be a garner a before now I I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the meaning of targets\nI I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on

I can defend the pictures rushed the pictures\nSo that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio sound as if you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming to you ill quick oh this is the sound bite the hand of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine outcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans or Democrats really blew that\nBut there are four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the\nIt hasn't been the right consistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectivity is like this process if I put on the spot production\nBut we hold the house and we increase the Senate because I think that's just I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel the day our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer uh Anton ... Julie ... out there talking to fame Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins about my combat\nThan deserve to lose like he's bar act on that front half right on the other front I think will lead some Senate cities I think the house was very very much in jeopardy\nSo you are not buying into his or her syndicated article hold it Rush Limbaugh said they ... they don't count votes like I Do I mean I run a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seat there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats ... totally on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break you\nLet me run through them and say this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff\nAnd to me this is totally abs and are there any any what what's the word personality or I mean there's just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling\nAnd I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just like I said in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion\nAnd their desired outcome out of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty and I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win it Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve and the midterms in ...\nI was in fourteen ... election as your thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama's there that could be a factor Obama's gone\nSo maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there as I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years\nTo make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rush the Senate yeah we're probably pick up look up the house is gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar well not true if these races are being nationalized by the various\nCandidates in them [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden\nStop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that many people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage an anger there promoting insanity and the lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump\nIs there's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump\nSentiment in a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats\nSay that the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy\nWas his well that went on for like a lead the balloon and they died with it so they abandoned map\nAnd outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey haven't dad continued\nTo try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where\nIs this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on ballots Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAmongst known calling so that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think this is coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the Saturday\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the predominant ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voted to the shy breakfast votes as a kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve sheltered and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a\nReason why what was Limbaugh getting this I mean there's not a single pulled out of the shows this happening precisely my\nPoint it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by\nTheir gospel and I really think um if I Lived in\nWashington each and every I don't\nI couldn't I I wouldn't it be\nOstracized after not too long I just couldn't get with the program living there I have known that for for many many moons\nJeez [noise] this\nSadly clueless uh and and pro

I work a lot of hours and I'm and I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make make this country work\nYou know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see it\nWell small business small but there's no question that small business is uh the vast majority of of employment in the country and some could say the backbone\nWell okay I I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not\nThat week and I'm not I don't have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism for anyone and not take it personally so don't\nEver fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George thinking this is Lloyd in in in\n... lost in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi\nHow're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was an Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell ... yeah but there's not a Britain it's been all aimed at stopping anybody from crossing is the point is his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it I remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump is a phony is not who he says he is and they want to distance Trump's voters from him and that's all the callers theory was\nHow I don't think that could happen these done too much into little time\nNo I don't either get either leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan\nIs uh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions if we had independent budget deals if we had and then there's not and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it\n", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Mobile", "day": "19"}
