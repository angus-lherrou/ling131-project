{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "The gym I just want to read quickly a I'm a something that Warren Buffett says it's a quote from him and says don't risk money you need to live on versus money you desire to have in retirement [noise] now I guess you must be listened to the radio\nBecause what do you say don't risk what you can't afford\nTo lose this right and we also say bonds are bad right now and it was warm bucks I get out to buy that is correct yes say by ... ... ... bond you and your fellow right now lives are not good investment so\nWhich brings me to the point that I talk about quite frequently is that there's an old rule which is still rule and and and the investment world today and that's if you're in your twenties thirties and forties\nOr you have let's say Seventy percent of your money and inequities okay because they're more risky and you have time to make it up should you have a two thousand eight or as you move into the retirement age which is mid fifties\nA then that starts to flip flop and you wind up having Seventy percent and it used to be bonds okay and thirty only thirty percent and growth issues and in the equity markets\nTrade that rule hasn't changed the part of it this change gym is that the the bonds and the bond funds are not a great place to be right now and so we have other vehicles to do so much better\nAnd actually have less risk than those bonds\nAnd some have no risk\nThey're looking at ATF Sarkozy yes uh-huh basically what we've done in a but we have that in our manage money portfolio so if you want some risk\nWe ask you what how much you willing to risk one of the questions we asked you know what would bother you you know if you lost it and so we have managed money for those that want to stay in Iran but most of our products are completely risk free\nA summer more liquid and others but one for the guaranteed income you don't need liquidity that's to put aside for income later if you need liquidity we got manage money we got a uh\nOther products that have a red liquid now at no cost to them I mean that's a great life insurance and we have a life insurance which I've gone to get into is that a lot of times people come in and they want to make sure they leave their kids money\nHe don't want the best way to do that to single frame of mind if you put a sum of money in there and you're going to get a tremendous life insurance\nA vehicle with it but you also got the money liquid is Arnie index marketing earning a good interest right ... and you got long term care included in that product based on the amount of life insurance you die and it's ... it's a lot easier to get their standard life insurance\nAnd is it easy to withdraw I mean it's like when\nYou ask very liquid completely liquid fuel into personal gain date\nIn it so you get it out are starting to all the answers shouted may leave you want to\nI mean is banned unique product but it in his space simplified under ice a phone call no fiscal involving like that so some money you got sitting around a bank or something you're not you know you don't want to do with that you just got it there but Marcy you could put it in here or\nIt or if you have a a an older uh a life insurance policy because a lot of those are are are very good anymore and so we can take those policies and move them into the uh the the ones that you just got finished talking about which offers many more tools and many more things yeah you\nMay have gotten a notice that your policy has matured if you want to try new it's it's a crazy amount and now it's gone out oh\nYeah we right Adam ... well actually we had a guy in their gym that was working for a company to company provided some term insurance for him and he was paying I think a twenty or thirty dollars a month for this term will the term\nHas ended it was a thirty year term and has ended and he says will uh so we called him up and says All right I like to do a another product another term policy how much is it\nAnd they said nine hundred and Seventy five dollars he says my God\nHe said uh is is that in mind is that is that for a year and he ... and they said no way yeah\nAnd you know if you think about it you know we're term uh first of all when the terms in and you want to do another term your older so you're you're you're going to rate higher okay in in addition to that you may have had some kind of health issue okay so that can cause the rates to jump up to us\nSo there's a lot of things to to talk about when you come in\nThe gang date issue products are not that great so but if you've had a major issue like heart shirt at heart attacks or\nA diabetes or anything like that you can look for a major writer your boss your group terms are they going to look at that that is they don't write you based on your health\nThat point you know my little car fiscal do it so you know you look at considerable higher premiums\nSo that's what we deal with that we deal at all kinds of stuff of we've dealt with it for Seventy five years ... experience we got actually Seventy five years not like some people say they got they don't have we have satisfy me are you at\nThirty six thirty six and the insurance industry and I\n... and I'm Still kicking like all the time I watch I keep all ticket [laughter]\nYeah he's still got to a charge battery

...\nThree mobile\nFox News alert I'm Jane ... a mass shooting in Pittsburgh it happened at the tree of life synagogue in the world hill neighborhood local media now reporting eight people are dead this Pittsburgh Police officials saying a short time ago\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixteen percent of their time on the show again they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me that if the caravan\nWeren't a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these\nPeople creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America and that may yet happen down the road that CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen\nHint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure\nThat was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet everybody\nWants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm of\nWhat's happening every day at our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf they're behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white the narrative and didn't want it last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you would know but common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there so you about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump there's one the issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right word but they would be my only disappointment particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras\nBut these are all great points they already qualified\nFor asylum in the first country free country they find themselves in after escaping\nTheir own country\nAnd if they don't apply for asylum in the first place that they can\nThen they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted and it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left\nI think it it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end\nIt may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises its eventual waiting but I think this was the left behind it for\nA host of reasons every one of which we should

some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizes the care of and by the way the\nThe details on that story are from the uh oh here's one\nFrom NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes\nLast night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into my go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote their son wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world would want that and why\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica\nWhat ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what takes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never did push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals one of the world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft discovery is gathering and one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young\nWho haven't lived long enough to know what's best for being driven stole my by a

or to help the benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having amassed a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and saint of the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped it but it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democrat Party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\n\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as\nAn entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning\nAny thing\nThe next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are

exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it\nOr in due course same thing on this transgender business a Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification\nAnd I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer out we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like\nThis but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because a positive comments out of ... that normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military just stopping invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nKnow he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay\nWhat seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections [laughter]\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside and left the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks it's a joke you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communist think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up\nFor Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized border that if they bomb rushed the border like it down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean you you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump soon as a military down and he started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people are playing this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own he leads to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point

weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pet it anymore\nBut what is troubling is to look behind it and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as as to who believe [noise]\nAnd he does it I think because it still works instill rile people up\nDivides us horrible yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear every election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you and Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling to look behind the Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now who believes this he does it I think because it's still works\nAt sea so Trump promised he pretty smart Trump knows when he's probably knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for

the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been and unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever\nHe never learned to keep Israel opinions

women disgraceful you for which Americans left in writer ashamed of him as they are I'm JFK and Bill Clinton but\nGartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the course most of ... constrained average American that Mr Trump conveys that caution is this unprecedented makes us look band other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents worry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it\nThe difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump\nAnd those who can live with him whether they love are merely tolerated even comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer the factory ham the auto mechanic machinist teamster shop owner clerk software engineer infantry men truck driver housewife\nDonald Trump was elected president by a significant electoral college margin\nThey can't win these elections that they've been hoping and praying to win ever since all these special elections now the midterms coming up looking out they're lying to themselves about the future are going to win back control of the house or what are they going to do with it they're going to investigate Trump\nNancy Pelosi can't help herself she is bragging talking about the subpoena power is that really what the American people want they want Donald Trump than the people who worked for him brought up under investigation for two years\nInstead of real life on the ground improving the way it is\nIs this what the Democrats in media really think it's just what they're left wing candidates really believe that the American people are so filled\nWith rage Donald Trump and his administration they want all of them investigated they want all of them put in jail they want the truth to come out but Trump cheated against Hillary with Russia\nThey're still obsessed with this stuff they're obsessed with the fact that this election was they're stolen\nFrom them and now it's time to make it All right and they are convinced that you know\nWhat Trump investigated to aunt there just to be tied to Henry persuade you to join the\nSo now you're part of the problem and so the American left in the media are actually trying to create a nation that consists of a majority of angry deranged lunatics in order to get what\nThey the media and the

Ramos or whatever it is it is what does he tell among do ... what what what does it tell us tell them no but what is it Univision right and he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob\nWhere packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter]\nThey don't look like the kind of people you want to run in to [noise] you know\nOn the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past them he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's now gene for him he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're different people and all they want is a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people and let somebody in that all they want is what we want\nWe all have these various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how would the walk and this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight\nThousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching\nHim that these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nHe doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and it's doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nBut to sit there and to try to vouch for eight thousand people and to tell his audience who'd they all are and why we all of them and why we need to open our borders to them\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats pool asked about the timing worry them and national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this\nEven before the caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony in the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers\nPersuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which she has doubled down on\nBy the way so this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are every day anyway whether people show up in a group the tour five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this\nIt may make no sense it later with that because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party\nSelf and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone\nYou gotta put yourselves in their shoes everyday\nThey've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times how Trump's toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with food is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been good so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality and their perplexed because none\nOf what they have done has worked in a white has worked ... it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied\nOver it they're at their which candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance

what couldn't you'll be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing\nThat really makes any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try to

something to make it look likely in saying lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact\nOf lunacy on your side as average American voters perceive it okay let's get\nSome of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what\nWhat real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as\nAn unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place\nWas on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top up here and Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have real clear politics and analyzing it is not there is no crafting there is no blue wave\nIf a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it he forecast that Democrats might win the house\nThat they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats they're projecting\nA democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house so all of this synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sleep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising\nAll her on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple of two Republicans and gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of these things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past the cause of Trump neutralizing much of it [noise] and Trump is the great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another\nRetired historian and political analyst sends an email that I received a lawsuit but I've been able to have it it was just this morning\nAnd I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them\nBut I just want to share with your some of the things I get some of the is by the way legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me a into promoting whatever it is that I have to be very very careful about I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you\nThis passion Italy this guy who is it a story and who has studied American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone just not as well known as he looks at things here is an absolute\nRed wave and he did not believe this until last night\nHe's been seeing trends the past two weeks but he has been reluctant to\nConvert into these trends are the actual prediction until now he says the numbers he's looking at from Nevada are exceptional in Minnesota Keith Ellison is crave a ring the whole Democratic Party now Amy ... is in a seven point race she was not too long ago in a in a\nFor pollsters now that the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all this down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and it was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nThat's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's gotta be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge\nLate surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys mislaid change the story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again it probably won't don't worry about at Bloomberg says but it\nCould it could go in either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose big it going to ... what what is all those indecision all of a sudden versus all of this on a logical ... to ... just a month ago\nHolds couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct\nSo they still have that reputation as all of a sudden it could be really really close much\nCloser than we ever ever knew gets a cycle and you can print\nRush Limbaugh on

to be discovered\nThe Democrat they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't stoop to everything from they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to they'd even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't stoop to something that's whoa it tell\nGoing along along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense\nFor a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\n\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around what\nDoes it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I'm spent so much time dwelling on this today\nAnd the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have assured us for the last nine months it was going to go more port going it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they
