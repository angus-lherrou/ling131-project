Don rollers wrap it up Mueller's got smaller is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking about\nBefore them in terms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping\nThey're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done\nWe'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's stole the election\nIs imminent that is what they're hoping they are hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on the educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia\nAnd that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create\nThis cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger that port\nHandles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms when\nMullet releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might\nAll of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waving to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his boss the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not\nOut there for for ... when does your support for Trump again during the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the regents that I'd\nBe during the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay\nAgainst a seven anyway he um [noise] I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy on trying to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away exactly\nAnd so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says she only reason the only way I can get my message out well his tweet too good but not that many people really hear it and I can understand why he is not addressed the nation I don't understand\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time\nAnd the press conference they ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can never remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made in the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit for the country doing well and that shocked geo right\n[noise] you know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy ... regular I've ever seen or we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really you you made it sound like your frustration is with him because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read your\nAudience that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration in the U.S is with a news media and many people are in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people going to go out and vote and they have no idea your newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nTo do you read\nThem but the economy you you said you've never

them a wage is going up what am I ever seen anything\nMy point is I think you're going to be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you can be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but I think\nWhat happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not cherry district corporate surprised they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievements\nTo take a

insists he's not giving cover to the king and the crown prince other although I just want to find out what's happening in Turkey reportedly has recorded evidence we've asked for it if it exists he expects a full report from the secretary of state to his on his way back to Washington\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this is not about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country\nIt is a modern era of generic peaks in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspapers one of them's big one of them small one of them is very serious take them to feel very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more\nPure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has\nTo be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something air mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento River\nA couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist ... little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a a a piece on somebody\nCan be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's\nIt's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no one's about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars and I've never seen them in and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave can lean on is this is one of the the editor the head honcho of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most the pick of all human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected\nBy life to him every body is a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the white guy just journalist is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just as there they they have some kind of a relationship but it's not clear to me like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about a Pdf file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ...\n\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in and the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it live with it\n\nIn the primary I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no if you or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience the belief\nThat everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter]\nIt's amazing how this in the eyes\nOf a journalist an editor\nNow I imagine a real journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\n\nThe competing editor of the clean paper above board paper is a woman who gets out art in tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirm the ... story while the other paper puts it on the cover having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other members doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got as a beat up I'll just get it up there and get it on the news stands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts to run it and so the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking they obviously are not worried about the me too movement here\nEver put this thing together so the name of this press I have no idea it's it's I think it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um\nIt's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things it's it's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's it's bad hit\nEverybody everybody as a rubber ... including the people at the papers\nThe reporters [noise] um\nI I have to admit I was so [noise] anyway here's non Brazil now I Would I did not lose my play she's ... bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed\nAnd remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho those are the DNC the Democratic party who in her normal countenance would be out there so oh yeah boy wave Democrat's gonna win ... it's our time people are fed up but that's not how she sounds\nHe's twenty days in a long time in politics [laughter] I'm not breaking out the champagne and I'm not trying to scramble my eggs before I get my chickens right we still have to improve turnout turnout turnout turnout\nDemocratic victory depends on turnout among millennials one on a farm millennials voted in the last midterm we also got to make sure that we get a paint way before we can get a blue tie we need these women to win that race is I'm confident not over confident\nAnd you ask me today well but I Do differently in terms of Democrats would target Latinos I Would talk to millennials\nOkay so what what did she do differently she's saying here that Democrats are dropping the ball with Latinos why is she saying that well because she has the freedom to say it she's not at the moment in the in the hierarchy\n\nPrior to kick off on your local offer jak football Ninety six one of the rocket and heart radio just searched Jack Jack ...

M.\nFox News finally in lieu I Want to find out what happened where is this fall\nPresident Trump saying he expects to know more by the end of the week and that the journalists presume murdered in these tatty constantly in Istanbul, Turkey for stressing the importance of Saudi Arabia\nIf you look in Saudi Arabia there in LA and there was tremendous purchaser of not only military equipment but other things when I went there they committed to purchase for a hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of things could\nHave saved my pants on his way home after a visit to turkey and the kingdom and a lot of daydreaming going on on some long lines has a pair of jackpots\nGrows if I'm wanting to women that I'll just take a nice driven by myself and go out and\nMake a million ... nine hundred million that drains friday tonight Powerball trying that jackpot\nThree hundred and forty five female\nWe have one day in terms of exposing\nSean Hannity all of the deep state all of their corruption W when GM [noise]\n\n\n\n\nWelcome back okay back to the phones and go I'm I'm I'm not through making the point is blue wave stuff but there's a lot of\nLike here's a CNBC poll do not expect a big democratic wave this fall I got three stories that are out here plus Don of Brazil about this now\nI don't want to make too much of it about the best thing that we can say about it is that they are losing confidence or maybe they are just purposely dialing it back for\nStrategic reasons and I still think there is going to be what I I I don't think that's what's going on here I don't think they're able to discipline themselves\nUniversally unilaterally across the drive by leftist board there's always going to be some renegades metal bust out of any attempt\nA in something like this but\nWe'll get back to this I Need to get back to the phones first Canton, Mississippi and a ... nice to have you welcome to the emergency network\nLike Mr lumbar I appreciate it does have definitely a bucket list item for me\nWhen I'm flattered I appreciate that very much\nSo I had a a different take on why they're not going to release anything from them Mueller investigation before the terms\nAnd not not that I Would say you're wrong I mean I just uh I don't think that they have anything against Trump and they don't want it to the point the Democrats' chances and you know boost the Republicans' chances in the mid term [noise]\nWell uh\nI that would be a wonderful and magnificent if that's true of all I can tell you is for what it's worse there is\nIn in the in the quote unquote cannons a procedure in our revered and vaunted department of justice that nothing they do should impact elections mean call me even at this\nAs reasons for doing some of the things that he did it now\nI Know I Know I Know it looks like he was doing the exact\nOpposite forget what he did for a moment it's what he said there is telling you is that there is this it may even be a written regulations for all I Know\nBut it I I Am for certain that it is and acknowledge gentlemen lady procedure that the the O. J. you know Doug balances of justice\nThe scales of justice third wind the department of justice does nothing including indictments that would impact and election now\nThe Hillary cases do they had to exonerate heard their futures dependence on up their careers depended on it and she was a Democrat nominee they're not going to be in the business\nOf charging and pursuing and diving the Democratic nominee again ... the unwritten regulations not impacting the election so it does exist\nAnd it probably is a factor in smaller report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know what could happen\nSince they've decided to leak that Mueller is about finished\nSince they've decided to leak that the report is imminent let me get that headline again just to not have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise] [noise]\nNow you know this was going to drive the left literally batty that it it it they're not going to be able to restrain themselves how long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that\nSide of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is how long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon\nOr little Brian style turned Jake Tapper any of these are the start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we not insured affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds are that are pretty good or not well let's play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein whoever\nAnd somebody\nLike Trump says well okay All right if you want to see him and they release it\nAnd there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three week what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks had one a week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the good yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIf Mueller doesn't have any of that than there is no way they want this release before the midterms that's why\nNow he's out there are calling the porn star who by the way is a back stabbing black mailing double crossing porn star is that they're calling a horse race\nAnd there are shutters and the drive by me the s U D D the\nPresident's doesn't next you know what I find interesting about this\nAll of these so called parent kinds of virtue on the left where one twin perversion has become normal in their world and they demand that we accept wanting perversion as normal they sit there and act like\nThey're all women Austin but we're not talking to a woman we're talking about a dual at ... at what porn star\nDouble crossing\nBack stabbing woman who has tried to destroy the guy with her third rate lawyer\nShe's not just an innocent ordinary everyday woman the Trump decided to call in name\nShe is a woman who attempted to him\nBut for these liberal Democrats these people in the media to act like people don't talk to sweat presidents don't\nCome on\nPeople talk this way this is what resent what I resent about this the idea that they are cleaning shores the wind driven snow and they don't think this way they don't talk this way what an absolute crock simply looked at the things they say about us during the course of your average political day\nFrom your Hitler through your Nazis to Europe this or that they make fun of people's appearances they make fun of people I mean they're they're comedy has become literally\nHate and then they act like\nOne of the greatest social ... question Jim ... history of humanity is occurring when Donald Trump uses the term horse face well when he did not mark balls the Ford but simply ...\nFeet in the truth about her allegations I just I just find that to just a little bit hollow as do take your pick take it to take your pick any left wing or on media griping about\nTrump's using the word horse race and ask yourself if that media reporter never talk that way and the answer but Russia these people are president and he is and this has been nice the dignity the\nPresidency well I Know they look at it and think of it that way my point is they can try all day long that's not going to separate Trump from his voters as some of\nHis voters like the Senate in fact that there's so much good going on here and focus on that don't don't mean to distract everybody with that stuff\nBut he did\nThey're also going to they're not going to give up trying to link Donald Trump to the murder of the uh of the journalist is in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nUh your mouth to show me they're still working on that\nBut I think they're frustrated to no end that nothing they do works\nAnd now I have a story I have to print I haven't had the chance to printed yet just cleared the trans certainly here uh it's about Trump's approval numbers are probably much better and much higher than anybody on the left and
