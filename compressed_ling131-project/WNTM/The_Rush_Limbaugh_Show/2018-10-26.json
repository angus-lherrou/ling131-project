with a lot of a Donald Trump stuff on his van but you know let's wait for information you know we we there were people who said uh on the right\nFalse flags they were those on the left that said it was a conservative um we've said the whole time let's wake for information might be a crazy guy and might be\nAt those amazing to just say I'm a lot of people will make a prediction with no evidence on something like this right they'll say oh it was a right wing or or it was a left where\nAnd then when it turns out to be one of those two they claimed victory as if what they did was was a good idea you know it wasn't that not a good idea you know the fact that you come out and you say are you blame the right with no evidence and then it turns out to be someone on the right that doesn't make you we're we're process good right like I say\nI'm Sorry I should I I just [laughter]\nI just read a comment from somebody has said this this van looks like what's Steve Bannon would turn into if he was a transformer [laughter]\n\nMay I ask that ... oh [laughter]\n\nOh that's funny [laughter] that is not a bad description though not as bad and you know it's\nAgain it's\nYou know what do you do hear with these things it does at the very least it is at least we can hopefully avoid any injury remember there's been literally nothing that's happened with these been a big media spectacle but you know ... much less of\nA media spectacle that what happened when Trump and many others mad at us and others in the government received white powder in the mail\nLast week or two weeks ago so you know I obviously we know why it's a bigger a bigger deal now\nNumber one it was a media member specifically that was targeted in this with CNN getting one of the packages and number two obviously uh the uh the chance to kind of blame this broadly against the right is going to be something that the media is going to take advantage of it at all\nPossible but we don't know yet and we'll find out from this person to see if they were ... you know how\nThe ... the attempt was when we look at the bottom construction will find that out and we always find that you know it's all you want more information quickly but getting the right information and making sure you know what's going on is is always a better choice\nAnd a and it's also remember that we did not condemn Bernie Sanders\nFor the shooter Bernie Sanders was not responsible for that the crazy guy who did it was\n[noise] and then at the same airing\nNews radio seven ten WNBA I'm\n[noise] we're talking about debt consolidation newsmakers today I'm leery Morgan did you know the average household pays nearly Thirteen hundred dollars in credit card interest each year Thirteen hundred\n[noise] um [noise]\nI also have something sense to me here said that he was um\nI'm from Avon tour a and a member of the Green Party but what I don't see anything on here that says he is all there it is about political party Green Party birthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty two ah income information pending what does this site\nCan't tell what this site is it it's um [noise]\nAny weight identified as soon as a member of the Green Party a yeah he's got pictures of Trump and he's a GOP stickers all over the uh the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon\nThey don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our\nCory Booker the New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper ruby recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable\nThat they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them blow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here\nAnd a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks and this is typical during events like this everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd until a law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a daily use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy\nIdentifying the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad go bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide\nPresumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set up at the people Trump is this is this is the uh the narrative if you will drive buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are what\nAre matters of same thing is happening today with the economic news we ever GDP report today the growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so the drive by reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression\nAmong the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\n\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth\nIs it didn't come into the at the British in three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically\nGoogle also all those alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every and they're they're stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive buys to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still truck getting right along with the drive laws are reporting the day\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this\nFrom the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunately the bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I fought a left wing media narrative that had been created\nBut apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump to today complained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted from news about the terms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and that the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly swallows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that's his tweet\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has you might this his I sadly I Wish you weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news\nAnd what is it\nIf there isn't any knows about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it is it happening\nThe press like the Russians could be behind it because it just struck times have you with this whole thing was bound and determined to help a President Trump\nWhich means the Russians would have been but just\nThe way people think amazes me is always\nRush Limbaugh on news radio seven ten WN PM sponsored by the PC office technologies providing

Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot viewers is going to take action except the theory is\nCrackpot CNN viewers shut up a Republican baseball practice crackpot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about\nLetting loose with gunfire\nWe have\nAn example after example of attempted violence against conservatives and right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places and these are genuinely threatening people\n\nAnd they are confronting people and demanding that they leave\n\nAnd and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN can damning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj this is what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people is making them insane is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nAnd I believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it and ... the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people will see undermined people's data that Trump fires back at them\n\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless late as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about the misstated the miss characterize them they attempt to do it with you and the character in honor of conservative people\nSpokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun in a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\n\nSo we talk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody comes down to Trump\nA lot of people said Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply I Am not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and hide judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is turning perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this is Dan I mean if you if you wanted to decorate\nIn dress up a van that says notice may and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over to stop this is what you would do\nSo my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he convened a meeting black Leadership Conference a young black\nLeaders from all over the country this is not been done before in in this in this manner\nUm [noise] and he's talking about the arrest in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been male too high profile figures throughout our country band a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[laughter]\nCredible job by law enforcement we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nNow I wanted one can remind you of Trump pacing if if you think Trump is not as\n... pointed to just be or selling out just hang on I Want to remind you of Trump's first reaction after ... forge showed up\nAt the at the Senate Judiciary hearing what a Trump say I've found her very credible I really hope that she continues to testify I think if what happened there happened and Kevin maybe ... that's what he said at the beginning and he did it\nActually got to pretend and portray himself as on involves getting any policy that was going wrong or any mistakes that were being made\nPositions herself as an outsider tackling whoever was screwing it up a ... that's the ... the around the Obama effect not response that's we're going to the can accuse Trump\nBack in the second Rush Limbaugh on news radio seven ten W

Fox News a man arrested in Florida in connection with the mail bomb pro but that now includes a dozen packages and all the Justice Department said to hold a news conference at this hour boxes Rachel

enthusiasm to I don't know what\nEarly vote a registered to vote was too late for that but whatever it was ... and now Trump has joined that parade President Trump today complained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting that this scare\nHas distracted from news about the mid terms and even slowed Republican momentum he said Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens\nAnd the momentum greatly slows news not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans go out and vote that was Trump's tweet\nNow\nThere are some who believe that this is another example of Trump pacing\nJust like when he made his original statements about Christine balls the Ford being credit ball and compelling and then later\nSort of lowering the boom on her at a rally pointing out that she really had no evidence and no way to back up what she was alleging so some people think that he's a during the same thing here are basically tampering expectations\nWith the bombers suppression of state but the trumps out there are lowering expectations setting people up so I asked to be able to say we overcame the bomber and we did great anyway\nAnd there's some people think that this is very very artful love Trump that he's getting really really good at this\nLowering expectations while he knows things are going to go well and then when they do go well he can go back and look at what we had to overcome luck of the obstacles that we did we came through\nAnd we try out so we will see Charlie Kirk a turning point you asked a\nTweet in uh let's see there be yesterday that the presidential approval rating has hit forty seven percent of his highest yet I don't need it aside the poll I'll guarantee you it's not a CNN poll\nAnd it probably is it an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen\nButter forty seven percent in whatever pull it is is Trump's highest\nAnd also forty seven percent is free points higher than Obama's approval rating under twenty ten minute terms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten midterms\n\nThis there's certainly a little pop quiz on history now admittedly this is eight years ago it seemed like eight years ago that Obama was president and mid term but how many seats the Republicans win\nIn two thousand ten men terms how\nSick the free\nThe Republicans one sick the three now in those terms conventional wisdom one out conventional wisdom is the party out of power makes big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but kirks point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent and rising\nAnd therefore we uh we could be looking here at the and a bit\nOf an upset [noise] there's also polling Davis here in Florida and let me let me find this it is ...\nBarely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum was leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted for great TV\nAnd released a couple of days ago shows Ron this Santas pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half\nSo statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am reading by the way\nThat it is possible that the FBI is gonna in tight Gillum had some ... regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the corrupt practices have been investigated\nFor a we had the news that he had he paid an under\nCover cuts\nThe money to buy Hamilton tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails and tax raise questions on Gillum trips with lobbyist records show Gillum new well in advance that he was out of state meetings with Adam Corey could help him network with power for developers businessmen and lawyers\nI mean this is incredible that a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald is\nA it's a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there is a Politico story today actually saw it last night\nTrump fears a Florida wipe out that Donald Trump fear is that we're going to lose everything in Florida the socialist in Florida are going to win everything\nAnd so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort in Florida to try to save the day here it is a political stir and that's the word is being used the Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThere are other news stories that soon ... dredge has links to them that are the socialists of America appear ready

bottom lines of this story is that New Jersey has\nBeen moved to toss up in the cook report New Jersey has been moved to toss New Jersey ought to be deadlock Democrat any day of the year that you look at it New Jersey being in in a toss up and Florida\nRemains a coin toss although Democrats see a path to victory for US Senator Bill Nelson well they better he's the incumbent he would have the path
