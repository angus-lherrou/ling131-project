Peruvian\nOne one thousand twenty fourth Colombian and mushy trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of empty and DNA why is there not much Indian DNA out there\nOr was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need to expand\nIt to include south Americans\nWhen other reason there isn't much in the DNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine the limit injured they use junior logical trace\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus in this country in the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that\nStory I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA be cause they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize\nDNA in any of this but ... the media of course has a role here because everything they've reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from a little kid but that's wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... take the kids take the take the test of his kids using it in a debate future debate\nAnd that's what he meant that she wouldn't do any better that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this Trump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and fill out the American left and I\nHave I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about\nThe Democratic party is poised to really take everything they can in this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point we're going to take the Senate but then if you look\nAt the reality of\nVoting patterns just in the past ... years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all and two thousand ten do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand four team in terms\nOf the Democratic party who lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships\nA you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost\nWell over a hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beep in and near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother robot sure where they were going to sweep may never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty eight elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\n\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago\nFrom two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want us talking about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nRock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party nobody knows it because of the things

there's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say not like\nPeople care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to

expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near the wake of\nDonald Trump or does it like this is like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me

journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or\nAnything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's being one of them small one of them is very serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than\nPure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIts fight out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same\nPowerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy people being people powerful people rich people\nThere obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something they're mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ...\nCall 'em out and and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their\nCrosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nThey said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that to its about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalists are these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a a a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today\nIt's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin all it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer\nOr writers I don't recognize the stars and I've never seen them and and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watch this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's a ... a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen early on is this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is pick up all human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years\nAnd he is totally on affected\nBy life\nTo him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journal is is the world has no solutions\nI'll stop what what if that were your world view the world has no solutions and he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just that they're that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from\nWay back before the series began and the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you and I'm ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and\nLive with it and the private ...
