hasn't come close\nDoesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru\nHe's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned to Nate Silver just stay sane when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nOr pads because that was said pets get us in the silver guy nice guy but he's

to temper all these so called experts with some reality\nTo the guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be true and so it becomes a girl

and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump ... and the er the birthright citizenship today the Dems are still mad about it all kinds of experts being trotted out\nIt's unconstitutional no it's certainly constitution no it isn't there you've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of his many people getting into countries again Democrats saying the same thing\nBut it's out there it's a conversation starter nothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as all it is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump\nDoes made it it is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded in the snow complicated\nMystery that this is just what it is that's who the opponents are very hell bent and they're not going to stop\nUntil they until they went and now the Mueller investigation looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come\nBack to life remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced that Mahler by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen to that would be a leak or does that would be some kind of education and yet ... zero not at the latest from Muller is if somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time\nThat they so boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind or try to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up the election is a big deal psychologically and tell me these people really thought you you wouldn't be amazed at how many people\n\nThe drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion this population they have believed from the first day that Trump the first day they herded the Trump stole the election they have believed that Mueller has found that they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it and he was holding it and it's going to release of the most opportune time\nDespite the fact there isn't any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because they're going to happen\nIt did happen between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a shred of evidence\nAnd yet they're still holding out hope Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that how many months maybe over a year now\nHave there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking should lawyers making sure that Trump wants to send the stories when his lawyers say no way\nMeanwhile the conversations never happen Trump never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides were participating in\nThe news now is the Trump might speak with Mahler after the election might answer some questions after the election\nThe takeaway is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump end when the house and Senate has fizzled it's\nNot there so they're turning they always do to other things\nAlso have the usual parade um celebrities\nBrain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have proven that we really are not motivated to do anything celebrities advise\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist\nWe now have the Oprah were told they offer is going to go into Jordan\nDaughter we don't want your joints son in law we don't want any of you here go away but Trump goes to the hospital one of the professionals treated the wounded and it gets very very warm welcome\nYou don't see that report it\n[noise] [noise] [noise] um\nThey continue to try to lay the blame on Trump for this\n\nAnd it just wears you out I Know people are telling me it just wears you out every day you got us the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in the story but it's the same thing\nAnd people say Russia's gonna win them in terms folks there isn't a soul out there who knows who's going to win the midterms\nThere isn't a single person out there who has the slightest

before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen that it would be a leak wanted there would be some kind of indication and yet ... zeroes not at the latest from Muller is if somebody is running a scam on him a sex scandal of some time\nThat they so boring to me I haven't even delved into the details but Muller is saying that people are trying to run a sex scam on him up some kind or tried to or what have you all all I Know is that that's the last thing that the left was counting on Robert Mueller having to say\nIn the days and weeks leading up the election is a big deal psychologically I'm telling you these people really thought you you would be amazed at how many people\n\nThat drive by media the American leftist propagandize significant portion of this population they have believed from the first day that Trump the first day they heard at the Trump stole the election they have believed that Mueller has found they believe Mahler was going to find it and didn't find it and it's holding it and it's going to release of the most opportune time\nDespite the fact that in any evidence more there never has been any evidence for because they're going to happen\nIt did happen in between Hillary the Democrats but it didn't happen with Trump there isn't a shred there will not be a\nShred of evidence and yet they're still holding out hope Mueller and his people trying to remain relevant\nRising from the dead looking like Trump may answer some questions after the election remember the news stories about that how many\nMonths maybe over a year now have there been stories about Trump will or won't submit the questioning by Mahler lawyers thinking should lawyers Mickey shouldn't Trump wants to set the story is but his lawyers say no way\nMe and while the conversations never happen Trump never met with mother never answered written questions they weren't submitted a total non story that both sides were participating in\nThe news now is the Trump might speak with Mahler after the election might answer some questions after the election\nTakeaway is that the primary weapon the Democrats thought they had to get rid of Trump and when the house and Senate has fizzled\nIt's not there so they're turning they always do to other things\nWe also have the usual parade\nOf celebrities brain dead idiots celebrities vomiting their opinions throwing away their money we have proven that we really are not motivated to do anything celebrities advise\nIt has been a long established the celebrities do not move public opinion when nobody is worried about celebrities think or do in that sense because they don't and yet they persist we now have\nThe Oprah were told they offer is going to go into Georgia and campaign for the Democrat governor for Georgia Stacey what his name Abrams what is the last time the Oprah was a factor in an election can anybody telling me\nYou think Obama's first victory was was when was time to to to the Oprah\nEvery day you got us the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in the story but it's the same thing and people say Russia's gonna win them in terms folks there isn't a soul out there who knows who's going to win the midterms\nThere isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea I don't care what Paul and you look at I don't care what professional here talk to I don't care what great really an analyst there is there isn't anybody who knows\nWho's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data and breaking it our way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling days at a polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that ...\nNobody knows bottom line\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good world do you know why\nI think it was was it two thousand and fourteen two thousand twelve was one of those\nTwo elections were Nate Silver lucked into calling every state on the money\nAnd that feet\nWon the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him this reputation that he is intolerable since that won election where he was infallible he hasn't come close doesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a guru\nHe's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned in Nate Silver just stay sandman when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard pat ... said pets get us in the silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll all he does his analyze them\nHe's never participated in a poll either the polling company he's never run a campaign and it's a ... point was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality\nThat guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be true\nAnd so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this was like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\nSo you can't you can't succumb to the temptation here to go ... and to become flat line\nAnd it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much\nAnd at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against\nYou and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump print to end the or the birthright citizenship\nToday the Dems are still mad about it\nAll kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's certainly constitution no it isn't then you've got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of as many people getting in the country is again Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started his own of is Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump\nDoes made it it is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded in\nThe snow complicated mystery that this is just what it is that's who the opponents are hell bent and they're not going to stop\nUntil they until they went and now the Mueller investigation looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come\nBack to life remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced that Muller by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nYou know how many people on the left believed that\nAnd how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen that it would be a leak wanted

there doing what the offer was doing an Obama would not have won\nOkay Obama what is still wanted despite what the Oprah was headed Barbra Streisand Barbra Streisand's out so she's trying to gin up\nAnti Republican vote by promising people to move to Canada if the Republicans hold the house\n... anybody cares about that\nOther than the people say go head move it's going to motivate me to vote

Thomas at at the Pentagon\nDenied every weekday news radio Seventy WN GM [noise]\n[noise]\nOkay listen to and again this is Monday Night on CNN it's taken a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\nNon ... lemon says it on Monday Night on CNN and its noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week and can turkey another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of it I'm radicalized to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nYou know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what is your reaction to this I mean this folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban them that that may be something that he individually holes with the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's got on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view of the American left it as white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been to transform America away from the\nTraditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust\nAn unfair they continue to point to slavery as the primary and evidence the primary example or exhibits\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets mentioned whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more grounded in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using a victim of allergy and victimhood into a she\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men\nContinue to run it and be at white men or continue to be the majority and they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of\nPeople you notice how quickly they want to do bad notice how quickly on the left the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always the result of environmental things\nSo on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things I think it's day if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs\nPulling the trigger on the guns who is it that's in raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon and said this is a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't Republicans in that group look in the number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders of\nBeen defended and explained away by people like you in the sense\nWell they're cops and they mistreating they're racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound to people ... almost did die it's amazing these people that way they talk and the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or vey Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrats voting bloc\nMuslim Americans in fact maybe even more reliable Democrat vote than black voters\nOr a general General David Dinkins where there are fifty four where are you parity yes indeed that was\nGreat longer hear it again someday but I just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline went down\nTwo days ago and I recall the last plane went down in Malaysia CNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went\nThat [noise] yeah\nWhere did it go down\nIn leaders Taiwan there but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is going I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link at the Trump a good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there is no way to use that\nCrash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking day how I'm not I'm not joking and all they don't care about it because it has no impact it has no usage they can see in affecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections\nDon't worry they'll get to it when the other side of the time to attack a\nCorporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just trying to remember CNN going wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN neighbors there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in last place out there and ah this was that was pre Trump\nAnd the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are below the TV so they believe and then the mystery is a damn thing\nWhere is it Don Lemon even ask the former director of National Transportation Safety Board could it have been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\nChance but certainly remember that Americans are ...\n... ... ... they had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became a standing joke\nYou know that the the best way to make anything you're doing success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo Google\nCNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what you want to wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw a headline\nNews maybe where Monday morning ... in ... was the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent uh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever uh forget what you call that program you\nKnow I just wanted to kill your that that was not one little usually anytime the plane goes to show them that many people especially it was a brand new planning that\nNow what are you such a brand new playing what kind of play it was he was bullied will you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be limited done are somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news is still a brand new plan going down is unusual and ah we went out\nTo the sea sucked into it I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest uh upgrade of the seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide body\nAnd not as widely courses a jumbo jet wide body but it's stuffy and they have a mixed ended a damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down but it didn't go down in America a Donald Trump had nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case\nUh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... so\nThat no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash to the mid term elections they'll get to\nLimbaugh because we know for you the best school do on the ...

everybody\nThinks for everybody cares about well I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted if the momentum was interrupted defend imaging level decline than wire Trump's rallies still ... over the he's got one in Fort Myers like in Fort Myers\nYeah Ford myself thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies\nPlanned between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election\nAnd he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy\nReviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence consumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how all the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration and buddy is having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media's not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting\nThis is\n... you know I I circle back to I really don't know what's gonna happen on election day and I don't believe in doubles does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and then yeah that's a toss up you want to believe what do you not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close I mean we don't know\nWe never know until the aftermath\nHere's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidate to individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweet and his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you\nSome people it's horrible what Trump said about why\nIsn't why isn't it when he isn't it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had\nTo disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\nIt's\nIt's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\n\nWhich is\nThe design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway it was a great\nPiece today speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question during the Kavanaugh hearings\nRemember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the foreign with her allegations whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all the spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward claiming they had evidence\nOf it none of them ever present at any but\nThe media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody the cabinet was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named to the Supreme Court he is the passes it gets ... got the confirmation vote\nAnd is in sworn in why did the media drop it if Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I Would have Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are rubber rate serial rapists where is all they just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility and all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political dont\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kavanaugh if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed him the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why are they doing that there is a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion of Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching cabinet where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every day I'm One of these is\nNone of what they were saying about capital was true it was all manufactured they didn't bring bossy for up until the very end as a Hail Mary\nIf balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses she would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her\nNot Jimmy made laying eyes to terrify the here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYou Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking the Democrat opponents\nThey still opposed Kevin ...\nDon't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... or oppose Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign and we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded\nLet's pretend that some of the momentum was lost all okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nWho did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\n\nAnd over paid I'm Alone we knew it\nWe're here to change that with you again one thousand dollars wouldn't one thousand dollars a day every hour radio seven times though when you when we\nPassed each hour before you're sixteen and when I feel I mean it did make it\nRained in front of your least favorite co workers driven by mobile bay Harley Davidson new ownership view wedded to the Gulf Coast Vermeer spot for all things Harley Davidson is where you could get a new army for as low as one oh nine a month find their events on Craig's book there's always a party at ...

you so much closer to my call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the regime was becoming mine and I handle I started writing my class of course there's because I couldn't handle how they had revised American history [noise] reason I called was ... topic on immigration\nIntegration I said in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nBut most people don't understand is when these millions of people came over to Ellis Island we didn't just open our ... come on in the way if Democrats want it now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nEspecially looking after I take a device him like open up\nThe upper island and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that\nNo one to ship doctor perform his examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination doing the trick coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people\nOh were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because to ship doctor really did us or have if you were sent back they ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they want to make sure we did not want any on that quite not work\nWas not healthy and watch not strong\nYou realize that what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then\nWhere am I that's what people are thinking listening to retell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work um there was a saying that sat I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets with tape with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one page Street's\nBut we get not what people would be on welfare we did not want those people we want it only strong healthy people that's been totally\nLeft out of history books and I can't tell you how much it frustrates me to listen to these Democrats\nTalk about how wonderful and we will all how a lot of fighting not true\nI have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about the kind of history he's going to be learning it's um I don't get on giving him for Christmas one if you're ... oh wow man very was hurt because I think that\nWhere's he going to get it is not going to learn it was on his ... all revised they can't even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nTry a paragraph Abraham Lincoln I John Silver Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties\nDid a survey and the most popular high

know is Howard Zinn Howard's in as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a ... a socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program\nSo over Thirty years in one white thank you very much a Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about Alice Alice I not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe were much newer and younger country boom and we had an entirely different attitude about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were\nAllowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nAre you ready when apple announced that's the new ... book air is made of one hundred percent recycled aluminum\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a game a standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's all over the environmentalist wackos what's this age group have one\nMore than any technical advance for their achievement more than any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nAway for life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who have been brainwashed and propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\n[noise] holy smokes\nNow let's go to the audio soundbites vis vis folks I talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit the Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history president was greeted\nBy hungry protesters singing this land\nIs your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome until he saw what they perceived to be solved on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protests are not so ... what what does\nImmigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper the protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Congress hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not have come and that three did come they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center President Trump's first lady\nYou Monica Trump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue shows like\nThat rather than\n\nHaving your bags or you can reach\nShake your hand again\nThank you so much [laughter] I Can't keep having a chance\nYou will not see this on any network newscast you will not see that video on any news channel anywhere\nThank you thank you President Trump thank you thank you we love you thank you for coming thank you very much no thank you sir you're the best the best great job thank you Mr President we love you thank you can I shake your hand serve thanks so much thanks so much thank you so much thank you President Trump\n\nBut wait a minute Jake Tapper said the protest they're not surprised and nobody wanted the president there and it's not just Jake Tapper everybody in a drive by Mr President your sham trip and I thought this was not to replace you know business going they don't want you to forty five thousand people signed a petition asking him not\nTo come oh wait we're not true we stay at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center and\nNow I'm a lot of the first lady and if Monica Trump got some love to\nThank you parents meaning the phone [laughter]\nThank you very much anger and her name is John John you've paid me ... [laughter]\n[laughter]\nThat was a male employee looking at Jerry cushion are saying nobody ever heard of you laughing at his wife was a bigger star that's fine no problem everybody laughing about it but what is you're not going to see this anywhere I mentioned it to you in the opening our of the program that this is what happened\nThere are thousands of people already in line in Fort Myers awaiting a Trump rally there later tonight [noise] but nobody wants to Donald Trump anywhere she everybody hates everybody despises Trump everybody regrets that they voted for everybody can't wait\nTo vote for Democrats so the Trump can't do anything and everybody\nThe Democrats back in power so they can start investigating Trump and get rid of it that your drive by maybe\n\nThey don't show you the reaction of real people you will not see those videos you will not hear that audio anywhere\nReduce the number one would your personality or caused by a Rush Limbaugh muggy are being used radio\nWhy do ruled brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration laws\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight\nKevin McCarthy ... and did force the low\nExpands caseload to penalize women\nAnd insurers only American citizens have the right to vote\nEverybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is done that that's what conservatism was as a former movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but\nIn mid term elections I can I can show your countless in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody for casting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something odd um he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because of so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when that happened you should see and if you remember the bottom fell out but we didn't do just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody that Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives because everybody hated\nBush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in ... Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nAnd Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way and what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was done that drive by media couldn't believe it so they're\nExamples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey end up being surprised the brightest minds been greatest go rose the most heralded the analysts\nAnd it's all all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here is from uh motives are real clear politics by one of the written down the\nWhole analysts and data analyst there is Sean ... day I'm not going to read the whole thing it prints out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final stretch\nNominate tells you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as ... terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close you can take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a bunch of polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionately toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred Ken Democratic majority\nBut this is here splitting do a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five states are Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat pickups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here there's the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats and the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any\nBird because the truth is we don't know those are my words not Mr Trump days [noise]\nHis words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the racist can altered the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some racism good that the ... ship numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority and I swam Republican but wait he's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr print day here\nIs we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... do you can think of where it might their talent that way\nThe closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle well then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but that's just me into being smart alec\nUh in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three\nPercent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest\nBut what about the Nineteen representative John Faso is up by a point but the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so\nTrump's on the ballot or he isn't is it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things\nAnd then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines\nOr California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this would be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how reliable aren't than the state\nAnd then the next ... are we relying too much on one pollster\nOh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next one is early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know in the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election\nIs over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this\nDay largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens so what's going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the candidate\nCoal competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh so\nWe don't however no how big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are ten surprises regardless of whether that happens\nWe're well set up for such an event you out on the bottom line I have with the slightest idea what's going to happen but my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognize as one of the best one of the most respected real clear politics no idea no idea but dressing up with as much intelligence analysis you can muster\nDemocratic Party they are they in fact I I think the drive by media is actually the organizing power\nBehind the Democratic party to Mr ... you're saying this but he's he's saying that in his opinion a growing number of the American people are aware of it now\nThe federalist that's right that's right he was an Mollie Hemingway in a gang and his his opinion is that a more and more Americans are six simply aware\nOf the unfairness the imbalance and it I mean way be unbiased if if\nThat's true if a number of these things are true and then there could very well be a major\nSurprise and shock in store for the media and the Democrats on election day too\n'cause it's a parent
