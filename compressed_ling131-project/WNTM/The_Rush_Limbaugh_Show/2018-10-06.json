said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just meaning into terrorist jumps in hell no don't mean the end of tariffs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related

November first according to try calm finance ministry yesterday\nThe truck I was a pleasure to take steps to increase imports that means products from us this year amid rising tension with some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states\nBottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs his economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work\nAnd it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one that thought it was necessary to do and it's now done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made\nSince NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number than that with Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money\nAt the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or do jobs lost about twenty five percent of our on our jobs even more than the\nThroughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer than maybe forty five minutes or you know an extended\nThe statements\nOnly recently started taking questions will tell you what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocated he wasn't just announcing that deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take an insurance now and then it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets\nPicket there's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean that may cause we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not have ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important in how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other type people about whom Washington thinks not very off\nAnd thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about any kind of run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as a noun Singh is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually squandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people to know what they were talking but I got scared\nTo death at lesson hasn't\nBeen learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next

it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world

he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they want the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible\nShe's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge or she is the accuser so the Republicans\nThey've they they they played right along and without a head ritual Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was a all Trump is still is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can't poke holes in obvious\nPlaces you can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the\nDifferences in her story from depending on the day she's\nTelling it whatever it is it is not mocking Christine balls the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible entered testimony was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again\nTrump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting orbit dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth of the other my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media on the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nAnd to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay here\nIt's a regional statements into what he really thinks based on what is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen from one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change her serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at the moon to the right\nTo oh so he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what he thinks\nReally thinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans have Trump has Trump has a ... that after he makes\nAn initial statement on something that he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them see he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has ... continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how bull lying Leigh insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off Trump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\n\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nIn Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said it's true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just simply pushy kicking back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter why have we\nGotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accused any man of anything and it's gospel and then be joined by a so called movement called me to work all women can joined that can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine if men organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying women you can't even imagine that can you you can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\n\nWell rush or a million women or nor do there should we do well yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female range\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed and Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed a made up for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not\nUh in numbers but it's so out of balance all Trump did was\nSay what everybody following this knows even the Democrats are Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous\nFor our country that's what this is that's what the Democratic party isn't so and that's what Democrats senators have said that the accused has to prove he didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in what civilized society is that real\nThank throw a corner to say that I care for all you can go for all of the women who have really your fault but were afraid or embarrassed reporter\nUh well I knew you may have a ... I I I think you're you're right along you're right in line with one of my new found\nTheories and it's actually not a new found theory what it is is a very late arrival on my part of being able to verbalize\nYou've you've heard over the years liberalism mental diseases are all kinds of ... and I thought that that that's too simplistic and besides it's not effective I mean even if it's true it's not going to be effective say that\nBut that doesn't\nErase the fact that we're dealing with some genuine in comprehensible\nEmotional problems on the part of these people and I have to give credit where credit's due it was a little blurb by Jim guarantee at National Review that caused the explosion of brain ... in the frontal lobe beer\nHe said\nI'm paraphrasing it will have a right in front of me but you said I don't even think this is what I I think psychological disorders people the psychological disorders have become liberals in politics that that that that that psychological disorders\nPeople who have them have brought their disorders into politics and rather than just a singular thing had happened to them they make it all about the country did it to them or an entire population did it to them\nAnd I think that's exactly what liberalism and has become and that's where we agree\nRush Limbaugh on news radio seven ten WN PM sponsored by sea PC office technologies providing service that can't be copied visit them today at C.

um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for bad description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together\nAs one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bed is actually what they're looking for him and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that or the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it that's what the\n... this this um [noise] well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the um [noise] Occupy Wall street movement to look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes\nBecause the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people they capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nInsult people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to you that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether\n\nBoys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nSick it ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement that has been constructed\nTo push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter because it didn't happen to them these women we do know
