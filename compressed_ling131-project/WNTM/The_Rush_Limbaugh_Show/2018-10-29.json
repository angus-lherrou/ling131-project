under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts that are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price

they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up first today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rush pleasure to speak with you thank you sir hey\nI can tell you that last week in front of the Pittsburgh School or they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down eight to one\nThing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could have been prevented and then you have a mayor who's very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need is more gun control\nI mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control was not the answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the ... tells you are but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor that change his mind about what he believes\nBecause you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about\nGuns it's about something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in eastern above it all for freedom as we define that he mentioned this\nLet's go to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with um [noise] Trump himself\nThis this is this is an example you [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked a\nOn Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews it used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint base business\nWell it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the cotton joint base\nWhere multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked at Fort Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter said Mr President do you think you need to revisit seem\nSo a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill\nAnd the first question a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws\n[noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things [noise] an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd that tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nThe worst part is that the rightful owners of those names never had a clue who he was they never had a clue they were being ripped off until

I'm a ... in your opinion and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in Europe parent's opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic\nWhen it comes to when it comes to Israel\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they but they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but could could have said that they were I mean because what I\nSay that yeah because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think is a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThey're really they're willing to claim the victim had but nothing else [noise] [laughter]\nWell one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how\nA liberal June was like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is this it it it it it's it's a Jewish state\nAnd yet there's there's so much anti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a ... because it's anti that religion is not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's in the religion is high but religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from the religion I don't think you can and it you know any any time you're Jewish\nAnd you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liberal and Israel comes I Know when or if the disclaimer I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything is real feeling\nThat it yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics disassociated with with Israel is a book because if they're inside the religion that's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform of orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see that they're anti Christian too um I don't see them as necessarily\nBeing Sunni Islam\nBut I you know but I think it's the it's the ... I thought\nThat's exactly right this is where this\nIs all headed this is all headed toward atheism in anti God that's exactly what is the unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are the\nTrend is toward atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes Emmy judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there is no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of one's accidental one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just done so how this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nThe old the liberalism the decrease in to Judaism and a rising anti Semitism your writers it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis has been in Pittsburgh did it did it adds to any of the uh discomfort or on is you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah it doesn't I I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there targeting a Jews and the way that they would want to go shoot up a thing that I think that that\nThese are isolated is an incident in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he went he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nUm I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the mid term or anything silly like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people think and they're predominant ... thank you thank you so much a re July presents racial from Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nI don't think\nEvents are going to have anything to do with the

... now after Caesar\nSay dare I say this year I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCesar ... and his pipe bombs none of which exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by and the Democrats are thinking well I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump\nAlluded to the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second events happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\nAnd\nThat's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American laughter people politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political ...\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an\nEntirely different Fitch why did the show opened today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with is\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nEnd of the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it has this happens to these two events come along and they put a this is that this has to be what it is their thinking and they just can't help\nThemselves they start blaming Trump for the
