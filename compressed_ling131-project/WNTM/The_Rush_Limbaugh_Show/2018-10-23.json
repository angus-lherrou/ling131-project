about this it is an organized mob and like everything else in the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the Kavanaugh thing with Dr balls the Ford how bad was structured how that was planned

keep your doctor if you don't like your health plan you get to keep their health plan\nWith Obamacare your average annual premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to dope\nOn winning Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to a centrally be cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they want their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found out of course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was\nLying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about such things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turned out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor

produced by somebody nobody ever heard of cause the unrest that led to the riots and men gutsy knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\nThose are all lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protest\nHimself and Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fool decision about the law is Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting at the two thousand tenet germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWhat would you think about it was great to govern you remember who started or remember\nWho was and he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God like you've got to look up to him but you're you're so far beneath them you can't see you just woken up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where there's great accomplished but rock Obama\nCouldn't create these economic circumstances if his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he didn't want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their

a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes and our stockpiled than I could be for\nThe guy was just an honor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against\nThe interests of the first African American president than the country began its recovery\n\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama they couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when they came to voting against Democrats they did it

what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people will give you a hard time I'd you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two does make campaign\nBut at rally after rally after rally\nHaving the president of the states where people up into a frenzy got attacked the press to me is the the ... the most depressing thing that

from the ledge here you know thousands\nAnd thousands of people who are willing to join in and do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised courage and Ford say for bodies slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho was doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting a good laugh out of it and then he looked at me\nAnd he goes like this like I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to them after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it\nBut to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is looking for um nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty pounds name was let the media

falling for the hate\nYeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show\nAt some conventions setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now [laughter] it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president has it anymore but what is troubling as to look behind it and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as far as to who believes [noise]\nAnd he does it I think because it still works instill rile people up\nDivides us horribly\nYeah oh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake who himself has been rejected by people like you and Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected\nSaw he now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this\nHe does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's Trump knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spending like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake in the Washington establishment never Trump hers have resent the hell out of Trump Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you are which takes me to one piece that I had ready to go yesterday but\nDidn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science but Williams site in his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the ... way back when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\n\nAnd let me give you some pull quotes from MySpace every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating in for a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats have no issues\nThe economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavelli advised\nPrint says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared in contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist for future generations\nThe capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten and\nIs so right on the money they're not have to resort to these charades and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nAnd the whole\nKevin all episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it even to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and\nAmerican Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't care\nLess this is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has none left\nAs a surrogate Lerner says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday left just pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the left only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America it does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftist either no right to alert or at Yale\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood miss they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectuals they hate his love of simple ideas that work they hate\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are interchangeable and worst of all\nShe doesn't have any the olive\nTree except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life is short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself in vans and uses\nI'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity a day but they sit there and hypocritical\nAnd claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate he\nIs certainty that America is decent than exceptional may hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many people\nAre just not right and everybody has to you you just don't wait too you know nobody can be that kind of an open I Am I Know your full of it I Know you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you'd be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that\nThey love it quick vacation they love people see the both sides of the things they he reaching out with the heart they hate\nCertainty especially when it conflicts with their own\nNow back to Trump's lack constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been and unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep his real opinions to himself because he's never had to\nHe never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities\nGuy white swimming\nDoesn't see the need to apologize for it sometimes he's treated women disgraceful you for which Americans left in writer shamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but\nGartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the course most of ... constrained average American that Mr Trump conveys that caution is this unprecedented makes us look band other nations but on the other hand\nMany of

that we as Americans we owe it to these people and what that meant that all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how wouldn't

attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they

Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind

they're converting these mental disorders which need to be treated\nBy professionals are converting them into political issues they're whipping up a bunch of anger\nAnd they're convincing these people that the mental disorder is really the result of Republican conservative mistreatment and lack of government sympathy and so they're going to get even with people are going to get what ever is troubling people fix that are going to punish people who are responsible for it\nThe Democrats used Kavanaugh to whip up the women's vote\nThe Democrats think that every one of their voter groups can be whipped up into action by pointing out the mistreatment of conservatives Republicans or what have you\nThey are using immigration and this caravan mob to whip up the Hispanic vote because they can see the Hispanic voter approval for Trump is skyrocketing\nThey are using the ... story to try to whip up the Muslim and Middle Eastern votes and of course the journalist boat which I don't have to do much whipping up there because they own the journalist boat but all of these issues are being used to focus hatred on Donald Trump\nAnd to try to convince people to Trump is responsible for all of
