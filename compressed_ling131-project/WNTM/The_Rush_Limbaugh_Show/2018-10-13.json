last four I don't see where there's this massive realization that the Democrats are they answer what ails America\nNow the drawing buys want everybody to see it that way so they reported that way in their generic polled the Democrats have\nTheir back to a plus Thirteen margin advantage but then you look at individual races and they're nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise]\nAnd then

doesn't matter where you go every story the drudge for example links links to on his page\nIs a story of the Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives\nAnd there are stories where Republicans supposedly think the same thing is going to happen certainly you you've talked to swamp dwellers you I mean you do hear from a lot of Republicans who think they are toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell what I Know what what what ... well\nYeah I'd like to get an individual polls show nine percent of their nine seed advantage even after the worst happens all that that's getting into the into the English I'm I'm just talking about over all the national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having a dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm only ... people to think that everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issue that everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop us\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with the reality is out a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons heavier heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action now I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party\nCried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats and the media publicly acted on concerned on an interest in and would always say\nA variation of you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population this is what they all said that every Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies there her book signing ceremony\nHillary Clinton who couldn't draw crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows but\nI guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death\nThey would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalties that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and\nThat'd be they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed it upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get in wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen they got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by trust shows them just even now after the cabin on hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points\nBack the Republican the I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight\nThat the Republican to I'll have to find it a buck the Republican governor California is closer than is running if Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have believed possible if the Democrats do not retake the house\nI think\nWashington may be on the inhabitable for a while I think we haven't seen the melt down\nThat is going to happen among many elected Democrats the charges of a rigged election of Russian interference that Trump did it again um anything they can come they are ... so certain they're going to win this\nThey've already banked on when they're all ready planning to impeach capital and Trump and if that doesn't happen I don't

review hey welcome back Rush Limbaugh half my brain tied behind my back as always may interests\nAnd equality [noise]\nSorry last caller Sean from\nPhiladelphia what's gonna happen rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it well let me share with you a headline from\nPolitical Josh just today political story ready for this\nPolitical race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ...\nThere are now two hundred nine seats either family already leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this okay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats firmly order wing\nDemocrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you need for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nTwo hundred and nine seats firmly are leading Democrat I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nPart is that this is ... and ... they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans and I I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington living die by their stuff I'm telling you it\nIs their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other\nThat to nine feet sort of leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine feet firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nIt can you tell me what it is\nAnything one thing a series of things that have American voters so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nation wide ... with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump as a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump but the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans All right well as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind of disgust\n\nAnd then be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching me I mean you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and us you'll be or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nDuring Republican Presidents Day is nobody wanted to go to dinner 'cause they were so mad all the time but she apparently had the best dinner parties at her and Bradley's house\nAnd she was on Anderson Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow Sally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John tower\nThat's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently [noise] Don Juan running around the Senate just better than everybody they got a nice way this guy had more allegations I literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend him while telling him he needed to resign one of them was um [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget his attempt saving the reputation of\nJohn Tower\nI knew John Powell I think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only but I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ... folks by reputation cocoa get a\nPicture that guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught on trying to find one here and show you on the digital camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says that John Powell\nOnce assaulted her but she didn't come forward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John Powell basically tried to sexually assault you in the back\nOf a tax folks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in senator you don't drive around and yellow cabs [noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she asserts that happen in a cab\nThat John Powell tried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was [noise] they nominated the guy for secretary of defense\nAnd that's when all this came out but Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDrag now where did this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and ran out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically I tried to assault and the and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding at I'm senator stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was a general and the army at the time and a cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the car and Senate screech to a halt in front of our corners and I think that in power and got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shot God\nBut I went in the house at night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never told my parents are bearing\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn the assaulted by John Tower um\nBut but you know she doesn't want to hear yeah there's one more by we got Times Square here's here's another reason why number forty three when I\nThink about it I thought I'm so glad I didn't do it because I could have met Anita Hill and Anita Hill's life has been completely ruined destroyed don't went ahead and then going to be the person who is in that hearing having to talk about is disgusting Christians lousy Ford's name came out against her well she didn't want to be there what\nI think is that\nIf I had been Anita Hill and I'd known better I wouldn't have done it if I then Christine ... Ford she didn't expect it to go public but I Would have not done it\nBecause their lives have been ruined it costing buzzy for just got an alumni an award from UNC Chapel Hill for this and she got to get movies like why did the hills life has not been ruined or destroyed Sally\nWorld are you looking at\n'em anyway [noise] ah\n... I did and why the bulls he sent the letter if she didn't want any of this to come out\nJust those I flew to bleed really tell the ER and worst\nHi I'm ... owner of blind store dot com you know I made in my life's mission to convince everyday people that measuring and installing custom lines is one of the easiest do it yourself projects there is check out our new no tool cellular shades the first and only shades installed without any screws or tools\nYou heard me right customs shades butter insulin without any tools I guarantee you're going to fit their own remake the free of charge you only pay shipping save up to fifty percent off any order just under the code Russia checkout lines to dot com that's blinds T.

the fantasy football or soccer jak Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station\nNews media WN can\nDon't mean to Democrats are online to stick to a hundred nine seats but that's how the stories written ...\nThat's how that headline and stories written law they're taught to nine seats leaning Democrats already\nOut of four hundred and thirty five that's just nine short of the majority [noise]\nWhite women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice in the last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept for a very exceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them [noise] this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\n[laughter] ... the left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America\nOn a test and they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course led to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm a poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they have to do\nWas change America\nSo back to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christie on 'em and pour it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton's the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal\n... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrat activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most startling example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't wants to them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ... P. S.\nNot by you in fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere ... did you see any way even a conservative state college where I was speaking to the U.S\nThey said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well\nCertainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christ you for listening to one another working at our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nGet blue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted\nRule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a\nTime for instability is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what\nWe're up against Steve skill lease [noise] who was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice\nShort would sure whether it be that's the standard if the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party world\nUm our world should be destroyed that is just is that\nIs what's called for conservatives and Republicans being destroyed that is the new morality\nFighting back are resisting it we deserve what we get\nRush Limbaugh on news radio seven ten W when GM sponsored by CBC office technologies providing service that can't be copied visit them today at C.
