he didn't emerge meaning he thought\nHe was lord and there he bought something\nCould happen\nAre reporting that here's ... was recording everything that happened functions not possible in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone\nAnd\nApple does and even if if we had a new watch the series for what she didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\n... but even if you get if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought\nL T eve service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch is just a giant red button that you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the concept was no way\nYou know its its maximum twenty yards is Bluetooth that that connects watches to phones twenty yards twenty five hours I'm trying to think on the golf course when I lose the range of phone stops talking to the watch\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards at most about what should be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like it there is no way his watch was recording anything and\nTransmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened to it besides that the Saudis would have seen the watched by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\nThe watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under LT they still need to be fair to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording it doesn't start at you can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device although there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the\nPhone it well the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be\nAt some point put back in ranging connected to the fun to watch wouldn't need to be back into close proximity the phone for his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply\n... it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an iPhone and and to remain paired to the iPhone you can't be more than [noise]\nWish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection when I'm On the golf course and it's\n[noise] thirty yards Ninety feet at the tops tops and this guy had walls to deal with inside the consulate or he couldn't have been that close to the phone which is in the car the families to Dan\nWith the with the fiance now uh [noise] I've got the audio here of James okay if a secret audio taken enough Claire McCaskill and her campaign and Rob Mills I this is\nThis is important because this noise is not being reported in Missouri\nWhich is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state of what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor new ways of the secret video from project beret toss it Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this\nThere are times news have been reported\nSo we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ medium Breitbart News in oak cure report ... there's no way piece here why there is no New York times here there's no St Louis Post Dispatch here there is no Saint Louis\nGlobe Democrat even though they know publisher and fifty years there's no Saint Louis penny saver here there's no Saint Louis TV station mentioned I don't know about Kim election St Louis but we're covering that by me doing it now\nUm there's nothing Yahoo News nothing not one\nDrive by or mainstream media outlets shows up in a Google Search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project verite sauce\nEvery site running this would be a conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers or TV stations here and what it basically is his McCaskill recorded on secret\nVideo admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters the truth\nWhat she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't\nOpenly says that says one of her age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the on identified project Vera toss secret journalist and in this particular soundbites Senator McCaskill\nAre talking about it ... and the project maritime us secret journalist are talking about the second amendment\nPaying only I think we can actually do you think is going on where you are a young\n\nMan\nWere you able to hear of that\nAre you able to understand what she was being asked in her aunt\nOkay All right let me let me read to you because I couldn't if it were I Would not be able to make sense of that or even though I've got a direct audio feed that just sounded like noise to me but here's the transcript she said if\nWe have the kind of the year I think we might have any Democrats winning big we could actually be in a position we can get votes on this gun stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows he just doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house and then it's awkward 'cause all those house members are total NRA folks\nThe Vera times journalist so you wouldn't be on board with bump stock oh of course\nI voted forget it\nFred above what what about high capacity magazine I have voted for most of those they absolutely get rid of high capacity ... ... what about for an outright ban oh yeah and not right now oh yeah\nYou'll never hear Claire McCaskill campaign this way she'll say in fact\nThat she's very open to the idea of bump stocks yeah it might have to get rid of everybody's on board with getting rid of bump stocks but start talking about limiting bags and banning things\nAre really can't say might lose votes in the Boot Hill but you know what she said about that she said if we can really sweep up in St Louis if we can clean up the story I could I could lose some votes in the boot heel\nSo you people in the Boot Hill in Missouri and that's where my mom when my mom was born in Arkansas but she grew up in Kennett\nUh hanging there'll be tougher to brief time outcome I look at this one of the thing I'm trying to remember what I've got here are probably two or three I'll find it during the break here I Can't believe I
