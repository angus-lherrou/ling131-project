couldn't come out to\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh he couldn't define what that meant a there would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transferring America man so what did he claimed it meant was taking on issues like climate change\nAnd health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do was transformed America away from\nOur unique founding converted to a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist back looking there's a\nPoll out here today this from the Daily Caller Jay Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials\nIdentify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taken a [noise] you know you'd like to not believe this but the facts on the ground to just do what you see [noise] even though it may be\nAnecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify\nA some kind of socialist and women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be 'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't drivers socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliant taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt to our race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need\nDo not depend on anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo social is in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennial men

not just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most\nIn a

Pleasanton, California first with Chris hello\nHello red rash a good to talk with you\nI'm this Monica McClain who you were just speaking of the person that contacted 'em as Kaiser on trying to get her to possibly change your testimony ... uh she she used the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how\nAre those coaching going on but Dr forward on trying to get somebody to handle it polygraph\nIt's not a yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Kaiser to change your test those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her son it I mean on her and the testimony she goes she mentioned regal Delaware was where she was at and that's the last known address of of this moniker McLean\nCorrect yeah there's a ... ... that's when they wrote a letter when when one balls the Ford wrote a letter that's where she was she was a ... a Delaware with McLean yeah\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet\nI I'm Wondering if not is it is the Democratic oddly enough or not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\nA\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people that things are going to vote changes it was done when it goes down and according to then because all this is about to come out\nNo it's not about to come out that's the whole point\nYou know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the leeman Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley referenced it and Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of balls e foreign witnesses being pressure to change your testimony and Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's going to change anything this is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence\nAnd if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and it baby CBS NBC began to report on this if it wouldn't change one Democrat Senate about\n\nDemocrats can't delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell the turtle\n... well the question is why wouldn't republic groups make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWhy was it made an effort to ... uh\nUh [noise]\nIt's in the FBI reporting to Republicans I think that Democrats can see it in the ... the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report they discovered it led\nTo my to my knowledge none of the senator grassroots so forth are not mentioned but we were just talking about\nNo no they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning\nOkay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself [laughter] um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure common sense\nYou were sitting there thinking if but when I Know this it would change everything it shows that the ... the foreign side is willing\nTo commit perjury ... born in perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories which then could be said to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they've not showing up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want\nFor ... reason the stories are being suppressed but the Democrats in the Senate no it doesn't matter it's about

Grassley deal Grassley sent a letter late last like Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer you might've Senator Feinstein and in this whether he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e and Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass what his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations you was shortly what producer this quickly is you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial Dr forge allegations\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence but the the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even low balls the Ford admitting that she took a lie detector\nHer warriors did and that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass and we've been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused reduced this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed elect attacked or we want to see it\nThey won't let him see\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed it's a reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not gonna lie detector that she passed the lie detector\nThat she told all these details tour therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce and grass me say your must be you must have something to hide there and he writes\nI urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein and Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my ... and fried Debbie Ramirez Julie sweating represented what what what grass means getting at here how much confirmation if you had with his witness\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them how how much time spent with this witness\nDiscussing her testimony or coaching or whatever I mean he's loaded for bear this was the kind of ... out of the violation\nShouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphone don't intend to the Senate or are they the media\nPeople as [noise]\nUsing by us and so forth in fact grab one of the aisle soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned\nIs the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah\nIs centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about kid in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened\nTo judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to a mob rule by voting to confirm judges Kevin ... before that\nWas during his ah southern for remarks today in favor capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters\nFor promoting this ... as he calls the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that\nThe resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in\nVarious Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like\nThis fit to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I got an email\nLast night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted\nTo know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or his or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be set of Republican political consultant they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a note from last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened out there in these areas she has studied\nAnd she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump to gather now a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six saying that they did sell for very specific reasons\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six team that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful and she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition\nMinute and from the archives the Washington Post February ... this guy was instrumental in the process the way it was the prosecutor\nIn in charge of a
