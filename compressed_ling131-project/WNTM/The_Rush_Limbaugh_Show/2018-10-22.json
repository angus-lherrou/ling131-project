exploit them also deeply concerned with the violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the\nThe details on that story are from the uh oh here's one from NBC and\nThey are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised\nThe stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into my gold claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative\nAbout these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat every bit motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake once stakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nPolitical world it's so damn hard to understand about this [noise] I think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest are being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mess the bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and say to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party has calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nAnd our political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning\nAny thing in the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate\nI don't for somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point

course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nAbout this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor\nThing call out military troops to stop and invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because a positive comments out of ... that normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what window Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you did you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis is what is what is seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections [laughter] what if we can make that case what do you think that people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized is the border if they\nBomb rushed the border like it down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a a house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean are you using Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump since a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way

we are very good a lot of things we're not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one thing throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I'm One hundred percent for putting the military on the board but this one does perils and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about ... this is not a military invasion of talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people\nThat are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of things when demanding\nLife well my God let it\nIn the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nI think the difference is you know when it comes to ... we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're into your sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nTo okay what about this what about just the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and that\nWas the problem that's the perilous form of the problem\nWe're ... you don't you know like you you don't use bullet you use a ... one of the dummy is called I forgot the use use some kind of force but not lethal\nWe have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal like a pig and then there's no we we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president's would be tremendous\nBut the president would be okay so there's ... you think the military showing up is\nLet me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong and interpreting you you think the military showing up as a Lowe's Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they are good that they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nNow that's the ... you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWell then what is it what's the preparation it'd be ... we'd have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then\nOkay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound in since I don't mean that\nThey hold the line I hold the line provide a visual presence a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line at probably with Bush which I'm Talking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens\nWe'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two gotta hit them with storm caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you'll talk guys have a tendency to fold up when they were met with equal strength and we just have to\nBut even if there is a casualty or to the drive by half their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah okay so the alternative is to let them in nope\nNope half to hold the line and and like I say somebody's you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the team or the legalized sleep it's unfortunate but this is what they this was what they take it all by taking this just\nYour own okay All right so the responsibility for what happened to them has to be on them you would think the media is going to allow that this is a job I left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it got to take a break\nLimbaugh making radio rain again you're listening to the network news radio seven\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...\nAnd homemade signs or helped me find them back home prone to my area to handle any kind of project you can read reviews of the pro kick their ability to even book appointments on line ... with my wife love most is that home advisor is completely free do you\nDo it at ... dot com boy download the ... to get started\nIt's people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage your well our investment advice is about you [noise] it's about providing your kids with opportunities for a head start in life viewing secure and your retirement and realizing your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan\nWe believe in you\nHave to investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor find your new steeple financial advisor rich people dot com that's S C I F E L people Nicholas some company incorporated member S.

Democrat candidate\nAnd it isn't working now by showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of Santa's last night on CNN\nUp this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of you in an Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion that guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist and really makes no bones about even just talking about Florida as a collective that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or all collective\nHe hit it would be a disaster for Florida right now to elect anybody like this guy because of what he will do\nIn racking a growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing white gang busters and you and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate\nI and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything for his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses it's like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you to build that\nYou didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible knows a thing that worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nOr in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and now suddenly has become a just a static flat line\nJust a a walking echo chamber for whatever leftist leadership and the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not\nBut the Santa would be great the census is a is a re get night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nIt's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while\nThe trend is constantly upward people have have ah exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me\nExtreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt wouldn't constitute rolling back\nEvery achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you get a better

when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump is supported because he's in the last line to\nHold off on this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you got to vote\nDemocrat because\nThat's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful America needs to be punished whatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life the Democratic\nParty believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nDemocratic Party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democrat Party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want\nBy voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited extremism the Democratic party has become
