knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again a classic expression or\nIllustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remain supportive of\nDonald Trump but that will get to the more details that I ... back to my little test so I rent or these people at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let\nMe let me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many of them are committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back\nTo being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so we want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I spent forty five feet incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are student at the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans will never run before\nNobody knows\nI mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents\nAre no not as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats they have been\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now has reelect and this is what the left and the drive by as are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip and then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course now they're saying now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware\nOf this they knew about the resigned resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter or the American people\nAre fed up and they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump and know exactly what's at stake they're not going to sit home they're not going to twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixty and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today at a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty Eighteen congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected\nTo office and in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\n... member of my great\nBook grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative here a long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained uh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity name\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by media these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading pill movement\nAnd the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red pill\nA movement but\nHe says he's got eight productions here that'll happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in the ... electorate thats unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case\nOr in in the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate\nOr the drive buys would like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations ah the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy our would argue that Democrats in the media think it\nIs a problem\nThere's talk all over Twitter that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco la marrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these these events these falls surprises he\nCalls them we call them October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was ... we know what that was the I mean that was totally trumped up made up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump\nOr we have the October surprises the usually the caravan crisis mail bombs or some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of these\nFalse surprises and other events while intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans from holding the house all of the above surprises and events have worked to enhance the conservative\nRed wave according to this guy instead of creating a building and blue wave and a red wave continues Republican voter intensity exceeds the much heralded blue wave\nYou by the way this is your what a blue wave would be what we need to properly defined a blue\nWave would mean the Democrats win everything they take back the Senate they take back the house by a large number if the Democrats win the house by two or three seats ferns and it's not that's not a blue wave\nA blue wave means massive massive realignment and it doesn't look possible they're gonna they're gonna win the Senate they don't win the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about unreality not in terms of media lingo they'll call it whatever they want\nIf they emerge victorious\nBut all of these events were designed to cause this blue wave weren't designed to create this massive voter intensity and it turned out\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented\nRepublicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away but the conclusion is that there has been no blue wave there's not even been a blue ripple that you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip\nSome blow bubbles are bursting recall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support last time blue congressional districts and major coastal cities so this guy is of the firm belief that\nI'm Scott

I I have at times I marveled that this country is held together by the way it has for many years as if has\nGiven them the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper the U.S constitution the honor system and the ... the respect for that document is what's held us together\nIn all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who wanted it literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason they didn't make it up well it was stolen Russia's this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country\nAnd we may not unify issue to issue to issue but we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nA profoundly dangerous and we are raising him haven't been since the seventies\nGeneration after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've ... we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that job in junior high intramural football softball but nobody won\nThat there were no out in a baseball just you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down and we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we've not gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derive from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case was losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child like snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results of an election\nThat is on going and now on Twitter as I said you can find post Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened if not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out\nI think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\n[noise] who Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kind of disability that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I think reasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are\nAnd it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do and\nIt's ... refusal to accept is not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy I don't feel good and when they feel bad and something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

Chris foster President Trump says he wants to end automatic citizenship for babies born to non citizens in the United states he tells the show asks the oath on HBO was\nAlways told me that you needed a constitutional in that way 'cause you don't want another one you don't need that nobody can just you know very much into well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nBirthright citizenship covered under the fourteenth a member of the constitution the convicted mob boss Whitey Bulger's been found dead in prison in West

weekday news radio seven ten WN GM [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd\nBack to the phones week oh this is Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat get Russia I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment for team because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are running the miss impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's a\n... ... ... it it it it's your we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it\nYet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July Nineteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they pass laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques\nThat essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game then we're going to formally recognized former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that they do sweat coach were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment a few a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be appalled in the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this\nAnd that's his point people have looked into this\nMay have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who are involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten took in first citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties\nPretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here\nTo become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have that they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods are Irish have their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians is that\nYou know but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct in unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization\nThat's what's different now there is no interested in that\nWe don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing if they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population\nBecause modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard or immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be re establishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points that the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question how he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the synagogue surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down we going to come together we gotta do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being Senate that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you ... ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah it'll\nIt'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that the Senate ah\nLook we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nThere there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject of immigration and so Trump and his\nTo ... the only place they can go to the United states they can stop and get asylum in Mexico or some of these other countries\nUh where I I agree with you that if the rest of the world was more like the United states everybody would be better off if the unequal distribution of capitalism could be dealt with and if we had a far greater distribution of capitalism be fine and dandy but the Arab man I don't make the solution to this is enterprise zones\nAnd it was all about door or Guatemala\nUm maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for ... and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another and\nThis was an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's and [noise]\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies going to relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\n'cause that's these people aren't capable being hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand it it'd be one's heart political theory and economic theory it makes sense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise] I looked\nNo wise or George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states\nThe purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done to it to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party\nWhich wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network Hi\n[laughter] Hi yes fresh up here I got my husband and I adopted

shot is that even today I had you know they were came to us thanking Trump pushed the horrible and that when he would send them all back home and and you know now they love Trump and they think this has got to stop and have an escape because my father's in prison for twenty eight year\nOld mother fled the Mexico not of course that's\nA kind of kind of awful crimes against their own children and you know I just think\nEverything Trump can do to stop that he's got to stop it because they they come up and they have these babies and I have another situation I can tell you that way you know our country has caught where they had a Fifteen year old girl at the border seven months pregnant and they let her across they sent the other sixteen teams with our back\nOn my stomach so they can't say we don't have hot they do see a situation they need help but you know even Hispanic girls that\nTrump was horrible that he has to send all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll check them you know whatever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's a once you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just it's impossible support on a little less you have particular political notions of what the United States purpose in the world is and what we owe\nAnd so forth but in in terms of being the best policy for the United states it is\nAnyway appreciate the jam thanks much will take a break and be back at\nThe\nNews radio seven ten WN\nI'm ...

Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed any more because there was a direct connection between political speech and violent that's a very serious thing to do that\nJihad as terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack we always ask what radicalized than what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as terrorists\nAnd you cannot divorce the actions of the second ... from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat smacks boats Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's a very conservative but he's certainly wasn't this\nWe have to answer the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic\nTerrorists you can't divorce the actions of the sick people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nSo what he's talking about is you have in a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to your mom preaching comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the unit so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people Donald Trump is encouraging this\nThe moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs that are being nobody on our side doing this is where did kill us\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they'd been unable to dispatch Trump and it's always\nA one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftist so Hillary Clinton right it's always just one way street there's always you don't want is rooted in bugs it's rooted in the belief that\nNot a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms\nOf this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight was

the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what\nStood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in they never understood\nThat you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat\nWhat all of us had been saying to each other\nBut you you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh damp or criticized made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto

mindless\nThat's been golly you can tell you how do you think are tells you when did it go start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd that we've even got never Trump conservatives

Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats\nAt federal state local level and there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and so gas if if if what the media dead ...\nTo the state of Indiana is gas lighting as if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd er and accept it and it's this arrogance and just the premise here superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's you have\nA synagogue shooting while the obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this is crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal\nWent increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition\nSpent numbers normal are trying to turned everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media is right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it is and it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of whether the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut the\nElectoral results just in the past two years indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that are just as if she was [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
