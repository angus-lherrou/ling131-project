forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women or women went for me\nWhite women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice in the last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being there and so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept for of a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK\nAssassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why this kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy\n\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the lightest and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell\nNineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course led to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they can only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm On poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white\nVoters what they have to do was change America\nSo back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and\nThat troubles me greatly Christiana and pour it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution look to the apps\nThat judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance for the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your\nPrivate refuge you have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal mistake every liberal\nIdea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nIce pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret\nThem and then pronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most sterling example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them\nThat's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats wouldn't Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\n\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional got\nThe ass not by you in fact do Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college where I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned to civility Christianity for listening to one another working out our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of\nThis is that Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time for instability in is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise] who was shot by

people I just got some emails when this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia just prove what a suck up you are Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just he wants to brag he's just doing this for ... no\n... you may think that and I'm not going to try to just ... but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump hasn't seemed to have any real interest and she doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about him\n\nHe does this for a host of reasons but most importantly\nI Believe Donald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants people to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor as of information in this country do not\nConvey proper information about him is there's so many smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rushed but but you are the voice of the mainstream media you should have the best stepping pond yes\nUh should have the ... and ... [laughter] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore\nIt reminded me\nAnd it came across years ago and maybe even you set it uh but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism I just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society is always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle exhort eater trending towards civility or barbarism\nOff the clocks and the oh it's a constant influx and\nSo what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\n[noise] well uh it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working\nUh you know towards the law and order a restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their character assassination attempt on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact and most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all gotten fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word or whatnot when what were they what were they light when the Democrats were the Democratic party over your dad or your grandpa what what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time they see a issue was a labor laws and a\nWin for what purpose\nBut my point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point\nThe Democratic party has always been a rooted in the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in anti capitalism\nHas been rooted in pro socialism and big government they've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone all in on the militants and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be Mitt work around the iron or anyone can use radio\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work\nOur medical bills exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars met his share members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how it could have done it without measure\nIt's so worth looking into there is the reason is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.

Fox\nNews alerts hurricane Michael makes landfall on the ... the strongest storm ever to hit the Florida Panhandle just shy of a category five boxes Evan brown tracking it live from Miami\nSo my point is that that not as many people are seeing that men and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell you folks and I this was the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation will powers at all\nYou can't miss this these people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous\nAnd they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people have a great time these are people that are up beat him happy they are excited to be wherever they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally and your average ordinary democratic protest is striking\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was it was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with unforgettable picture to me\nThese kids slowing at the front door\nOf the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon right I see\nYou again banging on the door and clawing at the door trying to get him\nI didn't know if I was watching the wicked witch of the ... army or what but it was it was\nCertainly nothing that was inspiring or promoted one and you'll be part of the Trump rallies or the exact opposite\nAnd I don't mean that people at Trump rallies or a bunch of nerds and dry balls don't misunderstand or just wholesome people and they're they're having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event\nAnd even if you do have some happy people and the Democrats sponsor the audience isn't gonna last long because a Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else checked off\n\nAnd I want you to hear a little bit of a Trump rally last night this is it's about ... minutes worth\nThe Trump rally crowd has find a way that found a way to recycle and keep lock her up relevant and current about Senator Feinstein this another [noise]\nUsually the documents well\n[noise]\n[noise] no no no we [noise]\nAnd I\nThink that don't get about five and can you blame [noise]\nWorst body language on another words did she get a hundred percent hand your mattress during our son is and you don't give power to an angry\nLeft wing mob and that's what the Democrats [noise]\nYou don't hand matches through an arsonist you don't get power do an angry ... oh by the way that word mob\nThe left is is in thin that Trump is calling their supporters the mob and so now there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss or on dictionaries in the wake of PBS and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats are just in didn't end up and did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so used to having it thrown right back at him with the same force they'd dish it out they are so on you used to having their ideas and behavior being criticized\nAnd they really can't stand being laughed at\nAll [noise]\nSo now Dianne

com the Republican House is in collapse\nThat's the story that I had the headline that if you didn't know how to read it you wouldn't think that two hundred nine house seats are all of a sudden switching to the Democrats' side\n\nAnd that story predicted didn't predict it said we are in the midst of a Republican collapse in the house\nThey do not change everything is so formulaic they are so predictable\nAnd predictably wrong they're doing it all over again and they're doing it on the same basis that everybody hates Trump\nThat whereas in two thousand sixteen it's impossible people are not going to vote for this guy that has become people regret voting for this guy but I Can't believe they voted for this guy and they can't wait to show up and apologize to America for voting for this guy so they're going to do and the only thing they can do and vote Democrat\nThey were wrong in two thousand sixteen some of them as we\nMentioned earlier this ah this is a budget booed couch gay warning that there is a red alert out they're Democrats in may not be looking\nAt a red wave [noise] ah here's the picture let's\nSwitch to what I got a business which are the dental came now this is if you're watching on the digital camera and I'll I'll get this up to cook us and we'd have the website as well that is a satellite photo from goes sixteen I Believe the weather satellites\nOf hurricane Michael\nAnd you can see that it is in terms of its total area it's not a large storm it's intense as it can be it's a category five\nBut if it does not\nThere was a as a meteorologist sent me a note a moment ago Nineteen eighties hurricane named Alan\nThat covered two thirds of the Gulf of Mexico and again the sensitivity here is\nIs due to the fact the media is hyping this and even the weather service is hyping it because\nThere's a course of political agenda attached\nTo climate change and all that so I just wanted to share with you a set photo that was sent to me to show that it's tempting storm but it's not even by historical standards among the largest every member real intensity\nGulf Coast warnings from five to and I have we we can use radio seven ten W.

Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior\nMayor told\nElle magazine and her recollection of the Thomas hearings Jay's yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing she ran uncorroborated\nStory to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless\nMy attempt to explain this\nThe first story that was run about ... nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found it so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that was Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from ... Ford or be it for Ramirez or from ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat\nOut admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it you know we needed to show a pattern here is Krista Smith Ohio your next I'm graduated high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you thank you um so I was just wondering I was concerned and money to get your thoughts and Internet fun of it yesterday but with his\nMom rule as it is and Hillary claiming\nThey're paying neatness civility right now I'm\nI just get worried with the\nMom and the left and the accident and then fattening or if they begin to talk people\nUm it just had me worried about provoking violent and um you know to the point where we don't do anything for a child and firing of it comes to creating an armed guard on our cars because we truly are the silent majority we're not out there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Mobile", "day": "10"}
