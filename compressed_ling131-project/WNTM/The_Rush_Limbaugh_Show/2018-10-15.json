I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important watcher and in our lives and that's why it's not\nIt's just not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and the agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing if you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the elections uh the the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they have it everybody hate Trump and so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result polling data and says the media so hey it's Trump they want everybody else to\nTherefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have a white and realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks of the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in the history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get ...\nFor the tactics they have engaged in from the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAre just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sane society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump\nAbout suppose or the hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nI I mean what the hell I we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but they don't want to teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union why it was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is hot and yet they shot hostile sounds hobby you know some of the way they\nTweet us ... somebody can in daily winning in this country for so many years I Am willing to get rid of that western alliance now I like they don't then is fine\nBut you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO can protect you and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade and like and it don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so well once again we have here the concept but it's just so hostile hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational\nAnd of course in the eyes of the left we want to be in Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still\nFunctioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves\nAnd this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises which say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in the history combined\nPutting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you the loan them you write\nThese radio seven ten WINZ GM and use radio sevens and I've gone\n\nTo a minor correction it's a it's a variety in which the effort\nBy Leslie stall is ripped to shreds not Vanity Fair it's six of one and a half dozen varieties not so much a celebrity focused rag against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comment on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is uh just another sample from last night Trump\nAnd Leslie stall\nYou know General Mattis that TLC the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances in St prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time\nOkay yeah I Know unless you have to try again I Know and my answer is this I Will always be there with nano but\nThey have to pay their way I'm totally in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage\nOf white and general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you\nHe's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining\nNATO Trump already called her out on it for doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the\nOf the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less we still trying to do here that's what they don't get they can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got at the roster coming up probably do he said something to her that is as as honest in true as anything you've ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerating in some of the things I Would tell him but my opinion is that the media he said to her I had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president\nI had no idea I'm being really serious with you he said and I I think\nThat's probably true as a New Yorker and emerged in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York state I made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kinda like McCain was\n\nSo when you send to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised by this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but thought he knew\nBefore he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you and I did but now since he suffered the treatment he fully\nRush Limbaugh them\nThe\nFees for follow up on the look on that little N.\nPay folks the IRS does not mess around you know this they have the power to take everything your bank accounts your paycheck even your home in business\nNow if you own back taxes it's about to get worse the IRS has added a small army of private tax collectors and their job is to find you to track you down\nYou need to call optimist tax relief they're the good guys the experts who do this best\nThey're experts in the fresh start initiative that's a special IRS program that could save you thousands even tens of thousands if you're qualified\nOne call can start the process to stop the demands letters stop the aggressive collection actions optimum has resolved over a half billion in tax debt for their clients they\nAre a plus rated with the better Business Bureau call for your free consultation now it's free call once you have options eight hundred nine seven three Seventy seven hundred eight hundred nine seven three Seventy seven hundred\nLiving enjoy mobile bay developers big loss can be your\nPeople were not talking about millions appear people hear\nIt otherwise it and and the top fifty percent of all taxpayers pay Ninety seven percent of total individual income tax so in other words the bottom fifty percent pay three percent there isn't much more you can do to cut their taxes\nAnd yet how often do you hear every pot both parties politicians\nRunning around and we're going to middle class after it was a middle class pregnant burn through brand but we got to cut middle there isn't much to cut anymore\nWhen it comes to weight income taxes\nNow which small percentile of tax payers also paid\nThree percent or more it's fourteen hundred taxpayers\nThe top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth\nOf a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone paid free point two five percent of all tax is one thousand forty nine people is the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty which is a little round that to fourteen hundred and\nFourteen hundred tax payers paid more than\nThe bottom Seventy percent\n\nIn two thousand one and the bottom fifty percent pay nearly five percent the top one thousand percent pay to point three\nSo the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich\nNot decreasing\nIt is not true to say they are not paying their fair share now this\nIs as it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce income tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll be more inclined to pay it\nPlus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more is actually part and parcel with the theories behind\nSupply side economics supply side tax policy but the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that's fourteen hundred people for gene hungry people out of three ... some odd million is it fair to\nFourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt is\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever gonna change\nBecause if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything you need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent\nSo you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they're getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the left ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fare has so much more money than you are just not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share in taxes and we're going to ... bottom Seventy physical yeah baby punish them\n[noise]\nCNN's Chris Cuomo the son of Mario the pious\nSaid that\nHe thought Donald Trump look like he was thinking racist thoughts listening to Kanye West last week\nThey repeat that\nChris ... of CNN\n\nAfter playing video of Kanye West\nTalking just Trump in the oval office said he didn't care what ... said he wanted to know what racist thoughts were going on in Trump's had\nMy curiosity was it about what came out of ... miles of my one daughter went to what's going on in Trump's head let's take a look at him here is my educated guess okay other than a warm serotonin flash of happy hormone imaginary headlines and black loves ... blacker than Obama ... sad\nWhat other kind of racist thoughts as Trump may be happening here is Kanye goes on so is the racist here\nThe son of Mario the pious who sees race everywhere all the time even when it's not present even when he cannot pinpointed\n\nAnd my house in an educated guess Chris I'm uh I'm thinking that you're going to guess you're in an hors ... west ... speaking Trump is thinking this is great this is great this guy's blacker than Obama this guy's on my side this guy's going to do wonders for me\nHow does he know what's going on in Trump's then\nYou have a crystal ball\nBut no he's not racist I\nThis is the kind of I think it's I Know this is not going to be widely known until I tell people about it\nBut I just who these people are and the things they're saying and doing I I just\nI Know they're going to get votes I Know people are going to support him befuddles me though back to the Trump sixty minutes interview with Leslie stall we were up here at number just as a big number three\nThis is Trump talking about the necessity of consequences\nFor illegal immigration Leslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their parents\nHas the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books by painted and enforce that line for them who launched that zero tolerance policy [noise] tear families with children and then everybody decided and of course you don't want ...\nRation and frankly when you don't do separate when you allow the parents to stay together okay when you allow that then what happens\nIs people are going to pour into console you gonna go back to that cat in the west is Leslie\nFor coming into our country illegally\n...

you don't use her\nLook Elizabeth Warren is resurrecting the one drop rule or an antebellum a a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop of blood was black you're black\nOr this was this was a grotesque school her her percentage are so small\nThey don't have to excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nWhat that's exactly right intersection analogy requires quantification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany it against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives it was about her future lunch she needs to tell her base\nI'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of across or to\n[noise] would you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists\nConcept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that let\nGlad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than welcome to find a good host I remember that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that book uh intersection routed comes straight out of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on a pressure or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl of heritage\nAt its later is now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare ... so what you are how oppressed and how much of a pressure you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being\nOne camp or the other gets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's red intersection out it'll be\nFor me great on wash your you're talking you're you're speaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes an intersection out I mean it's basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA ... with that with militant Islamic lists that then with illegal immigrants and their activists and we're all of these people intersect is worried about unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this and there was recent white privilege stuff pops ... absolutely\nRight so now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press\nShe's asked him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever when I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa\nWell that doesn't mean I'm going to

just\nPray just submitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor\nFor the Afrikaners are not black\nUh I well I\nI I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks down okay All right\nI just wanted to ... because a sub Saharan this is somebody what ... what is it what it was it and then you
