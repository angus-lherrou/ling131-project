longer [noise]\nBother me other than the I I I Do get concerned that there's so much genuine ignorance existing now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe has destroyed the futures\nOf way too many women\nIt has just distorted the life it's distorted gender differences it has distorted the concept of happiness victim allergy it has distorted the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\nAnd it's to and feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question we had Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself and twenty funny or Eric Holder the attorney general for ... same\nAll involved in many scandals himself\nAnd I'm seeing a lot of people on our side and these so called conservative intelligentsia shock that Eric Holder was saying what he said you know Michelle my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high and holder said screw in that when they go low meaning Republicans when they go low we get\nThem\nSo people's mind God he's out there inciting violence and he said no no no I didn't mean it literally\nI was saying that we can't take it anymore we have to stop being a nice guys and stopped taking it and he didn't mean it\nObama method when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun Obama met at sodas Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people would get in our faces they mean that\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators they're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why\nWhy are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe recited a poll indicated the house races are over there are polls said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house\nIn their minds they almost won the Senate they have the Mueller report and the mother report is going to link Trump to Russia right they know that Mueller's got the goods all they can taste it oh\nOh 'cause they can scratch their bags with it they just can't the aid and all that Mueller has secretly collected the goods they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's kind of tight Trump and Russia and it's going to prove the trumps stolen the election from Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\nWhy all the desperation CNN\nEngaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism and directed at

just trying to cover up for it\nAnyway you people are observe it out there I got another email rush could you explain to me this journalist named ... show gee\nLet me it's ... and ... if you I mean granted if tell you what I Know about this and it is it is somewhat there's somewhat fascinates name as your mark a shell game that the president of the United states involved in this now Trump is being openly asked about it and\nIt has to do in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow Jamal ... is Saudi I don't know if he is related to add ... ... is is\nA as a Saudi or Arab name and then your show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity\nBy a\nA lifestyles are the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer and that the source of his wealth which was made to look\nLike a jet setting party animal by Robin Leach so whether whether ... related to him and I couldn't even find outages habit Jamal ... as a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin some on as the crown prince\nIn Saudi Arabia his father is the king king ... he is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons\nThere are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son and he has the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he hasn't been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next king\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the some of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and a oil\nFocused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends\nIn the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know he's winding dying the Google guys is winding dined Facebook guy but a lot of time an apple he wants to build a brand new\nCity out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two if he takes off the Arab\nGarb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a really attractive short little stocky\nBut he represents if he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he's the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without male a company that is made him quite controversial he also last\nSummer not this past summer last night and it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite\nOf Saudi wealth some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it do to corruption\nAnd connections and storms he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ...\nHas as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin Salman\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it\nThis reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont despite\nThe reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep\nYour head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees\nFor example\n... wanted to get married\nHe had to get a wedding lie a marriage license he was in Turkey in order to do that by the end it before the hidden supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi royal family\nBecause of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul\nAnd hasn't been seen since\nHe went in to get a marriage license he was wearing get this he's wearing an apple watch his I found that was connected all watch was outside in the car with his fiance who was outside waiting on him to get his marriage license to come back out then they go off and live happily ever after\nNow do you think this guy is going to vote for this guy is obviously going to vote for the nearest democratic and finding this is how they're being inspired and further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring\nPeople to vote for them because of the great improvements that will have it in their lives Nancy Pelosi [noise] right here\nNancy Pelosi Trump's tax returns a top priority if Democrats win the house [noise] now how is that going to benefit your average Democrat voter well I'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters\nDemocratic voters want revenge not a job not raise non a bonus they want room ... eight Trump\nAnd so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promise to make Trump suffer\nYou think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise] I don't believe that the country is that it ranged but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is\nOkay to the phones ban in Fresno Europe for us today great to have you with us or high\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was going to be the uh for the three days of the non than last week I saw the the the screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so why was this is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan if\nIt's the only game plan they have and they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to claim there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same ... and the look in their eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right loses when were silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters and certainly conservative media a well some conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working that's for rats lying\nYup threat flying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs if we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discourage jumping up and up and make us not go up that's the only way they win but if Republicans conservative\nStand up when every single time we\nJust have to show up we have to convince other people to show up you convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you were in Washington for three days what did you actually see what kind of activities really engage like you saw I was\nI was right in the middle of it I Would live

W in [noise]\nAt the top and bottom will be our breaking news I Want to reveal seven ten WINZ out over you and I are three Ninety nine point nine W ... three mobile\nOn Wall street ... he's been critical of the central bank before and President Trump is criticizing the fed again is too aggressive after yesterday's sell off blamed mainly on rising interest\nDuring a live phone interview Thursday morning with facts and friends of president said it was more true in the past when he was first setting himself up in Washington and he just trust to members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people who doesn't like are there some I'm not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that ... this is not coincidence\nThis is not happenstance\nSo ... and Trump both are putting staff in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to it I don't want to jump ahead what's going to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams sorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise] this is Trump\nCalling in to Fox and friends that I was talking to Steve do see a do you say you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nI really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time either making decisions on my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has not affected at all by it we had it under the great control I don't think it's really\nHot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people have lined up they expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do what it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on\nThe commitment\nSo the next question from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote\nFor you Eric Holder former attorney general said they go low we kick him and the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics\nTo be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you you better be careful what he's we're discussing safe and for him to make a very dangerous day for older what has held in contempt by Congress colder when after Christians he went after our\nGreat evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case\nA holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to talk to like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans a whimper away or not even acknowledge porn or they would say\nWe strongest term ... we'd denounce rhetoric go out and buy a attorney general holder written but but but much although totally totally uncalled for and we we were keenly a unilateral condemn it\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] that I can tell you that I could he'd better be careful what he's wishing\nNow the stock market's been kind of see song has been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump\nIs suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy Democrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am\nConvinced would willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would they would incur some pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it it\nFlies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe it looking our polling data people\nObviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThis great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the republic\nIn the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent [noise]\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression it was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with plenty of money he was it was very easy [noise]\nI'm paying interest at irate because of our fed and I'd like our ... not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well\nThat traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great my whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why and let's look the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so for renting\nTwo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think the fed is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy at the time and totally unnecessary Fort right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump ... know you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of Tommy leftists as they are as many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning because of drunk\nSo Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election is why things down so they react\nTo it and and this roller coaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I think\nThere's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ... heart\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are working are there are some that I Am a not at all with yes and what we need them out slowly but surely\nAre have been some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not links that made up by the newspapers the meat is a very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand\nNow even a letter written to the times that there is a chance there was a very good chance that that was written by the time so I wouldn't be surprised because at times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear that right here\nWho was the first or maybe the only person to suggest that the times itself wrote\nThat piece that memo that some pose a memo written by an angry staffer\nIn the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal as the president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservative they we loved it\nAnd they started a massive manhunt to find out who did this\nAnd they couldn't find anybody and I think on the first day on the first day we'll have to go back and check the transcript\nBiting it was the first day I told everybody\nI don't believe this I think the times made this up I think they wrote it and they're telling us that somebody ... wrote it\n[noise]\nNew York magazine and look at it as Obama had a secret plan in case Trump rejected the twenty sixteen election results\nIs is not a wary of looking back let's let's retrace steps it was the last debate between the Trump stir and the hill the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them would swear pledge to accept the election results\nAnd Trump said no I'm not gonna sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes in and we've counted the votes\nThey want it\nI think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for\nThose who have you with knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election of course I'm a great American ... that go to at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win a landslide then they the soundbite would be the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat the upcoming election\nBut Trump crossed them up they said no [laughter]\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans these people are gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight\nHillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy where your memory\nDidn't believe is saying there's this is an unwritten sold them Obama we didn't know until recently\nDevised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump Williams to steal the election away from him\n\nIn October two thousand ... senior staff and the Obama White house\n\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had cause to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be rude during his mind a little bit was Clinton on October the nineteenth you said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded\nThe I'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical Ben Rhodes Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligence just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\n\nBen Rhodes seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo laser rice to try and forestall a political crisis by validating be election results\nSo this is not funny looking by their hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and ... and\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents\nAnd they were going to get them to validate the election result\nIn addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get Colin Powell and ... rice\nIn the event the Trump tried to dispute that Clinton victory they would have fun resolved as well as the conclusions enraged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed\nThey hatch this Russia plot way before the election even took place\nAnd no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're going to use it\nIf Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that was going to validate her election even more\nThat was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the Olive Garden she overcame Russian that's what their plan was\nAnd then it\nGot turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russian stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama\nThis story New York magazine they think they're doing an anti boy here they think they're really praising Obama they are admitting that there was a conspiracy behind the scenes dealing with this election and trying to handle whatever outcome\nEnded up happening\nGulf Coast deals are more popular than ever because I hard radio listeners are saving half on regular prices from
