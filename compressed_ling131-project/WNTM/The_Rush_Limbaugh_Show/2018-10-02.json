God whoa what what does that tell you what what [laughter]\nWhat what what's going on\nHarry ... are so many races that are within the margin of error\nMissouri Nevada Tennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have a best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the Senate and the house and if that not in the house\nRepublican away in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment up the Democrats get the house and don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there because they would never vote to ah to convict\nIf the Republicans hold the Senate or even swelled the ranks so the panicked host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red wave in the Senate\nShe says there was discussion of a blue wave being generic battles advantage for Democrats do you notice it tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans but you know there's a lot of talk all with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republicans but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening in the house races\nI'm In a Lincoln little scientist observation about this but what did I tell ya he's generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then you know nine months ago the Democrats\nHad a twelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning ... Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of 'em and Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host of been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything me remind you\nOf a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I but I Know one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have more fun we're going to watch a horse race he had videotape of a horse race that nobody had seen it was not a big race is not allow the players to make friends leave that send away Andrews on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bats and Donald ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that much ... stops and it's a halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds\nAt the final turned ... stops the type of horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've made\nLayers do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to when you look what you were doing you were making ... guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is finish\nYou never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime of third quarter finish doing your job\nSame thing here polls in January in front of the

October second CNN is panicking\n\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've had\nThis in in in the

be a blue wave in the Senate but wave red\nWave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about fine old her in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August\nWe don't want anything and we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day

for those of you watching on the digital\nCamera I Want to show you something for those of you not watching on the digital camera going to post what I'm going to show there's going to camp at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see if they're\nA but first before I assure you there's there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed the cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it in a sweater let's let's use that one first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right speaking\nOut against ... there was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at some local talk shows but CNN's the only cable out there is no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media\nUh aren't really conservative websites or start everything's starting to to to to block it at that point but but this program nationally was still in four years after\nOur founding and Clinton have blamed it angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the\nUh building in Oklahoma City the federal building and of course uh I I was living there was not going to accept that would challenge the White House on and they issued a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio this is the by the way there's more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize I Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brecht that was his name\nDrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble\nWas a cover on time magazine ... the artist that his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nOne of the local host of the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air\nWanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties at the Oklahoma City bombing the fire was a no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh and the fire\nHouse well that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kavanaugh I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of the ten year old daughter\nSame cartoonist is back [laughter] some public at the Illinois something Illinois journal or some such thing but the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter in parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching other that'll camp this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside the description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another prayer\nAnd in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says they're gods forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr forward\nNow as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do as a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot com or if you don't have to remember you'll be able to see it I'm not doing this was like come on for membership I'm I'm just we have the ability to show these things rather than to describe them\nSame cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's just vile\nIt's filthy it's dirty it's disgusting it's despicable ended sick and of course it has accomplished it's subjective it's gone viral and people have seen it\nPeople are reacting to it and I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets and I decided to go ahead and do it in my never\nEnding quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor\nOn the left\nThis is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh cabinet his daughter says another\nPrayer dear God forgive my angry\nLying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise] [noise] and it's just it flies in the face of of decency\nYou know you run out of descriptive adjectives\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people\nWho at some point in their lives have suffered psychological and some of the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic party and and the American left psychological disorders have become the identifying issue isn't characteristics of this party\nThese rallies would be urging Trump to drop Kevin offering a secular party and the second Trump's presidents that was the exact opposite\nSo don't dumped me on this on to what these people in the media have so much invested in their power\nIn their self esteem related to their power and that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurts them to the quick ... disturbs them\nAny time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upsetting them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about it as I just did on CNN NBC News desperately\nTrying to convict Kavanaugh at the same time they've been trying to convince Trump colluding with Russia NBC News his hand to admit that they are unable to independently corroborate the claims of Julie sweat ...\n\nOn the table to independently corroborate what makes claims and has not spoken with anybody who says they saw sweating Nick at parties with capital they can't find anybody can place or there\nBut she says she was at ten parties where Campbell on his buddies run on rape trains gang rape trains they can't find anybody who saw what sweating it was a college student when Kevin on his buddies riot school students everybody's asking what's a college student female hanging around with a high school a party for and\nWhy keep going back to the gang rapes if that's what's happening these parties your lawyers center that\nHer lawyer said that she was doing research\nYeah Julie sweat and they kept going to these gang rape parties\nTo gather evidence to do research but NBC and believe me there looking NBC can't find anybody\nWho says they saw sweat Nick at parties with capital Kavanaugh has said he doesn't know sweat Nick and his called her claims\nA farce\nEx boyfriend\nSays what next threatening to kill his unborn baby was exaggerating everything look Julie swipe Nick is incredible just like Christine foreigners incredible I mean when told me about a year but\nBeen through it a thousand times for nobody she says was there says they were she doesn't know where when she doesn't know what she said afterwards or how she got home she doesn't know anything other than to have it all there is no credibility in either to sweat like\nSweating isn't credible Ford is a leader Feinstein is not credible the Democratic party is not credible the media is not credible\nThere is no credibility on the allegation side of this entire Kavanaugh story\nLast night on Laura Ingraham show on Fox News\nJulie swipe next ex boyfriend or Richard Venice see details why is the third Kavanaugh accuser is unreliable ministry says that swept Nick never mentioned having been sexually assaulted the em\nThe ex boyfriend who Julie sweat Nick at third woman to make uncorroborated lure read the allegations against Kevin all told Fox News that she had threatened to kill his unborn child and at times even bizarrely ask him to hit her\nRight after I broke up whether she basically call me many times and at one point she basically said you will never ever see your unborn child alive\nRichard fantasy ex boyfriend said that last night on the Ingram ankle according to Venice see so what ... told him at the time I'm just going to go over there and kill you guys\nSo I think as represented by Michael ... who didn't immediately respond to Fox News requests for comment but in an interview on CNN Monday Night he cast doubt on the boyfriends credibility in characterize them as an a strange ... ex\nBoyfriends\nNBC again we can't corroborate any of the claims made by Julie sweating it can also her claims have now shifted\nSweat mix said she saw boys congregating outside rooms but well I didn't know what was the current wait a minute you started out saying they were getting wage going on right now she says I don't know\nAnd she says that

frame and their ... parties and I would not take one of those classes from\nOur cat I'm fat cat locks game I saw him around the punch a painter is I don't know why he did that I saw him by them\nWell

I don't mean to be redundant but Dianne Feinstein all of a sudden this afternoon bringing up the fact that we need to start looking again at his roe versus Wade decision women's reproductive health and is assault weapons or a thinking on why\nThat's been that long ago and you didn't have anything to oppose him there so you imagine how they feel about this\nThey bring their fools to believe this was real and the first place but they're so damn desperate [noise] uh [noise] one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon wife is number not Sheldon Whitehouse disguised money this is a Democrat who\nOn friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the gate in ... he figured this could be the gate where the incident Dr foreign described it happened\nAnd he is thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that camping all used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward Kavanaugh so on good\nMorning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking to Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they haven't been given free rein to interview whomever they want and that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to get this done by friday of really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have grab audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles that Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen we're looking at his credibility now is grown adult\nAnd if you believe Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get the robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying by Kevin ... perjuring yourself and that means he's not quite on what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rapist nasty throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nHe is a a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer\nYeah I think friday's fight yeah there's not too many people to talk to hear FBI's got a lot of shore where you can get this done that's just to central maybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kevin ... in anything\nUh there's one more [noise] that I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise]\nThe question of who leak Dr Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein you know this this\nIs of leaking this letter my memory and this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the foreigners ... judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter holding it up or talking about it\nI remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about it and said that she had it since July and\nShe told us all about it that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it she's holding this thing I don't know what I don't know what to do with this\nI was all part of a strategy so\nYesterday afternoon on Shepard Smith reporting um a Fox News channel trace Gallagher was sitting in for ... Smith\nAny have the legal affairs correspondent for National Public radio on their Nina Totenberg said Mitch McConnell said friday he thinks the Democrats won't agree to limit\nThe scope and the FBI

secret\nAnd I managed to find out about it I found out there were probably a hundred people in Washington this secret and kept it for a very long time you and I are not stupid people we may not be
