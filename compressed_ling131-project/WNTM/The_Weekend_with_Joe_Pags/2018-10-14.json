powerful outlet it used to be that if you if you follow somebody you solve their stuff every time they follow judicial your stuff every time then they started employing something they call an

her attorneys wanted a show trial you know they wanted to make a spectacle of her and Brett Kavanaugh and that's when they got they they they they weren't really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what are rich resource you ought to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed to sway but that's what her attorney\nIt did to her yeah it's a center on John seriously right last question on Kavanaugh known them onto the on affordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question he's now on the court and the left the screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him\nI mean again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their Montreal we're not going to kick them off the court because we're so unhappy that he's on the court\nWell was there an angry mob and they they've been\nThey've had this primal screams since the day after the election when the wrong person according to them one you\nKnow I've never seen his like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of honey room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taking on enormous task growing hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous insecure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage this ministry from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican the grace of the Wisconsin let's talk about the unaffordable Garrett ... use supported the president as that all Republicans and has been all Americans because their paychecks are bigger and\nAnd do this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually help the people of the major amount of people that were paying that find that taxi an Affordable Care act were middle class people that were harmed horribly you guys had a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of pre existing conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you were a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you'd like health care planning ...\nFamilies who have their previous reduce probably five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen lived here right beside it'd be the two thousand Eighteen live here or there they're pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to four days which is they weren't or Obama yeah and then in addition to that allow companies to offer every new ability okay so so you give people a greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates and in Wisconsin for example health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost or by Medicare plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year you know they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks here you may be only pay a thousand so I didn't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back to the Obamacare\nExchanges if you could afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the\nThe vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums caused because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to something you set a second ago and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something but just really reiterate that for me center if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of covering for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do it through regulation right so the ... the protection terms or preexisting conditions you can always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't\nGet the subsidies that can't afford they'd been priced out of the Obamacare exchanges we're giving them an option debate out to be able to afford\nHealth insurance for once okay ... this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of uh the short term when when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as it is the only because we're on the one single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise based does that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protection preexisting condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nOr they think they can win the election but no I mean there are a long term goal obviously is Bernie ... Sanders your Medicare for all which just which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts it tore his single payer government run bureaucratic system that will ration care\nWill reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right and that's the only reason only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs thirty eight trillion dollars everybody's individual income tax for at least have to double business taxes at least double and they still won't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching to write down the number thirty two trillion they realize how much money but as a Senator Ron Johnson a one last question I run a rose reshaped the access of the time and You're welcome anytime I friend um when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned it briefly\nI feel strongly that ... percent it stay with you guys but you might gain two or three I'm not I'm not predicting it's already should stay home everybody should go and vote certainly but the house is starting to look like it's up for grabs were this blue wave was being talked about for six months\nDo you think that the moves by ... Feinstein and and uh and Cory bookers barbecues and all these people in that process\nWhere do you think there's going to motivate conservatives and Republicans to get up off their hands and go and vote November\nI sure hope so I don't I don't know ... what else what else can Democrats show the American public to to just create the discussed again if you're not disgusted by their despicable ... behavior God help ya\nYa know I'm I'm with you and I think that it's going to be probably I'm hearing people saying red dawn\nOn on on November or six I'm not really sure what's gonna happen other than people need to go and vote or else it surely will be some sort of a strange blue wave with impeachment talking all this other garbage Ron ... million for the time I always appreciate the knowledge and thank you so much for really straightening out with this individual health ah this individual's\nChoice and health care really is because the lines are going to continue for the next month and you know that\n... day review appreciate that Ron Johnson again he's a Republican senator from the great state of Wisconsin always read information and we always appreciate them taking the time your thoughts on that hopefully it cleared some things up because there are some things in the media that just frankly only true they just they just darn\nIt is a eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe ... dot com they're either yours [laughter]\n\n...\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty\nLeaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

for the ride so talking about a ride the stock market as we took a bumpy ride some say a roller coaster some say just went straight down I'm the president calling the fed logo\nI guess I guess that's the issue I'm not even sure what that means but whenever it's a visual markets thing or financial question I always go to my friend Doug Adler use the managing director and senior vice president of investments room of dreams that associates or Doug I always appreciate it how's it going brother\nJohn great thank you so uh all the president has to say that the fed is logo\nAnd that we get eleven hundred points to the negative on the stock market people obviously you're freaking out some of them are dug you know me I think the stock market is a slot machine anyway some but I don't really worry about it my four oh one K. still looks great today um but people are freaking out about can you point to one thing that made this happened ... conglomeration of things\nYeah I think it's a conglomeration of things Joe it it's always interesting about the market is things that we know that are potential headwinds\nThe market looks at it stares at it shrug it off drugs it off and then suddenly it matters and I think what's kinda manifested here as we know that the Federal Reserve is on this trajectory of raising interest rates so\nWhat does that really at the end of the day designed to do cool off the economy so that brings into question next year twenty Nineteen what earnings look like\nTrade or China looks like a tough or\nA photo if you will and in this regard so that's\nProblematic we've had a few companies a pre announce their earnings which don't didn't look necessarily great\nOil has gone up the you know that's I'm up to Seventy five now it's pulled back the last couple of days like everything toward Seventy but still it's a much higher than it was Eighteen months ago I had went on the economy should have some of these things that no those have all been there but suddenly they mattered and people that sell button\nDo do you have an opinion it's Doug handler managing director senior vice president over at the gym that associates David opinion as to why the fed would want to cool off the economy\n[noise] well they have this in a state it inflation\nTarget of two percent going here and then when you start to she mentioned oil as an example there's other places we can point to that are that are showing some inflationary pressure which is part and parcel of course to a stronger economy in this economy is much stronger than it was when President Trump took office right you're getting some of those pressures\nFed tries to stay in front of that because you\nYou it's kind of like a you know the old porridge three little bears story they don't want it too hot or too cold yeah they want to just right and so they're trying to do that meaning a slow things down into that sweet spot where\nWe have reasonable growth but maybe that's three percent with reasonable inflation which they're they're Damien to be two percent so that's that's why they're doing it\nIs it rational or reasonable Doug of a I heard today somebody may mentioned that there's a rumor that the left is trying to do this before the midterm election if the if the Trump ... tank ... didn't work all those the tax cuts and all that stuff is it reasonable rational depicted politically people can make this happen\nUm that that's a stretch that's a pretty big stretch um think about it if you're on that side of the political ledger you're kind of hurting yourself\nRight if you're right ... thanks go down I don't see that yeah\nOkay a gambler he's managing ... vice president of a investments of regimes that associates\nSo as we watch this you know Obama when he was in office when I talk to you about this before we started so he doesn't pay attention to the daily dry rations of the stock market or when it wasn't doing so great in in what he was doing great he said look I've read I Am I'm\nThis of course the left politically is saying well see the bubbles burst for for you know sixteen months Eighteen months almost two years now they've been sending the bubbles going to burst this can't continue like this\nDo you think this is something temporary and it will correct itself again or are we seeing that maybe you do get too big bridge bridges\nYeah no I I think so investing the one thing that gets lost a lot of times is people either think it's a bull market or bear market and they have an opinion based on how they feel about things\nBut really what it it's a probability business and so if one were to answer that question by looking at the probabilities I think you say this fat some deregulatory reform that's positive we've had tax reform massively positive\nWe have an economy or that had been held back because of the consumer and then very low in terms of their confidence in the outlook All right now and this is actually right we're at twenty year high something like that in consumer confidence I think last week we hit an all time high\nSince Nineteen sixty nine for small business confidence so when you feel good about the prospects what do you do you open up your wallet and in that regard I have to tell you this is really\nFor found two things first one is\nThat service so that's just simply what comes in and income a into a household and then what goes out for obligations like student loans car payments mortgages credit card debt okay we're at the lowest level the percentage of income and go into debt service has the lowest\nOf all since the mid seventies and household net worth in this country such assets minus liabilities it's a hundred trillion dollars a hundred trillion although I'm Hi yeah\nSo if my debt obligations are low if my wallet or purses is full of cash as it's ever been and I feel good about things what's the odds that I'm going to suddenly just stop spending money because the Dow drops eleven hundred points\nWell it's not affecting my spending that's a great question and it's interesting but you bring it up that way because I think it was two months ago maybe a month ago we were hearing that big box stores are reporting better sales and they've ever seen ever restaurants we're seeing more people go out to eat than they've ever seen the big scene in two generations so clearly people do have more expendable cash", "show_name": "The Weekend with Joe Pags", "year": "2018", "city": "Mobile", "day": "14"}
