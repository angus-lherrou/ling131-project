America great again bomber which is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case what you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him demographer bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter at the congressional baseball game the Sanders shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do\nThat's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news as as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\nAn incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been reported to use a white guy with a beard\nAnd ... also was reported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy lists himself as Native American his first name is Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well and also a report that he's a talented Filipino\nThe media always the quick to say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman\nThe guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of 'em in in self defense he shot and killed them they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was just panic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to your straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have out of Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like it's some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected anything here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made them do it according to the media sends out a\nBunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced they were really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we return addresses on these fake addresses on the actual send to an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about Trump did this\nI guess there was some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact that sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump\nYou if you were a make America great again hat your target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist in Islamophobia has either fall but that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for\nFor ... and that's okay that's perfectly fine fake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAre there is an example of for example under example of that\nBut the media again playing the victim in fact Jemma concept from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or engaged over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind this is a guy\nWhose job is supposed to be to go there to report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost in in in his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be ... or the president you don't get to tell the president ... mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrated violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice\nThey should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nBut this is elected reporting abuse the desired by the media to pretend like\nOne side is inciting violence and the other side is that it's just a crazy person that was on his aged vats irresponsible that's responsible or\nBy the way that the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian is family or a family friend or a lawyer or somebody claim that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded Italian first name certainly sounds Hispanic\nWho knows what he is when we do know is he was some promoter for chip and bills and some bouncer at at a bar even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the the leftist trying to glean from him and put it on Trump is irresponsible and stupid and the media needs to learn it's job again the job is\nTo go there observing and tell us what you saw is not a drug or observing and tell us why from caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep

County Arizona he is a right they're separated by an Indian reservation but right there on the border\nAnd deals with the illegal immigration all the time I Want to know how he's preparing for the caravan heading this way and and what exactly it is the law enforcement is willing to or has to do as it gets here a sheriff I appreciate you how're you\nDoing great thanks for having me on\nIllicit always appreciate and really had a good time with you at the fair get together in Washington DC\nGot some great knowledge I have to wear my cowboy boots next time I played a shrimp um six want to do for his standing next to you but ah it it was a great time and really great knowledge I Love the way you guys there in your sheriff's department\nDo the job and especially you know watching you out there on live TV I saw out they're interacting with people in the community and I love the way that you take the job on a lot of people I've seen police officers you know guys like this to\nWho walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't think I've seen some who I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to two\nI'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together but at the same time I I Can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm going to see at the store and these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what his wedding it's gone on in their life to put him to this point so I tried to treat everybody with dignity and respect that we've tried to go in there now they escalated\nI don't have a problem escalated as well but I find that humans can attract more flies and then you can then ...\nSay ... and in watching you interact that again the sheriff mark lamb from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking to my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you figure percentage you can put on this where somebody will not get with the program not understand but you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police but is there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is for most police officers I mean for me it's probably about ten percent of those\nAre difficult to deal yeah and that you know I'm I'm a believer in calmness and power if you walk out\nYour calm and they can feel that they don't feel you're wrapped up it just it really helps that situation go a lot smoother event you have to arrest it ended up going to last year but there's some people that have just like you said from the word go they're not with the program and that you can tell that immediately\nWhat I've learned from watching you would share of mark limping out County Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like lie PT and others um it is that when you walk up you generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was\nA but again if somebody's going to get with the program you'd probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on them and but they're also minor enough to where you could still get them home tonight I mean that's it's kinda it's\nI didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\nJust relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently than you think if you just stay calm was work through it um and it does get us the ability to use some of that discretion but you're right and if we wanted to we get stuck on a ton of charges too so it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nWhat reaction do you get from people in ... county the residents there last question mark and appreciate\nThe time or what reaction do you get from them when you say if and when they get here we're going to make sure that we we you know stick to the laws are in ... is there a sense of nervousness among the community now with all these people had no way\nYou know we're very supportive community because we deal with it so much you know in this county everybody understands the majority of the people understand the immigration issue where with\nCars running from some ... almost every night we're dealing with the drugs coming into our community are you being affected by heroin it by a by standing on by these other drugs that they're trying to get our our American public in our youth flipped on so\nHere in Arizona and here in our county will get it for the most part you know and uh so we get a lot of support and they they expect out of the I was voted into this position on those grounds that I was strong on border security and protecting our community so we had a lot of support from our up from the people in town\nOr good is it they certainly very good people and they certainly have a great share of sheriff mark lamb but al ...

Republican Kevin Brady he's the guy working on tax code ... playing with President Trump or we talked about the the the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke\nAnd also about what is this new tax cut plan that we keep hearing about him and I appreciate you how are you\nA good joke thanks for having me on\nYou know what what an incredible time we're living in right now I Want to get into the incredible succession the positivity\nThat came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI shows was this idiot but sent out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what do you think yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously this guys had a history\nOf uh of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening to blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do know this is a person that ah frankly um and I don't know what to ... how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a low on right let me pick the lord they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it and again it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a A R e ... advice early on and said you know someone's ... stopped talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that the exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair what one last thing on that um is there any changing how the media is doing this or ... bomber the cold and you know how to get bomber meet new people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice and almost killed these college they didn't call him a\nSanders shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here\nAnd there is and I will tell you a jot play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes no in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took some a swing so do you want to take some ground or is the second I looked out\nThe was take them now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shooting so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is\nAll the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine wandering Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama in ... we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens\nThey made it happen I mean we we'd like to see them camp down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy that did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know I it is the the year where frankly President Trump or can't even breathe right for some people criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished and the fact that it's thirty five forty years later\nThe media looks back in ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating Trump horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point what thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan\nPerhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that to redo that the economy for decades and and the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nA record in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success yet the media again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair or it'd be the success that we're seeing was fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your jaw I Want to come on but I only been up two minutes and you're like you you're\nYou're breaking pencils him going crazy with a with a um a all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow\nAnd all of us every American who pays taxes got a break every American to pay taxes has a bigger paycheck many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are now manufacturing stuff here again or promising to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success\nThat we got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing and tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas or manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and and and in in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest economic recovery
