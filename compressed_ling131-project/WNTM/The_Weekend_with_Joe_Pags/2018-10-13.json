good job in commando with Arnold Schwarzenegger anyway she's made that decision and the left media the legacy media in this country\nListens to what she has to say and is like now giving her greens if he hears the odds then\nAnd the whole thing is odd but Louis among those involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on and somebody is presented as an expert on something like I'll have\nAn author on are all have a geologist on are all have a an actor honor and I'll say this is an actor you might remember from is this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um here's the president's son\nYou'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person\nOn some of the networks they'll say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the person is getting paid for your parents or an analyst generally speaking you ever going to do with the human presenting Alyssa mulatto and they never said why are we supposed to listen to her\nAnd address illicit mulatto says we need an equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on at USA Today I'm I'm confused why are we doing a story enlisted below into\nI don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights in equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment then Christie lousy Ford would have stopped the Kavanaugh\nNomination an appointment and she's never really said why\nAnd again I don't really care why ... why she's not an expert\n\nI talked about this but I've talked about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes that people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or on the big screen for a long time\nAnd we set ourselves well\nWe were you for some reason project intelligence on them\nA list of a lotto is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about\nNone she has no clue she has yet to make a point that makes sense you get to\nThe legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think\nThat she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers in general Americans I guess where the dumb people out here like a like me\nTo buy you into this far left wing garbage listen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not not doesn't help their side they think she does but she doesn't when it was the lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people like you and me say well I'm definitely not going to vote that way look how dumb this this\nThing is that she's saying or looking at taking selfies or taking videos well sitting in a very serious hearing\nOr look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman 'cause every woman who's telling the truth when we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\nThey don't misunderstand me and I said is from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously but you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe in once it's proven\nBut there you go you turn on the job or or you read you know some of these current events websites there's Alyssa Milano\nAnd they never ever ever never say why we should believer you should believe all is in a while because\nFilling the blunt just doesn't happen oh another trending thing that's happening today which will boggle your mind is Robert ... robbery ... of course the Confederate general who lost and had to surrender to to us rent\n\nAllegedly if you believe NBC News of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio and praised Robert ... period and their story and of course\nThat's the only period into storage your legacy media that lies to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert de leite on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in\nUlysses Grant kicked his ass\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\nNow the media knows that but they also know you don't know that you all know that the\nPresident said it that way so if they say the president praised will Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised rubbery layer will be telling the truth yes\n\nBut it's also a sin of omission or reliable mission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nCan I take out to a section of that and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praise Robert he leave and left and waved to the crowd ... it's the best thing I don't even get on my my plane they'll go back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a liar [noise]\nA better thing to say it might be what he really said\nUlysses Grant was so freaking good vetting kick this guy's Ashley this guy was really good\nThat was the context but white tell the truth when you can lie and then correct it later and by the way on social media when you lie under your your

the weekend with Joe ... and I'm Glad to have your own for the road or there's a lot going on this past week\nI was able to connect with a therapy with yesterday ... the former governor of Alaska and also the former Republican nominee\nFor vice president of the United states it was very interesting how it happened and in our show to tell the story in the interview we were able to connect and are you hoping you're watching as well as listening and if you're not go back to the live stream we watch it because the sheet ... beautiful in Alaska but do we do with boys and girls or ability or our ya\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole thing like friday and the people know I was actually on this was unfolding on me or love you are listening but I was telling them what was going on\nAnd and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew who should high ... often and I'm listening is what is a good point they should ... you've got a famous name and correct me if you're a teacher was you remember what you said you said it's really me I promise [laughter]\nTo\nGo back and forth and I can eat it oh\nMy goodness somebody is cognizant of the fact we get pumped a lot in your health we get punk so thank you for doing that and know it was funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in Alaska listening [laughter] I'm trying to get up and I'm like I Am I trying to verify it me\nWhile I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email back from sure appealing dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet but you guys couldn't find and then finally I just said you have an iPhone ... face time you must you settle this once and for all and it's a good as we got to figure so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd phone having my own work by that time out of the vehicle and we're all press a button to try to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out 'cause you press the button you took my first time in ... her son Tina Fey that's her that's out there you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sure I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator\nAs a write in really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican IQ support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she says you couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except ...\nKnow and go back even further\nFrom her writing campaign ad after he lost the primary up here remember what's her dad Senator Frank Murkowski after having served twenty two years in the U.S and he gave his daughter the job when he was elected\nGovernor up here right there on charming and I ran against him into heated him read that at least got and that's how we had stayed in the central command once you're in\nAnd you have these special interest from around the country right up funding you you know you shouldn't have to have to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no I'm\nIrrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that that vote again cabinet because as you point out\nShe said he's good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know\nAbout called law courses and whether either good matter\nYes I'm so no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor with this kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as you suggested as an outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska in this country I mean it comes down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its grass having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate but you but you are you like wasn't up and I sort of record of appeals in all ... opinion of course the\nFormer vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all run person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain was going to write in my mother's name until you got on the ticket\nAnd then I voted for you so I think a lot of people actually did that the point of me friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals\nThe the um the more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost every week it would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment check amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment temperament for Alaska what do they make you think\nThat that's exactly right and Joe I was impressed because nobody else was talking about that but there what her action was was essentially bolstering the Ninth Circuit had she had her her weight and that's the Ninth Circuit outta Francisco right now it's about injustice and\nJustice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so\nFor me to be messing around with that uh that was that very very dangerous and the thing is that\nA Trump President Trump saw the light and is allowing an ally in decades of the nation understanding what Anwar has\nIn terms of resources

I'm reasonable rational Americans which is the majority we say not\nEnough is enough of that and we're going to get in there we're going to put government back on our side get it off our back we're going to follow the constitution constitutions all about\nLimiting government that we can govern ourselves and I know I think people like you have the guts to be out there every day in the arena make

around in Alaska\nAnd listens to my program every day we're on it you know in an acreage industry which were ... years and we're also want to know in Fairbanks but the heavy object to talk to her and she really does have a similar if not even worth story been cabinet does because capital where to put up with it for three weeks or days\nWere Serbia was had to put up with it for more than a year and her family to the microscope and just to\nThe craziness from the left him and Bill Moyers showing up in Alaska her perspective really made a lot of sense to me and I look I Hope she runs it if we were ...\nLisa Murkowski's in my opinion do not represent the people do ask her what she voted no on bread cabin on the reason was because he's not the right guy or the right time which doesn't make any

is what you end up doing your will destroy innocent men\nYou will try and do you use every dirty trick in the book because as far as that can set\nIt doesn't matter what I Do it to another human being because I have to have the power and that was so important I I couldn't put this in my book you know why we fight half about they came out but when the president stood out\nIn the White House two days ago in front of the world\nAnd pulled out the Democrats for the evil things they did the justice Kavanaugh and thin pronounce the innocent that was a historic moment because justice wicket chambers was innocent Seventy years ago so is justice capital eight year old man who the Democrats tried to destroy\nThe name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies going get five copies giving to your friends and family inside Dr Sebastian Gorka ... yeah I\nI read the audio book this time so the whole book on the order of ... me with my funny acts that\nIt's not funny at all ... that's going to sell a billion copies everybody wants to hear you read the book so go and get that as well get the audio book as well so so let me ask you about this ... this whole idea from the left that that you so well said and actually talk to my my friend who denounced as soon as about this as well he goes back\nEven further even before World War one and World War two where this sort of fascism has been known to be on the left we just have pretended through history that didn't happen\nThat way but but let me let me ask you about why we're so successful and I have an idea as to why\nBut but I'll ask you more more specifically\nWas it so successful because the right always cow town gave in\nAnd again you just have outlined it incredibly this president said I'm not giving in this justice Kevin ... decided I'm not going to give it I'm not going to allow them to do this to me but is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because the right always gives in and pull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I saw when I was in the White House so I I I had very quickly I developed the reputation the White House a lot of people especially the press department said I I Am it's a strange one why because I refused I just refused flat out from day one to talk to\nThe the fake news I I didn't know whether it was washed the post ... ... and it I said no why would I tool\nThat people who wish to destroy this president I'm ready to talk on record her off wreck or the trouble is\nThe majority of the establishment until the Kavanaugh hearing\nThe majority of the establishment the geo peace than it is that the the the bureaucrats in the in the White House they want the joke they won the approval\nOf the New York times why they want the approval of CNN this is the problem and you know why that is so ridiculous number one they wish to destroy us look at what they've done for the last two years and secondly who cares\nAbout CNN yeah the you know I I Know just because of the White House book as you know how many people watched the most quote unquote important show on CNN every night and this and\nTo ... I have no you know how many people know OK so Sean Hannity crush it like he is the ... yes he is the king millions and millions and millions of us every show Anderson Cooper the star\nOf the Clinton used that work Monday Night his show gets six hundred thousand ...\nAnd that somehow they're showing record Dr Gorka how how is it that people and you're right people on the establishment right people in the swamp on the right or afraid of what Anderson Cooper will say about them\nRight we have three hundred and twenty five million people in this country ... less than half a percent what's what's Anderson Cooper if they were paying thanks to ... and we now they we now do they pay if they were paying the CNN to be broadcast in America's airports that'd be three people including\nSome who are watching this show it is is what we have to break the ... the approval of these people but I Know what last friday did you watch the press conference by the Republican senators who ...\nWho was actually in power and yeah\nThey were angry I have never seen them so angry at the Democrat so that is costing behavior so you know what I think something's changed but everybody\nBe deadly serious the midterms are the most important election of our lives don't take it for granted go to vote take your friends to vote if you like the last two years and you want six more we have to win the mid ...\nHe is Dr Sebastian Gorka the name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies one last quick question I always appreciate the access in the friendship thank you and Phil show and I said all of her friends as well I'm a ... when it comes to left versus right politics I just saw an article by the hill\nThat says that millennials overwhelmingly are liberal leaning left will vote left I also saw another recent polling I forget who the pollster was but it's a real one that says that suddenly the G O P s even things up for the race for the for the house of representatives\nHow do you balance that zero fear in your mind as there is a little bit in mind that these young people will go and vote like drones for the left they don't know why they're doing they lean left um and that will somehow counterbalance those of us who actually have\nStudied these things that are more middle age or a little older that will go to them not to go to the polls to how how do you counter balance that you have a fear of what's going to happen in the house\nLook I I'm a happy warrior like Reagan I Am an optimist I think we can we can we can take ... we can keep the house keep the Senate the millennials are problem if you look at the victims of communism foundation they did a poll that said forty two percent of millennials want this to live in a social\nNoticed that they didn't know what what is but but\nBut you know there's two reasons for a number one\n... a lot of millennials just don't vote ... this is amazing gun you chew called Austin ... he goes by the name of flickers on ...

[noise]\nAll the good there we redesigning the website Go check it out also\nThe blaze radio network it is the weekend was Joe ... glad to have you you're always led to catch up with my former governor the governor former governors great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America no and you might wonder well what does that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked to about bad we're talking about liquefied natural gas are you going to end wars well ... how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know taxes but it's a it's what are called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I can see their travel\nOn Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa to be over in Europe and be over in Asia and then back home base it on your back over Indonesia we do know that that was good until all of us are\nNot necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution runners odd that occurred in the United states\nIt makes sense in hindsight that would be in all those markets because it's you know we're now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent as groups and uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there\nUh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're a you know were regulated at the permit process to smooth and as a\nUh as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know as a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world\nAnd the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry\nSo I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and delivers the president hasn't and he's putting it on me you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining you know good he's putting terms is going to ruin trade and in no time slabs\nBiggie you stepped up and said we're making the deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade him in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas\nNow are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the deal how does that go down\nThat have he obviously talks of you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet or the as the secretary of treasury\nThe notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross gale have a a a role to play in that and and absolutely there's a there's there's good and a correspondent back and forth a\nAnd a ... everybody's on the same team I Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons you know\n... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] sure [laughter] but it's true and and and the point\nIs that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes and what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen if I trade ya and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals where he comes to a certain really hard stuff made me think about with you\nAnd then a young and came back in here\nOr after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs and retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know ... heads blew up when they announced the tariffs to originally with China\nAnd then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a\nThey now that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese no they'll lose a trade war with us so you know\nI've just where their biggest customer they don't want to screw with us\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want to stay in our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights but good neighbor\nYeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you're in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the great guidance of a great guy but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape\nAnd there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries\nWere you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it is these things were outdated do you think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two as radical side\nThat was twenty five years ago and and think about where America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who ... a a developing a the energy\nSources that we were buying and now I'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different positions then we were twenty five years ago so makes a button that good sense that the president was that you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now\nMy family has fallen in love with giving silver dollars as a gift from mobile bay Clinton fine jewelry
