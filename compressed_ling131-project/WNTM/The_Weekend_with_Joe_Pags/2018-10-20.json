needed new blind I knew I could save a ton of money if I put them in myself but I was nervous about measuring right and then installing them that's why I went to blind dot com I heard their ads on the radio or the number one online retailer custom window coverings\nBut I still had to install them so I called them I designed consulting Carla she talked me through it all from picking the right blinds to installing them class online design consultation was free samples were free shipping was free my looks perfect\n\nIt turns out I started new story this morning that nobody one what was the mega millions\nOr is it the Colorado with bell when it was\nNobody won the billion dollar jackpot\nNow it's going to be one point six billion come into what the hell is going on one point six billion dollars can you imagine that would be nuts that would be absolutely nuts are let's talk about Elizabeth Warren\nElizabeth Warren for decades has been claiming to be a Native American or as I like to say American indian why am I right when it comes to American indian because the individual tribes actually call themselves Indian tribes\nIf it's okay for them it's okay for me she's going to be an American Indian uh Cherokee in fact\nFor admissions to school for applications to jobs she she has been listed as the first\nWoman of color to be a professor at what Harvard or Yale or something like Harvard\n\nShe's been making this claim but there is no verification there's no proof she's never ever given\nAny bit of evidence to suggest that she is in fact an American Indian so the president like he's apt to\nHas been name calling her because it sounds so stupid he calls her Pocahontas I think it's funny as hell people who are offended by it are very smart and don't have a sense of humor\nYou know like Rachel Dolezal who's white\nSean King who's white\n\nYou know they're both pretending to be black Elizabeth Warren it seems has been pretending to be an American Indian\nWhat's your well because my cheekbones proves it no it doesn't prove anything in fact thanks though\nSo president been calling around he said you a DNA test if you could prove to be the urine Indian I'll give you a million dollars or your favorite charity so she I guess secretly does a DNA test\nGet to the test back\nAnd gives the results of the Boston Globe which is the far left wing left is the outlet\n\nAnd they write this big story that she proved that she's Native American they say there is a there is a likelihood of up to one in thirty to chance or she's one thirty second Native American\nTo as little as one one thousand twenty four ths Native American\n\nAnd then the Boston Globe and how to four hours later updated and corrected and say well\nThe most you could possibly be as one sixty fourth Native American and the least is one one thousand twenty fourth then when you look into the actual test further it turns out there was no comparison of her DNA to DNA of American Indians\nIn fact the only comparing that was done that was even close was was South American native tribes\nAnd maybe she's got South American blood or maybe South American native blood\nBoth the probability is one one thousand twenty fourth is this not only didn't prove that she is a Native American Pittsburgh that she's not on average the average white American\nHas more Native American blood than than Elizabeth Warren that's a fact I mean making it up it's a fact\nShe's not an ... an American Indian she's gotten benefits for pretending that she was she just thought she was going to prove the president wrong when in fact she proved yourself it it it\n\nShe is so not American indian that the Cherokee Nation has come out and asked her to just stop now\n\nOr when they did bad some left wing cable news outlet called the Cherokee Nation racist or a [noise]\nJerry the Cherokee Nation is races were selling a white woman to stop pretending to be part of their nation that's the world in which we live\nGood luck that's thinking\nThat anytime you go through this week's fixing that lives with Warren proved to president wrong that anybody go through this week and I think to yourself as well she will use Native American and by the way this is not a story any ... any of us should even care about\nExcept for the fact that it's an abuse\nThrough lying to get benefits that were meant for somebody else but nobody was talking about his nobody cared about this and Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas herself decided I'm going to go and start this whole thing up\nAgain and you ask yourself what she's thinking nobody nobody was thinking about this report a second yet for some reason we had to have her thrust\nOf this in our face again why decided I had to do a a a packs power to you about the color Pocahontas all have their free will come back if you don't really with my ...

Eric Trump to sort of a president Donald Trump you're absolutely right but I say I watch these races it's very very suspect how the Democrats are running what they're saying use in races across the country you remove all the advertising you're saying\nOh well what Trump gave a tax cut to his corporate buddies Ted Cruz give a tax cut to his corporate friends the top one percent up a vast majority of the tax code everybody else got nothing that's alive that's not true everybody who pays taxes got a tax cut and corporations who employers got a tax cuts are all making more money some people get bonuses so\nHow do you think about the law is when you see them walking around with about it\nHonestly they are truly some of the most dishonest people in the world I mean I I I've never seen anything like that I've never seen deception I've never seen the dishonesty and politics again this is this in a world right where is this people were not we don't we don't come out of a ... a political world\nThe people who are truly be most dishonest people in the entire world I mean you look at the amount of small businesses in this country right or you know dozens and dozens of millions of small business and you write all across our\nOur nation they're getting they're paying Fifteen Percent or less in taxes you look at the regulations right I mean the way he's flash regulations it's promoting manufacturing coming back and people are getting hired that's why you have three point seven percent unemployment is ... you have the lowest Hispanic unemployment the lowest African American unemployment in history\nThe lowest female unemployment in the history you know what I mean it's it's unbelievable it's all because of of of that right and you know negotiating trade deals where\n... you know this better name but you'd have a trade deal with ... with with China where if you said the product to them they were charging twenty five percent twenty five to fifty percent and terrorists right right where they can make the same product over there they could send it to you and we were in charge of anything so I mean\nWho do you think's gonna win that battle I mean it's absolutely unbelievably uh we we over tax companies we over regulate it you know companies as soon as that disappeared\nAre that the economy of this country went crazy I mean ... it it it's going through the roof are they the stock market this morning last time I looked at it was four hundred points I mean we're doing so well as a nation and we're winning but people have to get out there people have to vote you have to realize the lies and deception\nThat some of the other side and and they do you know why because every single time they open up their four one K. you know where every time they open up their paycheck or when they go to pay their taxes and they see that they have a lot more money in their pocket and they have jobs and they're they're not working two or three jobs and that they're getting pay increases\nBelieve me people read through it and um I I think we're going to see that in the midterms but again people have to go out and vote\nIt's Eric Trump persona president Donald Trump ulcer jumping national interesting about what you just said it's all a hundred percent true we've got companies that can afford to give us bonuses three to four million people go ... or give us raises millions more people got ... a small businesses are adding employees instead of flushing the with Obamacare alone\nBe slashed employees because there was a penalty if you had over fifty employees who your father made promises that he's sticking to it when it comes to the trade stuff\nCanada said no way we're gonna do it then maybe the deal Mexico said no way we're going to do with them and made a deal do you use it in a way we're going to do with them and made a deal so your dad being punished and humbled by the media over the leverage that he knew he had when it came to the terrorists and stuff like that it all works and then they don't give them the praising the Bakken how weird is that\nWell how about health care costs I mean the same thing or a or a Obamacare rotating Obamacare Obamacare was the greatest disaster in the world to be able to\nKeep your doctor you're supposed to be able to keep your plane you're supposed to say twenty five hundred dollars healthcare costs you know flew through the roof and that's all coming down you see all the new prescription drug\nUm legislation that Russia's drastically reducing the price of prescription drugs you you you look at a right to try you look at so many of these different efforts and you know that's right because you know the politicians had been stuck in a mindset um their entire lives and then they don't care about actually governing they just want to keep themselves\nAnd uh and I'm proud of him I'm proud of everything that he's accomplished and um he's awesome guy having you know him but he's just an awesome guy and he is doing an incredible incredible\nHow he really is a it couldn't be more correct about that Eric Trump to use the son of the president also Trump International or do you ... you're going to be in Texas who and let's let's look up and let's let's sit down and talking into go Ted Cruz would it be pushing for tonight after the debate and or in the next Monday again to Houston we

way the debate happened between a rubber phrases Beto O'Rourke who's not Hispanic at all but he's a Gemini ... I'm In Ted Cruz and it was very very telling the media reported as if Ted Cruz somehow lost and they're so wrong guy um\nWho actually it looks like I'm\nSkies knew somebody dynamite gender give his first name or do you remember the guy's name of the movie something out of my hole in exactly right you kind of looks like do without the curly hair\nIs actually a me out there right now but but people are sending around a buddy called cruise a lawyer and cruise actually like backed up exactly what he was alleging about about a ... some voting history or looked shaken to me and I'm just didn't do well\nPlus he's received thirty eight million dollars a lot of it from outside of Texas is a lot of it from the far left in Hollywood and elsewhere\nAnd it is now said that he although he's like a socialist he's not going to be sharing that money you're spreading it around to other Democrats but he's got many many issues and Cruz is is I Believe are going to be pulling your way so we'll talk about what you deserve merit Trumbull and his wife and later in the program much more to come on the weekends the writer we're\nTo win\nMessaging ...\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business degree to further your career and gave you access to world renowned faculty\nLeaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in Salt leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

and do the job he's a businessman he is smart when it comes to negotiating when he's been able to do in in many different respect what hair of the trade um\nHe really great at that and I knew back then he would be great at it um\nSo for me it was a hundred percent and again I don't think anything prepares you for for all of that um it it it's so much bigger than any of that but that's why I think although we all get attacked all the time although the president and different tack every second of every day\nNone of that for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and if we have to take a couple of things going on here and there and the president\nUh you know take that every single day more than any of that it's totally worth it because I really think the country and hadn't been the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest president the country's ever had\nA disagree with that as Lara Trump or her husband his or her father in law is the president I asked him back in twenty sixteen or because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expected that the media would come after the delivered come after you guys but not like this\nAnd I asked him was this completely unexpected he said no I knew that they were trying to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty and forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper on their television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you been in the media for a long time I've been to newsrooms for a long time as well yes they lean left but I didn't know was going to be like this\nSo when we when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I actually held for a portion of the campaign working at like one of my job in television and I ... it became very frustrating for me to work there because I Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's\nNot what he said you know any bad right arm that that way it it it wasn't very clear wind any that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for forever if you know he became president right\nBut um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant they they attacked my unborn\nChild needs graves that make it is a ... you\nKnow crazy but again I think it's because they knew before that I'm trying to become president that he got in there there was no turning back and he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life is going to come to an end though\nI have to say that it it's just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... of any family you've ever seen in my life is Lara Trump or ... her husband and father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate\nFor Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything unless people go and vote in Texas where I said you've got Ted Cruz the incumbent who is doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your father in law a very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being Jones from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know these are far left wing socialist this guy O'Rourke you look at places like Michigan or Debbie Stabenow has been there for three decades\nAnd it's time for her to go now and you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get that senatorial seat this really is going to come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now\nIn the country to get off the reruns and go vote I mean it's really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I think you right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling a campaigning I Will be in your neck of the impact on Monday youthful\nI Will be on the day I radically in Michigan um they do still important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and that's with a lot of people against and even people want and don't party sometimes money and get it right\nAbout what could happen if he had a coach the people behind him that voted on by\nPresident and and really pushing the younger forward we can do much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what they're showing them look like they look in Venezuela right now\nThat could become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put him to get into foreign it's really very frightening\nSocialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are raping people like that since shock everybody to agree that you knew not only are going to get out and getting them at times but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote\nOn it it's very area and I know that it felt like a fight and twenty pain to get Donald Trump elected in ... certainly what the fight isn't over you and you can't come back we can't relax we can't be complacent me happy to get out\nTo vote and put people in Congress or we're going to vote with the president\nIf if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to them because Susan ... his wife was from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting it is there\nI mean there are people waiting in line for foods and the government officials will show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first is made him in the country could as horrific and you really do have people in this country\nOr cause you Cortez ... you've got people who were actually saying this guy Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go\nLower last question I really appreciate your time and by the way I'm Glad you're in Minnesota we go for great stations there we were very highly rated in Minneapolis St Paul MTV okay they're hearing you right now um\nWhen you look at the fact that people on the left are saying volition will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cuts you can take more of your money away at will drive jobs out of the country that's what they are running on and the factors there almost fifty fifty right now in almost every poll you see\nWhat is it that we're doing wrong un I Eric it done junior the president the Fox news Hannity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close that is crazy to me\nWell I don't know that it's really that I mean we thought how accurate the Cold War and ... and a great point that I don't\nReally think that if that is out there I think there are people that are afraid to tell a pollster that call them our coaches them on the street that they want to vote Republican because the media and Hollywood and done\nSuch a a number on on people whenever they come out and according to president or as a Republican I'm no I think it does make people a little hesitant to voice their support sometimes but when they get in the voting booth\nWhenever no one else is looking when they think about the ... where we come in this country and almost elected in two years under President Donald Trump through and they think about their children in the future of the country I really think that they're going to vote Republican and um it's just a matter of getting people out and encouraging people to get out and vote falling here\nStar to your online MBA information management or business analytics master's
