Institute out in California great conversation\nComparing the media and how he treated Reagan and how he acted back to them with how the current president President Trump is acting toward the media also ... will be off the top of the hour yup the former communications director for president Donald Trump\nWhat the hell happened they're easily on the job for a living days we'll have that for you to write none of the phone lines delivers day alone welcome to align one each Lisa in California I Lisa\nHi how are you I'm living the dream which I Would have\nBeen calling um I actually ties into what the last caller was talking about um went shooting how how would you get that\nCircuit typically forget I mean there are a whole nother story in our movie theaters and other other churches ... how would you get that at church hey action sort out\nThe bad guys from the gun or a good guy with a gun and I'll tell you I'm a great guy with a guy you know and I certainly when I go to church I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility to not only protect myself but anybody that might in there that might come under attack\nAgainst the bad guy with a guy you know\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry a church is a ... that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to ah I live in Texas so loud too many places but at the same time they are also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that point if you're going to\nIf you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is this if you're not going to allow me to carry my gun in\nAnd you should but if you're not going to allow me to you better have protection there for my family and for me\nAnd that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun that you want to to get a license foreign you've gone through the classes for a ... there's no protection\nWhatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado that guy quite literally avoided six southern theaters in the area because they all allowed people to carry guns\nWho wants to be interviewed tack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their twelve people died\nSo we are I think that you have to work in conjunction with the synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and I don't know if they do or don't I'm guessing they don't or they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance an exit\nThis way anybody getting an are getting out\nOr anybody get a good mood can be an emergency exit on the other side to get out but anybody getting into that facility and and they want to cause harm you're gonna you're gonna identify them before they can pull the trigger one time\nSure I mean I guess they can do it at the land they can certainly do it at a church [laughter]\nWell they all they do it in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House so so but people that we pay to be our legislators are representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House\nYou can't get anywhere near the place until you have a full body scan so why do they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah and I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play in like obviously that economic a\nFull body scan for example or even a metal detector and you know the other ... an item that it's not just a that have an accent the people around that and then in a church probably qualified people that are\nGoing to be there any way to get out that kind of thing but then there's training and call and right now I just feel like it\nLike I said as much as I don't agree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost ... market think that it's not a realistic I yeah\nI I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if you allow concealed carry by guys like you and me\nCongregation members that people know and that we know have have gone through the steps to get the license to be able to carry like but also you you just have a bus system where you have to be opposed to the to be let it I've been ... ended up itself could save some lives without a doubt it's a one eight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty

I. max the H. G. three mobile\n[noise]\nGet this book is called the blue collar president it's Anthony Scaramucci I'm a former communications director for the White House right\nWell yeah what was there for ... days it was a\n... days come on\nLet's appreciate I had a great time you know unfortunately I made a mistake and got blown out of my seat could uh you know there were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book with a you know what I was there to help the president they're loyal to the president you know I did some a media this morning I was on CNN\nAnd try to stand what I said that I call the president a liar it's not what I said the president is telling the ads like that and he's covering the truth is doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger in your eyeball 'cause he knows it's going to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all rocker\nAnd it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you're walking into stores and look I've been working CNN headline news on fifty over there I mean I did that when you walk in it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize\nThat there is a definitive spin when you walk into that ... did you know you were to get you know some some left hook from them and it's hard to get you to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting these horror this morning and I'm trying to sell a book they figure that could kill me with the base but that's fine people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president to say listen I get fired Fifteen months ago I wasn't loyal to the president's Joe you would have figured it out by now uh I wrote a very colorful very funny book [noise]\nAbout my relationship with him do what do you like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father when they were a lot younger you know his father's deceased but I'm going to get back into the seventies\nWhen his dad was working with him and mentoring in what they were like so this was a real fun book to write a book called me yesterday uh she said that she she went through the Bush and read it a hundred percent but Bush said it was great each couldn't wait to show it to her father encouraged\nOr one of his best friend said the same thing you know 'cause I listen I I I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing last too bad I'm a New Yorker I have to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... of course short for Pagliaro\nSewing and we we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like Anthony I got to tell you my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president of these people are fighters who come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of America and certainly not the elite media in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they get sent it there's micro aggressions Reagan president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotion feeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you\nAre and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they are offended by right\nThere was a tiny bit of a micro aggression they started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a Stradivarius that he does a ... and that's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm just asked my personality\nI agree it's embodied Sarah moved to the blue collar President Bill blue collar president is out now going up his great book\nLet's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he says he's running for president were you surprised I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually not surprised that they turned on him when he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty ... were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office\nAnd he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there was a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies and you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely like looks for a cost an out and tries to tell me your fake news oh I don't understand it and then he turned ... cost to eats it up he does it every time\nYou make a fool of themselves when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but uh but again if I thought it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened but um when you were in the job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House run the price of\nA I thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought there would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what\nAdam ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe you announced era as the press secretary I did the first press conference and I told her that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team\nAnd also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the ... plan\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets the context or\nHe was being very of secrets and flattering to me\nAny begging me effectively to do a profile story with him yeah trail me around and I'm like well I'm not Steve Bannon and I'm not their self promoting myself REM I use of expletives which I obviously regret she loved that guy changed ran over to CNN with it right he\nWaited he wrote this ridiculously ... you know exaggerated article and then you really should take you know four or five days later people and I'm like jeeze the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we want to they ambushed them to see if we can get him out of the White House or a you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping the president so what's\nThe other parts of it will give you went back to the right but\nIf you went and checked up a pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't ... who's going to be very direct you to be very strict with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with the ministry Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that\nYou got suckered into a little bit and it doesn't feel good I've had that happened to me but you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that guys like do anything you want to do we want to trust people\nHe ate Joe I made a mistake it's a vicious by first place down there I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street present Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you something the worst person on Wall street is literally the best person down there so while\nI I Know how bad it is down there and it is what it is and so for me uh a lot of my book is also about that well that you know where I got up\nDusted by selling off I was sort of like mayhem and they all say commercial coming through the car crash right and I told my kids watch what I Do with this thing now because you never want to do is be on your back for too long to you don't want the left wing media to build a shame box for you to stand inside of\nYou want to be you and so I'm I'm fully expressing myself a lot of fun writing this book I Hope that people who go out and buy the book at ten percent as much fun reading it as a kid writing it because it was really an enjoyable thing for me to do a lot of research that\nIt's a Anthony Scaramucci the new book is the blue collar prison and I urge you to go get to go get five copies give it to your friends and family it's the blue collar president a last question and I think people are dying to know descent but what's the relationship now with the president\n[noise] you know I Would say is good I mean we we we don't talk or a super ... is the part of the United states I don't feel the need to bother him yeah\nI had a very good conversation with him last July recording trade I put in an op ed in the ... we had a rigorous intellectual discussion about that um and I get along I mean we I think we see the world\nAre pretty similarly I'm and I'm not sword him I Hope he's not sort of me for what happened\nHe seems to be a that kind of guy I right at the end of the guys like ... I see myself a day wasn't fired because he was fired I was fired I call this S P L were fired but loyal [laughter] so you know I I feel very good about the president\nIs that the one of the toughest jobs in the world you I certainly didn't want to make it harder for him I was there to try and make it easier and by the way I'm here to help do I do a lot of media surrogacy for the campaign a and I'm writing a lot of a bench warmer state by state\nEverybody going to get this book the blue collar president it's Anthony Scaramucci you know some of that you said earlier in the interview really stuck out and it's a you know here it is Fifteen months later and you're still world for the president or a summer ocean was out for Fifteen seconds and had a new book\nSo uh I really think that that you showed your loyalty and the fact that the fact that you can look at me look at my listeners in and look at look at my viewers and say I made a mistake I should have thought the ... better and I really think I could have been an effective guy I agree with everything but you just said I think that's also\nGot on the mistakes you make in life you're going to tell my kids that be accountable I'm not blaming anybody I'm not playing the victim and one last thing which I think you would appreciate growing up the way you did and I hope you're listening\nComfort systems and they helped me pick the one that best ... mind needs and my home budget from carriers value priced ... part series to their top performing infinity system\nTerrier banks all their products with strong warranties and a commitment to provide innovation and quality a commitment that's made carrier the industry leader since Nineteen oh two carrier they make the best more affordable than ever turn to your local carrier expert\nHeads heating and air conditioning they've helped me with emergency in the past and with a brand new system that I still love call heads to the top one six five three seven eight seven three that's to buy one six five three seven eight seven three\nHeating and air conditioning branch of better [noise]\nFor more information about contests on this station go to news radio seven ten dot com slash rules\nAnd [noise] now WINZ em Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen they're happy Saturday I'm Jake done from NBC Fifteen call again tonight\nBut then warmer weather returns to the Gulf Coast fifty four on your Sunday Morning a lot of sunshine throughout the day in a high an eighty two sixty one on Sunday night and in low eighties on Monday a sneak peek at Halloween partly cloudy and eighty four I'm Jake done from this I heart radio station\nWe're watching out for your hand now we are indeed be Fifteen in\nFrom the honestly or plumbing and drained studios clearly Joyce this is news radio seven ten W.

things are important number one when you called your radio show\n'em you can't both be heard at the same time so do you make an allegation that I Want to comment on it you got to stop for a second and then I'll let you continue but the fact that she wouldn't have stopped talking she thought that she would whether she kept talking unfortunately for you I have the microphone and I have control of of what's being heard at any given time I now have a decision to make\nEither both of us speaking the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to hear either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking\nUm it's not going to be both ways now I Am a fair guy that I'll stop and let you continue but if we're gonna make allegation after about an allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work when it comes to\n... because there are there are a few big lives out there about Donald Trump\nHe was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true in fact the Muslim ban or the the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... and his Lama focus just not true of the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people\nAre very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very loud debate debate an emotional debate there are very uh there are bad people on both sides\nThere are very fine people on both sides\nThat if they were talking about isn't whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues to Confederate a war heroes or soldiers\nOr leaders that's what it was about cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments because they feel like they can and they really can't it's against the law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yep\nOr they're good people on the side of terror tear it down sure or they're bad people inside absolutely so he's ... he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and and the other left wing media outlets saying it over and over and drawing on and on and on and you actually believe\nThat he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not\nHe's never said anything that would that would suggest that he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disabled a reporter is also ally\nYes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms were I guess he I don't know what to do with the ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this\nAnd when he talks as have stay like that they it he doesn't have the full mobility of his hands that his in his forums as as most people do\nAnd the president when I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said do look at me any sort of did his hands at a similar fashion and made you know spoke at a at a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't ... mimicking them that way\nAnd be very good just go to you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are an exit several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even considering running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was depression was the ... was the making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when a reporter didn't do the reporting till two veteran sixteen\nOr maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not sometimes he acts like a dark that way the president and he does is he is that way and he speaks that way do look at me and Donald Trump um stupid ... you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're going to do your own research and independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant wouldn't hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and one not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker with the fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong and don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV Guide know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you\nYou may in fact at the end of the day no more than I Do but you failed in any debate when you walk into thinking you're superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level of anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in his business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces\nI gave you straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what by politics were so bring it next time beginning as well but you better bring it better than that All right let me get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the uh the the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate jour you\n\nOn this great when you\nHave really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind just got my attention it appears to be a plane of some sort and some beautiful flags
