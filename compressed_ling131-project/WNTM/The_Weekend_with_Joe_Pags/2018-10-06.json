away and then and then left she says the guy to be more judge was in the room was playing the music loudly and running interference for Kavanaugh mark judge says wasn't there no idea what she's talking about\nHer her very good friend late and somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else did she said was at that party has refuted the claim\nWell Christine Blasey Ford testify in front of his panel the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd leaving their left and right middle everybody sergeant credible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party and she's actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nRed cabin on the other hand\nHas everybody corroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\n\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets the help she needs some help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that to a point of delineation that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and didn't report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez\nWho says that at a party\nThey were playing some game\nThat I don't know you do to spin the bottle or it was ... quarter as they were playing something to where if you lost you had a drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk she's going to remember anything and then she's told\nBrett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out and put it in near her face\nNow she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrat senators that are on that panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed\nSomething happened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it so which Kavanaugh said no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an Audi this Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys part taking in gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said would spike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happen between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party she wants ten of them in Nineteen eighty two she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued going to the parties for another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once\nNBC News instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable they ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times that her history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lay he that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons they didn't didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\n\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because\nThe calls all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he grow up to a girl he he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent\nNothing any of these women has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resists lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely\nRob read it in fact refuted by people\nJulie sweat Nick just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's giving\nAnd of course the Ford\nOnly ... say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days six days interviewing many more people in ... didn't come to the bushes offer evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today going Twitter\nRead your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up at the Senate halls there ... people which means are putting out their information their their phone numbers their addresses it say a violent crew of idiots\nBetter still just completely disconnected from the rest of us would listen to the lotto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh\nThey're

that she had this letter\nEven when she was talking to Brett Kavanaugh privately in her office didn't say a word had a letter when she was questioning Brett Kavanaugh\nI'm In the open to hearing didn't say a word when it looked as though Brett Kavanaugh was going to be fast track because he's easily qualified for this job then suddenly somebody in her office or some lawyers somebody leaked to the fact that there was a letter and with the woman's name was\nFor the matter what you think of Christie loves before she was a victim your two of the left politics\nEight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty when we go to the phone lines to see where you are on this coast were either a country divided on world country galvanized I think this was just\nAn ...\nSalute practice\nIn futility for the left and I think that it probably served to motivate those on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans now\nGo to and even centuries that lean right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have said set at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats in the Senate and we'll keep control of that body it's still going to be very close in the house but we have a better chance now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation\nBy the left in this country the political left let me go on the phone lines and

representative and not\nGetting this crap and and get very disappointed in the whole process than that we have and the needs to be elected in ... the green card Jeff\nWell Roger I think it's a very good point the Republicans were very weak in the beginning venture for the call by the way I'm very weak in the beginning they just they wanted to keep the Koran they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but when the hearings started let's go back to that a month ago\nAs soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely you all this fake outrage about how cabinet interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family\nKamala Harris purposely interrupted him yeah Cory Booker purposely interrupted him\nI think over started\nThey were ... ... it was it was set up then you had protesters that there are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the chamber of protest so all this fake outrage about Brett Kavanaugh on it and his ... and his temperament is it's all BS\nBut I agree with you the Republicans and grassy I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of this can be I Will clear there's room if you're given interrupting than it would ... would proper protocol is where they were breaking it on purpose\nBecause they really thought they're putting on a show which somehow waiting for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it

how anybody could think that Corning crying or at a man makes him guilty\nAnd you got to listen to both sides if that's true but that's why the court case and I just I get off or what they're trying

it very very hypocritical they were interviewing the man to be a um fair and fair and honest person who decides to pray and court cases where we find it very strange when he gets extremely angry when he's accused in the face with crime\nI'm both a a survivor I Will never said victim survivor of a sexual assault more than one [noise]\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we let\nOff celebrations like the um Dr Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing to do that with cabinet right if we let women like to come forward and do this kind of damage to announce reputation it's actually going to set back women testifying by decade\n[noise] um I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked\nAnd it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBecause women have notoriously done at when they've been scorned or that or or many other things and the fact that we would want to do that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh\nWho surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now it it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they are becoming more socialist\nI have a friend that that would actually grew up in Argentina and came home became a citizen and she is\nA hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what it's truly like to live in a socialist country\nWe don't want to go that way but I just find it so hypocritical that here we're examining the person for a job in a court where he's supposed to be fair right we get that when he showed his emotions when he's being attacked unjustly\n... you couldn't be more correct I mean he's used facing something one of the most unfair things I've ever seen and then be chargers no go and be fair and and liberal hinted about this I'm Sorry I'm Sorry that happened to you and I'm Glad that you're a survivor and you're not looking at yourself as a victim no I I I Wonder\nDo you remember the details of what happened to you because this was love you for doesn't remember anything does that mean you just all the victims the survivors that I've ever spoken with have remembered every book\nWhere she lived to me one of my I had a a less traumatic incident when I was fourteen and where she completely lost me agreement single parent household with that there were six cats when\nI was fourteen I had something like that happened to me I didn't tell my mom right away but I wouldn't leave her side for men right that when she first started to lose me was when she said that they went to the grocery store and she wanted to go on a separate entrance just weeks later when\nAfter she almost died than the fact that she had the physical composure to say Hi to someone that was in that room when I saw my attacker when I was Eighteen and was it was a home invasion I was raped and my home again\nI found him in court I didn't ... L I couldn't look in the eye and tell us and I kinda find him but I became ill and I had a horrible memory my family laugh about it all the time they'll say to me mom don't you remember not pay that was your first day\nBut I Can't remember what I was wearing every single detail and oh time every single detail there's nothing good isn't completely clear and men in my memory\nI guess I found her not credible with regard to cabinet and honestly I hate data but mine are not credible I'm trying to be as open minded and I know because I was in law enforcement and I know what ... ... oh my God on her now she's\n... and I'm ... I'm with you but but you you and I both know that the the left said well here's what we're going to do with was before no matter what she says\nThe word we are going to use as credible to everybody that we talk to and we're going to force them to repeat credible\nBecause then the the watching and listening public will will agree\nBut she was credible but around with you and I and I said there's really on me I Believe that maybe she was a victim of something or survivor or something I don't think anything she said about Brett Kavanaugh was in fact credible in fact that was the wrong usage about words and that's where I was I mean\nAnd I was attacked because I said that but so what I mean I saw when I saw heard what I heard an even her best friend doesn't corroborate that tells me something\nWell and and I I what what meal in a way it's how much I have personally been attacked\nBy either survivors chronic back then because they allowed it to the point that like me away as I had a guy friends that I grew up with that I Can't\nBelieve with your history that fully her I Would be doing a complete the fair to say if I get\nI I agree we we have to run great phone call I appreciate you taking the time\nWe bet somebody who really gets it\nWe come back we'll be Donald Trump junior here on the weekends bigger [noise]\n\nMessaging ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech\nCompanies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's O.

Donald Trump junior really glad to have the time when he suggested to you and your and your siblings I'm probably going to really do this you're initial reaction was well of course you should do it or no way did\nListen I I wanted them to do it I you know he had been so Bogle he'd been so tough on it and and it was time you know you you see the nonsense that's going on you say that the the reality is that there's no one that could have accomplished what he's been able to do that no one that you know so few that ever signed the front of a paycheck so few that I'd ever you know in our whole political system that had ever had\nIt there someone family some of the livelihood their safety and wellbeing of their kids and grandkids dependent on their success he'd actually done it I mean that was the big laugh I had last week when you know Obama's running around claiming ... you know\nI remember when Obama say hey you didn't build that it's like\nNow now now he owns it right because his policies of oppressive taxation insane regulation they enroll hatred towards business we went oh you didn't do that I mean Obama himself when my father I don't know why we couldn't have three three and a half four percent even even better right GDP Growth Obama goes and I go out there is no magic wand for that\nRight we have to New York times back him up no no no because you know of course he can do no wrong there this is the new normal well Africa Deborah yeah of course we expect Obama to be able to fix anything you've never done anything\nIt turns out you know far scissors or\nDone anything you'd never had any experience there was no way and we should expect him to be able to fix anything economically guess what my father has done that\nHe has built a business it he didn't build that and so it shouldn't be a shock to people that were able to turn that around and now the Democrats won a reversal of that they want to take everything into one eighty why because we have an all time historic lows for blacks and unemployment\nFor Hispanics for women you you want to reverse all that I mean if the Democrats the ... sorry Donald Trump came out today in favor of\nOxygen Democrats would be against it I mean that's their policy it's just hate\nBut we have to show up we have to stay on the fight because people's\nThey've done I Love your dad doing it's so great it's amazing it's you know but I say well how are you voting for who your congressman they are voting for November what do you mean it was November\nRight they're not able to where they want to vote and twenty twenty but they don't realize that it can all go away in twenty Eighteen they don't realize that Donald Trump is on the ticket in twenty Eighteen Donald Trump is on the ticket in six weeks\nSo we got to get out we got to mobilize if you like what's going on to\nMake sure the fight for it because the other side I don't know what they're motivated by I don't even know what their platform there's other than you know hate and outrage I mean you know what their outrage or they should be outraged about their platform and their failures over the last few decades but there are outraged about something else but they are turning up\nWe got to turn up I see it all the time they're like no no no the same fake news media that said Donald Trump can't win is saying that he's going to lose now\nBelieve it I see the numbers you got to get out you got to stay in we can't just be fat happy and lazy and expect that stuff to continue he needs he needs guys like Ted Cruz got any guys like ... to all of the congressional people in Texas that are up he need those guys helping him he can't do it by himself and I didn't giving the house Nancy Pelosi\nBigger series like serious question about it I mean that would be a disaster for this country but then we got to turn around and we got to bring our friend\nIt's trending on drudge today to ... you blows to use their young I'm going to be the speaker again it's Donald Trump junior and do we we always appreciate the time a couple of things they didn't realize that your dad had the magic wand the whole time we didn't want\nIt was common sense and experience right you know it is it or not magic wand it's just you know you can't expect a community organizer to ... understand let alone actually affects the way real change when it comes to economic fiscal policy on fiscal well I think about it we we've discussed the economy I Know him what about foreign policy\nI look at the end they'll look at the Israeli embassy\nYou look at what's going on in North Korea that took guts fine you know we don't just draw red line in Syria like Obama did when they crossed that they slap you in the face where they they tried doing that at least fifty seven Tomahawk missiles in there and guess what the rest of the world was watching\nOkay we were not going to let people take advantage of something whether it's trade deals get NAFTA it can't be renegotiated can be done\nAnd congratulations Mexico and Canada now on board done like ... when when when you have a real leader\nI Wish that we had somebody in journalism in journalism was dead known him and he says is all the time too but it didn't go on one person steps up and says\nFormer President Obama just told me one thing you did that caused this to happen because how you take credit for it if you look your dad when one eighty on everything Obama dude and fixed everything how can Obama even for a second even think to himself yeah I did that because we're not\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and that's why we all have to get out because we're fighting with one arm to arms to arms and a leg it feels like at times because the media will yeah like I said oh no this is the new normal one point ... percent what doesn't that doesn't have to be why why would the New York times back him up on that front because they needed to make him a success because they all believe in the asinine policies you see that\nI mean look at what's going on in fact that in bed or August putting up a challenge I mean Beto O'Rourke and run for mayor of New York city and be on the left side of a ticket\nI mean and that's the only way\nYou know his his money is coming from all places other than Texas because you know those are in Texas the values that he espoused or you know the attacks on law enforcement want to eliminate ice in the ... I mean I only saved nine hundred kitten last year from you know a sex trafficking but they're terrible we should get rid of them I mean these people are insane\nAnd so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends and you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your business is look at what's going on your place of work what can your paycheck I mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America's getting respect again\nBecause we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around\nYou know I may have changed and\nWe have to remember that because they can all go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the access let's talk about Texas I as you don't based in San Antonio Fifteen stations in Texas we've got a hundred and twelve around the country but we focus now in Texas because there's been a real challenge Robert Francis awoke is what I call in these somehow cold really appropriating but he's Hispanic and he's\nNot he's not at all and spending on he'll pretend he is for the road but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic swimming but if it's something like that they would destroy absolutely\nYou you you were going to get out of every day\nFor it or it's not a problem when he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem\nThat only one day story of Ted Cruz did that it it wouldn't be you know he should be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ...\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing has been great for taxes he's done he's fought for those values I look at the ... platform and like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate running for senator in Texas\nWell he's getting big support for Mellon so you know that's good\nNews is Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who I've known\nFor ... wait longer than he's been a senator and he's always made promises that he's always done exactly what he said he would do was the first thing is you're dead and then went out in the primaries but they're very very similar politically in that they're not doing your politically they say I'm going to do this this this this and this and you're dead and had\nActually believe I should do those things I promise bigger I was just given those you know a rainbows and puppy dogs it's weird well of\nCourse I listen I I really respect at him and it looks like it was a brutal primary and a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly but ... you know a couple of weeks after that and it was brutal primary there was a big a a dinner in DC you know the usual you know this stuff [laughter]\nI I I went and all my friends are from tax on there all the time hunting fishing or a lot of money during the campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and avid it a couple of friends ... at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation\nAt the end of the dinner we say hey you know we're going back to the Trump Hotel\nRight in the middle of the sea on Pennsylvania Avenue a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along\nIt came with us and that and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours nice that's got yeah but you know and it showed me\nBeyond the guts if he understood down from going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good protects and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituencies and that was impressive to me that was a great\nA testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told that story before but I think it's actually relevant or because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean again look at where\nBagel rocks money is probably coming from writing that probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that probably represents the average guy in a Hollywood studios so you know that's the difference and I don't want Texas to become California\nAt Texas a I mean just look at the economic success if it had to look at all the stats but you want to become California give me a break\nAnd and the people from California bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior up you have an opinion as to why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut ...\nI'm going to lower your paycheck we're going to open the border we're going to get rid of our butts in forcing the border in every single week they're either catch agreements Thirteen or stopping sex trafficking\nWhy would anybody want new you blows you to be in charge of getting things are going so great right now why you have no idea but like I said\nWe're we're not in a fair fight you know the media will show this is the right thing to do it but I'm all for taking care of other people once we take care of our own problems but we've got plenty of friends who are going to disastrous education system where what twenty eight in the world after\nA long list of third world countries to the gym and half of you know to spend and I have spent the a small fraction of what we spend per capita right I mean we had we had that problem that we're working on fixing and they're making great progress with all of those things but like we need to keep going\nAnd you're going to have people in there that basically the next two years until twenty twenty you will be a total stalemate nothing will get done it'll be a total disaster\nI Want to keep this winning going for another six years so we need people in the house my father can't do it by himself\nWhat I heard about Fox News this morning\nI'll

I heart radio station\nFrom the mail into an ideology and hearing that are mobiles studios bell tone making the world here better news radio seven ten W when GM\nLoses a Fox News or learn to do to your President Trump is speaking at a rally in Topeka, Kansas where he's talking about the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court after arriving in Topeka he committed to reporters\nBeautiful thing is he is now when\nHe's going to be there for a long time and he's just an outstanding\nOutstanding scholar\nLawyer bringing that everything is ever done\nSo we're very happy and the vote was a\nIt was a great voted very historic vote that\nVote was fifty to forty eight the confirmation has been met by protests in Washington near the capital and the Supreme Court here chanting November is coming [noise]\nSome arrests were made earlier about the courage cabinet has been sworn in a ceremony is set for next week\nThis was a Fox News or [noise]\nThe news you want to know ... and all of the age of fifty one the nose forty nine motions\nYour seatbelt said in the no news radio seven\nTen un GM\n[noise] all these\nAmazing radio stations Joe ... dot com all the social media there the live video feed as well [noise] the blaze radio network it used\nThe weekend with Joe ... along for the ride thanks a lot of her stopping by had an opportunity to to um\nCatch up with Kellyanne Conway earlier this week\nAnd she of course is the counsel to president ... the one with the president you know gives a ton of credit\nFor his win in ah in twenty six team and we just got to talk about cabin on the list of what was going on the economy as well the midterms coming up uh to me it was an appropriate time at any time Kelly and wants to go on to be honest with you know we actually when I used to build for going on a\nOn television and radio in the day uh met Kellyanne Conway probably\nEleven or twelve years ago she was on TV show 'em back then so we've been friends for a long time about ... appreciate Joe are you I'm wonderful how are you today I'm doing great\nYou you know I started out when I answered the phone I used to manage bizarro world and you actually very positively said you know really glass half full right it's\nA funny way as that Kavanaugh had last week tonight I wake up on the counter I had in the mountain right\nI'm sure that great time to be alive and pregnant entering a fantastic job and keeping us peaceful and prosperous sounding you can you can't argue with the jobs numbers which I think it's by the mainstream media where he used to cover it and they've never seen a positive data point that they had ignored enough and I guess that that's that down ever\nCovering this economy jealous God Forbid it ever starts to go down but even on the numbers you already know the low unemployment numbers among\nAfrican American Asian Americans in Hispanic Americans in winning they're teenagers and veterans and and the growth rate at that but even today I was very little coverage anywhere but it was an accident and one hundred and eighty five thousand new products actually got traded for the last month and two hundred and thirty thousand\nSo the wages are up the job availability is up people feel mobile they can move around and find a better job closer to home maybe with better health care and retirement benefits and that's what freedom looks like the deregulation agenda that the twenty eight or so judges on the United states circuit court of course justice Gorsuch in\nAnd perhaps soon followed by justice capital\nIt's Kellyanne Conway a counter to the president I got to tell you ... you know and by the way she was also the woman that the president says really the reason why you want to win the election and I agree with that when we talk about cabinet they couldn't make anything ... to be brought him early on as you said\nThey couldn't get him on the merits Mel let's go back and find out who he you know it might have dubbed the auto was back when he was fourteen now the guys who abuse device allegedly somebody at a bar after you be forty soldier because ... will be really have nothing against the guy we have no way to stop the guy so we'll just below sitting behind him and you've got\nA far left wing resist lawyer that's that's helping out\nYou know some of these witnesses I mean when you step back just for a second and take a look at it\nThey weren't going to be okay with anybody were there\nAnd they're not they're also not going to those who have said that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominate joy Supreme Court are certainly not going to find their way to supporting judge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen\nAnd so they should just be honest about what this is this is about destroyed destroying a man's life\nBecause he's he was nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping the seat open pass in terms of not three twenty twenty and Americans had it Americans are smart and they're watching this process people are disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford\nHas Dianne Feinstein a Democrat is due to blame that she is now a household name a recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it and after the twelfth our had told and\nBut for the Republicans bloody Ford may not have ever had a forum to testify under oath it's the Senate Judiciary committee and the majority of the other Republicans they gave her that um but you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of\nFolks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed this last July which is on the desk of every senator\nSo we'll see what happens but if you're if you're a few of those red state Democrats Joe pads you're really nervous today because you're caught between a on one hand your Democratic Party drifting so far to the left towards socialism and toward destruction and resistance an obstruction and delay and and and stop\nSign as a symbol of your party and you're stuck between that and the will of your own people right\nBecause West Virginians and and ... and who is in Indiana and certainly people in North Dakota announced read they want judge Kavanaugh confirmed and they want their senators to do their jobs advising contending and voting for him\nIs er tells the president Kellyanne Conway till you do you think that there should be an ethics committee investigation into Feinstein or whoever on her stuff leak that out to settle this for two months she could have talked to terminal directly when they met privately if you could have brought it to the president should as you got the letter\nYour rights you settlement because you hope that they would be them down on the merits they couldn't the guy is supremely qualified to be in this job news are going to be an investigation should there be\nWell I saw some members say that they were going to investigate it I saw Senator Tom cotton last week and say that very thing that they should investigate the leak of the of the letter and or the other thing that's happening as Senator Hatch made reference I Believe it was yesterday Joe to the to the\nOdd consequences that could follow to Ford's lawyers who either\nNeglected to mention to her which was their their duty they mentioned it to Ford that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California but\nI'm having a come to Washington either foreign lied under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and then fill it fair to tell us you know there are no cameras and cleaned lights\nBecause parents want what's best for their kids\nBecause most has over seven zillion auction and not one involves a freezer am I going to come into most southwest real today to get

Murkowski is not really a Republican she's more of a moderate even leaning lefty she somebody easily controlled by Dianne Feinstein and she made a big mistake you're I think that she's going to be done in twenty twenty two\nI'm ...
