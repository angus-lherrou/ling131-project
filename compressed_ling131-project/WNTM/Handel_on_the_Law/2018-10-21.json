{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "A couple of years after the say on he was in a really bad car accident he was with his pitch dark ... eyes\nA car accident and his healing processes aided by pain killers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems\nAnd I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic and much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry I don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile\nSaid on 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my old James Pike up yes he was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian and so there's another Canadian connection yes\nYeah and I think it and I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven for how a say on for pike now pike son had tragically committed suicide\nThe year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on with the tip of the secret do their own that\nYou're kind of breaking up a ... a a I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak maybe okay that\nArea it's actually a voiceover IT line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay\nI'm James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little up front research\nBrings it into the sand and says if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for this they out and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case as fun as it is and is exciting it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sands in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has\nA perhaps that had damaged his a medium abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYeah yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my account but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place\nAnd so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA I'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's defect on the Doppler will be higher closer to God and the spirits anyway\nI think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so he's pretty much guaranteed they're going to fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kind of make it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine affirming that she had been contacted through\nA Arthur Ford has been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm now someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you and if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being the spirit guide and for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nSure um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nDo a whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand time and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere and trying to this proves the survival of consciousness and I resorted to trick to prove my point\nFor the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible\nI Am now and here in my desire to undo this mistake how all the last debate because of my mistake to lay a whole again of hope and to live with the knowledge that life is continue with\nThat is my message to the world through my wife and through this psychic media those are the were\nFantastic Thomas how do people get a hold of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAmazon dot

I was made it into the hospital over the course for the next six days I'd had a CAT scan rearm ... MRIs and a spinal tap\nAt the six day those doctors cannot determine what was wrong throughout those six days or can can you were\nBasically paralyzed on the right side of my body after six days they just charged me not knowing what was going literary saying take two Advil calm airport is\nSo we went to get a second opinion the second doctor said he didn't see the ... from the first doctor was also on earth mirror surgeon by the way so we went to go get those are more hours but I I felt like I was having a stroke my right side\nMore touring er my voice was armed my right side of a base or ... I went to a different hospital [noise]\nWithin two hours they were able to tell me that did not have a stroke that I had to bring a cancerous brain tumor\nImmediately started during work I had a biopsy they told me I was diagnosed with the question is if I could have gotten earlier that tumor or not to put pressure on my brain I Would not have been a Sable\nI'm OK Now okay I got it uh so let me throw some questions that you\nUh during the course of those six days had the doctors are discovered a that you had this brain tumor\nOh I'm Sorry\nI yeah I Know the doctors and not discover it but they're so over six days to the brain tumor grow and cause pressure\nYes sir over six days the tumors grew Yes sir and how do you know\nBecause I ... I was able to walk into the hospital so I my main walk normally ... layer that was put in such pressure on my brain dark and there was on my bring them mhm that I could not walk I could\nNot pay and I was in ... I'm assuming well uh my guess is ah you left your ah neurosurgery surgery residency a little bit earlier so you weren't you didn't get board\nCertified um do you have a doctor that will say two things number one I had they taken out the tumor six days before I you would never have had these problems\nAnd you would be fine you wouldn't had slurring you wouldn't matter problem there wouldn't be pressure\nI don't know why I'm calling you may not talk to my\nCat ... won't be in in colleges it'll be a it'll be a neurosurgeon who's ... going to make that call and you're gonna have to have that doctors say that and willing to testify to that so that's one issue how about let's start with the second issue I any permanent brain damage any permanent injury neurological injury\n[noise] not that I Know it's\nOkay so what you have is you hear your damages six days of slurring and six days of ... walking around or not walking around thinking you had a stroke okay what what does that work six days of that when he\nWas not able to work\nI mean you must do you miss six days work I understand there's some damage as they are not arguing that aren't damages I'm what I'm saying is what do you think that's worth\nI honestly I'm no\nI yeah I don't either so I I think even though there could very well have been malpractice I eat then there may be an argument that there wasn't we looked and or a doctor could have easily miss that I that's the other defense that uh the first group of doctors said but you're making a lot of medical exemptions here\nThat ah you I don't have the legal right to make that you're going to need some very heavy duty second opinions\nAnd it's going to get very wonky and very technical and you can bet the insurance company is going to defend this thing like crazy and you're going to need a top notch medical malpractice surgeon\nWho's payoff will be six days\nOf you walking around like you were slurring and losing six days of work do you see the problem\nRight but that's continued to this day\nThat's what I asked is do you have any long term problem as as a result of what happens and having missed the tumor for six days is that what's cause the long term problems\nYeah okay and you know that for a fact as doctors have told you that\nYes I mean I'm Still going through chemotherapy\nI'm not arguing that you would have gone through chemotherapy anyway correct All right so\nSix days is all the difference in the world you'd be jumping you'd be doing a judge jumping jacks you'd be flying around and you'd be fine if they had discovered the tumor six days before\nYeah okay I Believe I'm well doctor and\nA ... where where was your residency in neurosurgery let's go through that because we have to put you on the stand and uh we have to uh absolutely

hello Laura Hi yeah\nThen I was employed two and a half year than I had exceptional work ethic and performing and my boss discriminated against me and my religion and political affiliation\nOr how well first of all are your what is your religion\n[laughter] okay and I'm assuming you're not a wild ... liberal is that fair to say oh got it and you're not [laughter] yeah but I kept to myself okay fanatic alright so uh the discrimination is ah how ah was it shown to you\n[noise] um she made a comment in front of a couple of other she hates Christian\nOkay now ... that's all she did she say she hey Christian were you fired where you've demoted or were you held back for promotion or is it just she hates Christian\nLuck man so I kind of transfer out I've heard of it and then a lemonade that my position [noise]\nWow okay protected by her by her good friend\nAh who is no doubt a VP at a Muslim or a Jew or or [laughter] or somewhat of ... ah yeah here's here's the problem you have\nIs uh that I mean I'm ... on his face it looks like it is straight out discrimination show there doesn't seem to be a\nA lot of a lot of doubt there but let me tell you which way the law goes on this even if you can prove discrimination and your boss can prove there was any other reason uh in addition to that ... that firing flies also eliminating the position completely gives them a lot\nOf a just a tremendous amount of power for example I Know the company\nThat had a and it's a company that is in it's in the spotlight I mean it's that people know about discovery and there was an issue a day and African American who was working there and I was and it was very obvious that this was the one African American that was their out of two or three people\nWhat they did is they just shut down the entire division and that I literally and said everybody everybody in the division is a shutdown we decided to shut down the division and boom where are you going to go with that or you shut down the division because you are a bunch of racist or not we\nShut down the division as a as a business decision [noise] see that's the problem that uh you're up against\nMy performance for better than the three repaired but together but that's what you say and that they have proof that\nBut he but even so as I say I division part is going to be a horrible also because your performance used to be wonderful doesn't mean that she's going to say that you are in subordinate\nAh right she doesn't judge\nSaid that it has changed I mean those are very very hard cases uh Laura how how's your Hebrew [laughter]\nHorrible I see I work on that a lot truly [laughter] All right Laura\nThat yeah I mean it it it used to be where discrimination was\nIt was it was a good bang when or if you could prove discrimination the court has actually gone the other way in California which was a shocker to me when I heard about the court and because I and also firing someone you can fire someone for any reason\nBut say you're employed and you're the best one in the division by far proof Syria is a you know what I learned when a fire you today I'm your boss or just don't like any more boom you're gone with no rights\nSo uh it gets to be a problem to say the least\nOr to get you out of it will be dismissed I mean there's no question you're you don't have liability here a base on what you said to because you didn't know oh you're innocent he just came out and do this you don't know what he paid for which credit card you have no idea now they got fraud and the company but it's a superior court action\nA ... at this point uh I Would contact a lawyer or that's representing the or the company that's suing and and just and send them a letter first of all say he was going on and just say hey I I had nothing to do with\nThis nothing and lay it out\nAnd just say I I really appreciate if you were dismissed this because I shouldn't be a defendant right\nIt's one of those where you will win but you have to go to court have been dismissed ... lawyer actually gives a damn interviews you as an instant is an innocent party here\nAnd you truly are then there should be a dismissal just because he's a decent\nGuy right sometimes not but that's worth a shot just a broader so I kinda feel there's\nNo there's nothing to counter to nothing to counter to on a because even if you are not liable I in the end there is not a frivolous lawsuit or he did work on your house the allegation if you were caught up in this is legit it's a legitimate allegation and may not be true\nBut it is\nAn allegation it's not as if he just grab your neighbor and started suing your neighbor and there's no connection so but you do not counters too but at first I just asked to get out of the damn thing and then and then you're probably gaps the lawyer especially if it's an enormous amount of money\nOkay well I wasn't then I brought in a ... the attorney but I also have to file every bond\nYes you do yes you do well thirty days you have to file a response and you need some help with that we're on an avid attorney I could just you know you can do that\nYourself you write well actually I go to a paralegal and because you want to put some of ... yeah you want to just there are some legal language that you have to know now you can go on the Internet and do your own research ah that talks about the fences and there are affirmative defense is but uh it's yeah you can do it yourself or with a little bit of research\nI absolutely Lorraine Lorraine welcome to handle on law I bail yes\nI kept my car or in the habit that this is a pattern noise in my car and ethics lawyer they fix my brakes worked for perfect when I took the car and driver Kay\nSure ah you have a chase him and then you have to pay for all right ah yeah\nFigure out first of all you want the money back for what you paid for and that's it that's all you're gonna get a fact that he didn't fix ah the noise ah you're still the same place with a noisy car and it could be the battering you're hearing aid is going south and you're hearing rattling noises and ah I have no idea how that works\nBrian Hi Brian welcome ...\nWanted to ask you a for years whenever I see my dentist he's trying to uh talked me into installing a bridge on a a I have an open more that I've been chewing on for ten years no no uh\nNo problem [laughter] and trying to talk me into installing a bridge on their thing and it was a big three and a half weeks ago I allowed him to do it three thirty five hundred dollars and part of that preparation for bridge is you're going down the to write\nTo teeth I'm Sorry yes I have one that I've\nBeen in a structure for three and a half we thought it was settled down it didn't [laughter]\nI've been on ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you know twenty four hours a day for almost a month now and sent me to an end though Don to yesterday and uh he says that I'm going to need to root canal grounded proved them too much for the hope is almost to the store\nThat's lovely okay so what's your question\nSo his response of uh my original Dennis responses is just one of those things that happen\nOut now does that first of all I don't even understand why a dentist would push for a bridge today when they're dental implant\nI mean all you have to do I have a bad do you put it in a dental implant so you don't have to do a bridge which I mean I have a bridge but it was put in the decades ago before implants where you've been around so I I have no choice or by I mean the guy is from what you said this is pure malpractice\nNow you need a you have to go to another Dennis it'll say yeah this is crazy and then as soon as that happens or you get to take 'em for malpractice problem is how much his dental malpractice worse\nUh but now you start going and doing all kinds of research first step get another Dennis get a second opinion to say this is crazy this is not just one of those things would happen this is malpractice on his face\nAnd then you go from there and then you start talking to\nMedical malpractice people are and there's plenty to specialize in dental malpractice\nAnd I'm not really interested in pursuing\nYour fingers right now than get it straightened out and send them a bill I mean you can assume anyway and if it's under ten thousand dollars a year go ahead and there was no problem and go to small claims court another problem is going to be you'd have to bring a dentist in there\nYou're gonna you're going to have to bring in a dentist a dental a dentist who's going to be a witness because he's going to say in my professional opinion this is one of those things that he just went south and he's within the uh that is you are within that tiny little percentage that no matter what job I Do it's going to go south okay\nAnd and I let her be be appropriate being done of it then\nYeah maybe or bring in lots of them are bringing in two or three and then see what the judge has to say OK okay alright try yeah tennis is he spent all these years talking unit doing something\nWent in in ... when you when you look at a dentist hockey when to anything you go to a dentist when you need a dentist\nKnow you've probably heard by now or the new hack\nOr Facebook actually Facebook\nHas had to ... within a couple of weeks of each other and it's kind of crazy how many tens of millions\nOf people have had their odd information exposed to these hackers so uh well that's a good reason why light flock is so important is certainly to me I've been protected by life lock
