everybody else sides\nThat's it yeah yeah it's a while now I'm Sorry it was supposed to be [laughter] and I understand\nBut I think they can charge anything above that now it could be that they only charge ten cents a and uh that's the way it goes I don't know what the law reads I mean you can look up the law that's easy or just look up the statute\nWhere they changed it and just read the damn thing you know just go on the Internet and go you know ten cents a bag law mandatory bag payment whenever a search\nWords you want but I based on if there isn't a law that says the stores can only charge ten cents and they must charge ten cents then all they can do is charged fans but my guess is that there is a ten cent charge in the stores can charge way beyond that\nWow yeah\nSo bring it can be the answer is you bring your own Dan bear hug you when you go to the story I don't know what I'm saying I always bring their own recycle bags [noise] right right right yeah okay there's your

lawyer charging I just had an issue with a a lawyer headed I needed some business documents a six and a quarter an hour\nSix hundred and twenty five dollars an hour and by the way that's not off base either for a good lawyers summers seven hundred appeals\nLawyers can be nine hundred thousand dollars an hour senior ... senior partners in a law firm you can run nine hundred thousand bucks an hour so when you have to pay for a lawyer and a good lawyer you have to look at whether you have a good case or not\nAnd that's why I Love law is the principal thing I Want to file a lawsuit okay go go for it you know you'll enjoy yourself and then the judge says you're absolutely right thank you the other side can't do it anymore and you're out Fifteen thousand dollars\nA Israel Israel I Am here Yes sir or we're going to do for you\nAll right I'll Patrick for ten years um you know and I was a pretty conservative denomination a long story short my wife had an affair or the nomination did not care whose fault it was if you're not able to lead the album and God or lead your own house\nCurrently the album God so I was removed from ministry wow kept my ordination\nUh for two years I was I'm working back and forth or email thought about getting in a ... as a pastor a finally here's later I was given my termination notice however they back they did it take a day before my ten year\nWhere I Would have been backed into my tension play a lot of my church lots I wipe it off like that in a way that they were my ... through\nAll right well first of all I Want the nomination is is a a Methodist\nI'm Sorry free method is yeah you know I deal with that is have you considered becoming would say a Muslim or a Jew\n[laughter] oh actually I met you ought to use I should just go that route\nAnd you know what I Love that because you know what the uh you know what people called messianic Jew so people that believe in Christ\nWhat that Christians not so we call them they're not messianic Jews just saying just throwing that out always had a pleasure talking about that a barrier where you can do ah I think you can go for your pension\nBecause uh that was knocking you off one day a is retaliatory and as predators or a predatory I mean that is I mean they're just a bunch of bastards they really are to do that well yeah they sure have that Christian outlook on life don't they\nAh and yeah absolutely\nAnd now the issue of uh their belief if you can't hold your own house in order you can't leave you certainly can't a lead a house in God or which is also a complete ... if your wife leaves you and a has an affair it's somehow it's your fault I Love that\nMan that's another reason why he signed up just switching ah religions Israel I mean this this is a tough way to

ensure a another church\nCan't funny you say that actually I was just approached by one of the new leaders that just stepped up and and one of the higher positions and they asked if I were still interested and uh I kinda wondered if if uh if I did do that if they would have to take off the fact that they terminated me and kind of kept me on fourteen years\nNow that's the other issue is as you talk to or the new folks that you are I'm considering going back to the church or at least having a a a a church ... what do they call\nThat ... percent of juice a congregation congregation and that's

attorney that would take my case on contingency basis um\nMy father died I got sixty three hundred my brother said should have been over a hundred thousand [noise]\nAnd they're telling me the only way [noise] um\nWhat is your only get sixty three hundred because she took the money I guess okay so you have to sue the she was a a trustee was at a trust her was in a wheel in the world that I have All right and uh she was a I guess the executor\nShe was not appointed she disappointed herself\nSo how did she get access to the money\nI guess he trusted her with the code or you're the alright well I I don't know\nI had to pass on Christie okay that's the problem is that she's going to argue that was my dad wanted me to have the money otherwise you wouldn't have put my name in their eye and when the will ... will specifically talking about the bank account\n[noise] yeah I'm On the line that I have to you know whatever's left in there was supposed to go to me\nAll right but that one has ever left there and they talk and it was specifically mentioning that bank account\n[noise]\nKnow what I Will talk with him again I I wasn't raised with them [noise] my brother's everything but my brother almost dies so he couldn't be in\nRegina I think you're going to have a hard time I mean you can easily go to the website handle on law dot com and we have trust in a state lawyers but it's a it's not going to be easy and how long ago did this happen Regina\nMy father down how long ago how many how many years ago did this happen to know\nHe just died okay so where the money how do you know the money has been taken\nBecause the bank told me that the accounting clothes she closed in February that when I got\nAnd how do you know over a hundred thousand dollars now to count\nMy brother shot before he almost died he was in a bus accident and so\nI thought well you it's going to be tough getting someone to do it on a contingency but ah you your brother said he saw it and how did he see it\nWith my father wanted him to be in charge he took him around the\nWheel with the wheel specifically says the money goes to you\nYeah All right well you tried ... I talked to an attorney or because there was an affair and now the trick is over a hundred thousand dollars you know taking a contingency that one is a problem because if the money's all gone uh and and she doesn't have any money or where do you go see where's where where's the winner gets paid\nYeah so there has to me and she spent the money a regime that what do you do\nYeah if I was trying to get someone to try to maybe help make is somebody that you go to and file and they can make myself um I\nDid back in I don't know that's not so easy to do but it doesn't matter what can happen is all the accounts are frozen once you file yes court to freeze the account but it's certainly worth talking to a trust trust in a state where I go to the website to do that because there's a lot of\nPieces on this one for sure sunny hello sunny\n[noise] probably more in the crowd at grad school to let that are no longer the LA itself okay that I write and I know\nIn Georgia well I here's the problem you're probably going to need a warrior in Georgia and there are a the law schools generally do have clinics\nWhere they do help people who don't have any money or it's a these pro bono odd organizations ah we're a law students get to work under a lawyer and get some a practice but you're going to need that you're gonna find that out in Georgia sunny\n... data that that's how they\nBecame in Georgia you don't have to call a lawyer in Georgia called the law schools in Georgia and find out if they have any clinics okay calling another yeah call every law school you can get your hands on and Georgia and then you may also want to just find out all organizations that are do pro bono work\nSunny or are you are you are you broke [laughter] that helps All right what kind of civil case do you have\nTo look out my mom\nUh this law is written or ... it was a it was a a low carbon and they say no forty thousand\nDollars is a way that I gave him a they bear it and I asked them what they read it and pay\nI pay for the for the ... coup battered I\nDon't I don't know this makes sense to you can you can get the death certificate and two seconds that's that's a public record\nYeah you're going to need a you probably gonna need some kind of a clinic no lawyers gonna take designed contingency and clearly you're not going to be able to pay hundreds of dollars an hour so called de la schools you want to look under pro bono a legal help in Georgia right\nOkay All right All right All right you know good luck to you know it's er just occurred to me that some law schools do have quite a ...\nAnd actually the lawyers and oversee those clinics are generally pretty good those lawyers are or what they do is they get paid about twenty eight thousand dollars a year to oversee the clinics and uh they couldn't ah a probably\nA so pencils on a street corner if it weren't for ah those clinics nicely said handle I'm sure I'm going to get one or two calls and say come on bill really\nAnd I will say do you have any pencils for sale [laughter]\nAll right Tom Europe welcome\nOh [laughter] okay I'm gonna get right to it [laughter] okay I worked for an employer for about three years I left that implement about a year and a half ago and\nThe for years I worked for them I worked a considerable amount of overtime during last six months I worked in an average in eighty hours per\nWeek that's allied wire and so if you left a year and a half ago Tom why are you calling now\nWell that's part of my question I wanted to know a is there a time limit\nWhere there is a statue but you feel maybe within ah I I don't know if it's a year and I I don't have the statute in front of me uh but I think if you don't make the claim within certainly there there is a statute I just don't know one year six months whatever it is if you weren't past that time you write a block so the trick is for you to contact the state\nUnderstood but my question is man agreeing to let us in July and August do I even own but the background\nBecause it's verbal it has no force at all first of all you had your soul only gonna pay me to keep it yeah first of all I can tell you I never said OK okay he's alive he's willing to throw you out if he's willing to say you have to this\nWeekend a pop off and get out of there than trust me he's going to lie about any verbal agreement any agreement you ever make its been writing he signs it\nOkay All right a verbal agreement you know the rules at this point verbal agreements mean zero and that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years to common law and common law\nIncidentally the law started not as human rights or contractual right at all it's a real estate property and the and it came out of that which is why in terms of common law that is ancient English law which show a lot of our laws derived from\nA it says that in real property no verbal contracts everything has to be written this goes back five hundred six hundred eight hundred years\nA steamy hello Stevie or you know yeah if you're on a ... if you're honest uh what do you call it phone speaker phone get off\n[laughter] All right I'm okay this is the bottom line I I I'm going to just continue my insurance\nOr with Kaiser okay and what I wanted to find out let's say my own insurance or just me working out riding my bicycle staying healthy is the federal government going to say when I Do my taxes are they going to impose a penalty on\nMe sure because under Obamacare you have to have insurance and if you don't you are there is a penalty would you give up your health insurance ... Kaiser I'm a member of Kaiser why would you do that ...\nOkay so so really what I'm the reason I'm going to do it is because guys are so go to another so by BP oh yeah\nI mean I I don't understand why you know the first step is why would you give up health insurance because anybody who can afford it is out of his mind not habit and second of all yes this at this point it is the law that you must either having insurance plan or you pay a penalty in ...\nOkay that's simple and I heard the penalty is based on your income\nI have no idea okay you have no idea\nYeah I'm assuming it's now it's two hundred and five hundred then it goes up to a you know two thousand I have no idea if you can have the penalty subsidize that would be hilarious that would\nBe all areas or because they do subsidize your insurance if you don't have the money but do they subsidize a penalty if you don't have the money that probably not\nOkay yeah so so I'm like no legislation\nNo it's not in legislation there is nothing in legislation\nBut the Republicans are trying to appeal you\nKnow they're ... yeah but they pass a law and there's not even been a war that you introduce right now\nSo this could take this one new ... could take\nA good take years by enemy neighbor passed but get yourself insurance you know please\nHello Pam yes ma'am what can I Do for you\nI'm here with the heart had a partnership with the fact that we got for nine years we take years ago\nWe had originally thought bankruptcy bankruptcy court so I was able to file on it but my partner filed bankruptcy on the stand up for me to come back after\nA well what kind of ... first of all let's talk about the business was it a wealthy or corporation\nWith the get the partnership\nA and yet they can't come after you are as a one of the partners is that you've already filed for bankruptcy you can't you cannot go bankrupt on it has it been ah I think what seven years since you file for bankruptcy\nQuite\nAll right well theoretically they could go but once that seven years is over you can re file I mean you're never going to buy any credit again Pam that's a given but you can no re file and you could refinance at any time\nSo it doesn't matter if they're suing you doesn't matter if they have a judgment it doesn't matter any ... anywhere in the process all the legal process or you can stop it cold once you file for personal bankruptcy it's over for anything that you would be responsible for what kind of business by the way we talk about Pam\nOn it but it was great because we're right back that wet during the ...\nAnd why did he go under not enough and then there weren't enough customers are wearing\nA robbery I got to my parents had to close down after nine years\nGot Rob what kind of neighborhood where are you in that was so crazy\nMarino valley huh wow\nWhy it got really bad after nine years and we get that the shut it down but I was going to be a critical that like my partner filed on it that that would have taken care of it\nNo because you have a partnership and go what happens is I you know I don't even if a partnership can file bankruptcy 'cause everybody's into your individually responsible for it right so effectively it's a it's the two of you know I don't even think it's a business it's a straight partnership where you're just personally liable\nWhy do why wouldn't you do an El Al ... or a corporation\nI don't know yeah I Do I Do yeah oh she said it you know I'm a dumb ass so I didn't have to say although I'm going to repeat it Dorsey high Dorsey\nYes yes [noise]\nAh yeah for a long

governance of which she tried you know go go down and make them sell the house when I went down\nAnd to the courthouse money wouldn't even own a house so I was wondering if uh any kind of way I could

like returning those phone calls or they're just they're just they're just fun to return now normally a yeah of\nCourse it's a scam and no they can't do it and they are in violation of the law and

they put you on the list because they've got two hundred and thirty million of those to deal with\nAnd I don't think I'm exaggerating either now I returned phone calls I got one the other day uh it wasn't even a a robocall it was well robo call them a sense of the dialing but I got a live person who I said ... ah I'm with the IRS\nAnd do we have a A N ... you're in a ... and do you have to pay and nice and you have to pay right now and I went really\nUh yes it will take a will take out a check over the phone I Will certainly take a credit card and my favorite one is we'll take our eye tunes card or apple cart that's my absolute favorite because you know the government takes apple cart apple to or I chose anyway\n[laughter] excuse me so what I did is I said really a IRS leaning it was

just read that fully half of the calls that you weren't going to get are now going to be robo calls that are now out there it's gotten to that crazy in my case it will be virtually all of the calls because no one ever calls\nI just I don't get people to call me because I don't call them and it just whole thing about how I hate people and they have me and so it's virtually a hundred percent and they're getting so good I got a call the other day and I were talking about robocalls I'm In it was\nI was stunned 'cause I I you know if you you can easily tell\nWhat a robocall is if you even begin to look at it and thinking you're in your mind because normally where you think is is this going is this a robocall once you even asked that question you understand that it is so I got a call and it was one of those I knew my name\nIs Mr handle and this is a call\nMr handle and no one was on the other end except some computer Amish are handled my name is whatever for a collection agency and then our hero clunkers you go and the woman says oh excuse me I just dropped my head piece sorry about that uh oh here we go I have my hippies back on again [laughter] it was a robocall\nThey got me they got me I did not know for the next ten Fifteen seconds until I said hello hello and they now have programs where they go she was me I didn't hear you\nAnd then I started screaming usa stupid rich and I'm ... by the way that was the least sibling I was calling a ... of course they don't have a program to answer that I put it was great fun out robocalls but no the bottom line is if you ... the IRS never makes the phone call\nCollections agencies will and you simply say you stop it you do what we do this by mail you're done talking to me they'll call you again and you've heard me say a million times use the magic\nWord harassment oh so you can say I've been a which I Love is I'm recording this phone call I just want to let you know you staying on the phone call you stay on the phone with me

absolutely no ... alright\nHenry Iraq welcomed the handling the law Yes sir\nYes bill my wife went for a for better care uh that's\nUsually where they get pedicures you know is on your feet just wanted to tell you that OK okay\nOr any any way later that night her she got extreme pain into the big toe\n[noise] and I'm\nIn the morning she couldn't even walk so she couldn't go to work [noise] so we went to emergency and that the ... part of her marijuana but it was in fact\nDo the pedicure [noise] so we gave her medication antibiotics pay pay off your feet for the next couple of days so she she got to know could go to work the next day it didn't it didn't and it got worse so we had to go back to the emergency pay their mother\nCopayment\nAnd then they cut another part of her mail and they said go through your doctors told them that they\nSee in our doctor the doctor said I Can't do it I mean just send you to pressure work so she was off work before they couldn't see the specialist or following week again she missed like six seven days by car we seen this pressure it got worse bad to remove all now\nAnd she\nCouldn't go to work again so she roughly ... ah two weeks of work because of the one creditor do we have a case\nWell yes you do the problem is there's certainly no lawyer in the world is going to pick it up and read\nA missing two weeks of work or because of bad pedicure and you have an infection and they ripped off a nail a I mean that's nothing there\nAnd so what you have is a small claims I don't even know I don't think that the uh small claims I was going to hear a small claims a a a matter of effectively a a medical issue negligence too where you were a method where she was medically hurt you can try\nAnd saying here's what happened uh I've gotten the infection of course if I were the odd person on the other side of that or if I'm being sued and I run the nail ... a shopping today wasn't me that the infection someplace else\nSo I it's one of those saying also what kind of insurance you think now people have\nA while the other thing that we thought of of going back to the salon and and telling them that\nWe're considering to sue and what they make any restitution\nOkay that's fine you can do that although I don't again I don't know how much money you're going to get so here you're damages the the work\nThat was last what two weeks how much how much is your wife went make Henry\nUh she works part time so maybe I don't know maybe a thousand dollars and the last two weeks\nShe works part time and make five hundred bucks a week All right let's go what does she do she works for a school district\nOkay fair enough so ah she's not a thousand bucks so there's that and then there whenever the co pay is on your insurance there is that\nUh so you can try I can guarantee you that uh the nail salon I don't know what kind of insurance and has\nA probably it only has liability insurance for the building if someone falls down I Am breaks a leg that kind of thing I don't think they have insurance with everything but yeah what we do is just go there and say hey you know I'm Out a couple of thousand dollars here and I wouldn't want to do you want me to to you and see what they say\nAssuming that the owner is Vietnamese right\nNow I Want a shocker a Vietnamese nail salons especially here in Southern California I\nShouldn't they carry insurance [laughter]\nYeah I Would think so and although I don't even know what kind of ... what kind of liability insurance you have for nails I'm actually yeah they sure but so what assuming I'm willing to bet they don't Henry okay so you're I think your ideas as good as any\nShow up there and say I'm going to sue you maybe it'll give it to you in trade you got two thousand dollars worth of
