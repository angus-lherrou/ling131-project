it\nAnd I'm\nLike you know you're not going to pick the right to go ahead what's your question I'm thinking the same court ... I Want to know if I can go after his like the Arctic yeah no money okay what\nDo you go after his license uh let me ask you do you uh do you know any relatives of us who have a license maybe warriors nurses or anybody I just you do some research and find out if anybody who was close to him has a a license because not only can you go after his license\nYou can go after their license\nAt for example let's say you have someone who is a a barber right or a works in a hair cutting salon you can you can take away their license\nWhite ... oh you can do is to him\nAnd if he doesn't have any money or you are and I want you to look this up as O L okay that's a legal doctrine you know that don't you [laughter] yeah you are screwed beyond screwed\nOkay ah I Love that isn't that special All right norm norm hey you handle Yes sir\nWe live in your every morning my wife and I love your chair ... to ... of it correct\nOkay to literary question tore a bill\n'cause I'm a ... times so literary I understand because yes because you're so literate yes\nI'm I'm I've written one book and I'm writing another one\nAnd then the first book we held up on publication because we were worried about we would describe a couple of experiences and hotel and it was all positive nothing negative on we were wondering if those hotels would do try and do it indoors legally because we talk about them and we give their name but the\nNo no matter of fact even if there were a negative and you give your name too do you give the hotel name out the what you can't do is make stuff up in a negative way this defamation\nOr eight or you can tell them what go ahead no no go ahead yourself alright so\nUh let's say a year or accusing the hotel and having bedbugs in your story and he named the hotel uh you know I don't want to name any names\nThe Hilton Marian Wright window which is go through the names incidentally what was the name of the hotel\nOr can don't want to say that on the air bill why they don't know who you are\nA well actually truthful and I'm not sure if I can remember\nNot faring up it's been it's been a few years yeah\nOkay fair enough by the way they're ... they couldn't go after you because uh there is a uh uh just to let you know you've heard of the attorney client privilege there is a there is a hotel talk show privilege such recognized under the law so they could not happening what laws that what you got you\nKnow I I Know what the way you can't remember which hotel I don't have it here in front of me uh when I'm sure it's there no the point is is that let's say there was a horrible experience and you're a disparaging the hotel if it's true\nOr you know what there is no defense there is no such thing as defamation to the truth it's an absolute defense by the way they're not going to go after you if you say OK their bed bugs are the people were horrible and if you're talking about a non disparaging remarks you're talking about something that's positive that happens\nI either a a sales a receipt I mean my daughter had a a very old car or that she gave to a friend of hers\nAnd\nAnd and she would make sure that it was ... she has a copy that just registered or you were going to say what\nThey auctioned off the bike and someone else bother representative recovered after have hurt him\nYeah because they impounded so just say no because you stole the bike and argue and I don't understand the three thousand dollars but a a mark here to defenses are are attacking the three thousand dollar impound vi and somehow proving that you sold a biker gave it to your body\nAnd that's all you can do and maybe your buddy will testify saying yeah ah he sold the bike to me and I saw him registering at ... I I think it's too easy to argue you're a liar on this one mark\n'cause you don't have to have the proof not that you are\nOkay I'm not at all to saying you're a liar although you do sound like one a but it's just too is just too easy to uh attack you on this one so argue that feeds you obviously you totally collection easy to go pounds ... pounds sand on this one tell them just to you and uh then you have to defend yourself it'll be a small claims to probably\nAnd then you have to worry about your credit being dangerous even a disputed has your credit already been attacked right yeah\nIt probably will our our credit yeah probably will you got a message on your hands and there's no there's no good way out of this\nWhat my friend I mean half the money to settle it\nWell then maybe you want to paint the other hand it was just negotiate with them negotiate saying I'll give you half\nThe money now\nI have and but the thing is I I needed the money more than anybody I'd rather get the money or\nCurrent well then you negotiate it on a payment you tell them to go pounds sand or you look at your credit you've got your choices none of them very good unfortunately I'm not a good place to me sometimes and I often say this is a ... everybody looks to the law as an answer\nAnd quite often the laws very sloppy that it's not very clean ah for example what's what's clean about the ... have you committed a crime yes or no\nRight it's very clean the jury determines yes or the judge determines here's a statute yes thirty five miles per hour is law went thirty six or thirty seven boom you violated see that's clean stuff\nI knew a thousand dollars you don't pay me there it is now dogs barking next door because they're too loud\nAnd I want a restraining order what does that mean\nWhat is too loud it's just a sloppy way of of dealing with things and this is one of those where the to answer this is just there's nothing clean about it there really isn't so all I can say is I'm Glad it's him and glad it's not\nMe there you go silver lining every moment okay\nOr Alexander Hi Alexander\nHer hair is are we going to do for you or\nI had a debt owed to a credit card company fifty nine hundred dollars or judgment was ... years later that judge back this up here at our receive a cat's always shut up that from the IRS showing Nineteen thousand nine hundred\nOkay when I say I view oh hold on a you a cancellation of debt for Nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars correct so you're you're a single so you're dealing with the IRS that's you're not dealing with the original credit card company you're dealing with the IRS someone ten Ninety nine you for Nineteen thousand dollars is that correct\nYeah okay so the IRS is now saying you will or you're forgiven this much\nDebt and die and they got a judgment against you correct no they didn't they sue you or they just wrote it off\nMe a original credit card company I owe Fifteen\nI understand they write it off or I don't know\nIf they did ... were you ever sued\nOr no but there was a judgment so\nThat means you were that means you were sued okay\nAll right and so uh you got a judgment against you in a ... it's a little complicated because ah they forgive me ...\nLet me tell you the whole story okay if you you can follow it a little bit\nBetter be original that fifty nine hundred I received a judgment the Ira I mean the credit card company after giving up your whiter\nChecked the IRS yeah no I understand the IRS or ten Ninety nine on your behalf because with\nAn ... for the amount that they fed I ah\nYou said Nineteen thousand dollars\nThe original ... fifty nine hundred I think our I kept the IRS a copy of my credit report showed fifty nine hundred\nDoesn't matter I don't it doesn't matter I don't care that\nReduced the IRS then reduce their mind think power than nine hundred back the fifty nine hundred\nPaid the debt off so um where my question is Trent the credit card company and white at the debt from fifty nine at Nineteen nine do I have a record\nYou know because because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars that was originally in default the point is there are no they knew that there are no damn ... but they reduce it again\nNo not them the Ira is that right but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they'd given up they're not collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no record\nThat it's only been there done statute is done\nEven though the un like the fifty nine hundred ...\nDoes it matter they and they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine not not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar where your damages\nThe question is that the credit card company and the way that the original amount yes\nThey did four times over yes there is no recourse against them\nOnly because you have not been damaged\nIf you don't mean to cut out in dollars when I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying be two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that well uh I I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars you know having you paint you isn't\nO O\nTalk we went through that over and over and over again I Would have been I Would inflated twenty five thousand dollars\nJust because the patient issue good God take me for ... yeah they do I guess people take me for a complete moron bill let me explain how this works I got it let me explain again I got it no no I I Want you to give some background\nI haven't [noise] thank you [laughter] I'm feeling better [noise] I'm

Seventeen he said he was sorry I'm Sorry for the pain I have caused\nBy his conviction and he was convicted of the crime but of course when I got thrown in jail his conviction and lack of medical license will not change his professional status because he retired ten years ago and here's the good one ah he wasn't convicted of be trained his patients\nBecause the laws not specific enough he\nWas a convicted of lying to investigators\nWho are investigating it and he pled guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice and received a suspended sentence one year\nYeah pretty amazing story isn't and incidentally as crazy as it sounds I Know about half a dozen cases throughout the years of doctors doing\nAll right uh let's say go ahead and take a some a phone calls a Ronald we'll start with you I Ronald welcome Dan on law\nOrange shirt and April I was at work and I felt when this on my right side\nThe next day I went to my doctor who immediately sent me to the hospital upon the hot water table walking ... ... I was made it into the hospital\nOver the course of the next six days I had a CAT scan ... MRIs\nAnd a spinal tap that the next day those doctors cannot determine what what's wrong with me throughout those six days or can can you hear your worst are basically paralyzed on the right side of my body after six days they just charged me not knowing what was going literary saying take two Advil calm airport is\nSo we went to get a second opinion the second doctor said he didn't see the ... from the first doctor was also an earth neurosurgeon by the way so we went to go get those are more hours but I I felt like I was having a stroke my right side\nMore touring or my ... my rights that are based on ... I went to a different hospital [noise]\nWithin two hours they were able to tell me that did not have a stroke that I had to bring a cancerous brain tumor\nThey immediately started during work I had a biopsy they told me was diagnosed with the question is if I could have gotten out earlier that tumor or not or put pressure on my brain I Would not have been a Sable I'm\nOK Now okay I got it uh so let me throw some questions that you uh during the course of those six days had the doctors a discovery or that you had this brain tumor\nOh I'm Sorry\nI yeah I Know the doctors and not discover it but those over six days to the brain tumor grow and cause pressure\nOver six days a tumor grew Yes sir and how do you know\nBecause I ... I was able to walk into the hospital ... normally stays there that was put in such pressure on my brain dark and there was on my brain damage mhm that I could not walk I could\nNot pay and I was moving I'm assuming well uh my guess is ah you left your ah neurosurgery ... surgery residency a little bit earlier so you weren't you didn't get board certified\nUm do you have a doctor that will say two things\nFor one I had they taken out to the tumor six days before I you would never have had these problems and you would be fine you wouldn't had slurring you wouldn't matter problem there wouldn't be pressure\nI don't know why I call ... ... you mean I talked to my ... well being and\nColleges it'll be a it'll be a neurosurgeon who's going to make that call and you're gonna have to have that doctors say that and willing to testify to that so that's one issue how about let's start with the second issue I any permanent brain damage any permanent injury neurological injury\nNot that I Know it's okay so what you have is you hear your damages six days of soaring and six days of walking around or not walking around thinking you had a stroke okay what what does that work six days of that\nWhat do you say I was not able to work\nI mean you might as well you must six days at work I understand there is some damage as they are not arguing that aren't damages I'm what I'm saying is what do you think that's worth\nI\nHonestly I Know yeah yeah I don't either so\nI I think even though there could very well have been ... malpractice\nI eat then there may be an argument that there wasn't we looked and or a doctor could have easily miss that ah that's the other defense that uh the first group of doctors said but you're making a lot of medical assumptions here\nThat ah you I don't have the legal right to make\nThat you're going to need some very heavy duty second opinions and it's going to get very wonky and very technical and you can bet the insurance company is going to defend this thing like crazy and you're going to need a top notch medical malpractice surgeon who's pay off will be six days\nOf you walking around like you were slurring and losing six days of work you see the problem\nRight but the continued to this day\nThat's what I asked is do you have any long term problems as a result of what happens and having missed the tumor for six days is that was caused a long term problems\nOkay and you know that for a fact\nDoctors have told you that\nYes I mean I don't want her chemotherapy\nI'm not arguing that you would have gone through chemotherapy anyway correct All right\nSo six days is all the difference in the world you'd be jumping you'd be doing a judge jumping jacks to be flying around and you'd be fine if they had discovered the tumor six days before\nYeah okay I Believe so I well Dr\nAnd do what we're where was your residency in neurosurgery let's go through because we have to put you on the stand and do we have to absolutely a
