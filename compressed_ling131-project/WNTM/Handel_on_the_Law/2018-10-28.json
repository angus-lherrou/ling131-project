I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're originally let out of jail than he is kind of you if you can test instead yet was really sorry about that then you go but it's only the people said no I'm not going to get ... and I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them didn't anyway\nRight ... ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know stuck out for their belief all the things you're told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible is such a great works of literature in place is because he tapped right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhich the or the end the population you said under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the the Halloween a ... ... ... the month long festivity of Halloween\nIs is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see the kind of bumps like that or is it just is like is it I mean I realize that they always kind of get a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this this October you know these thirty one days October\nOh mathematically I mean some of the some of his only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more ... more a year round kind of tourist impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurants than they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of\nYou know arrows and their whole started to pull a tourist and so happens their biggest one is October which will never go well\nI Do it really is I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a booth at a state fair and they can make their entire year in the weeks that the tapes as open so I I I Would never guess shops are open for one month in in Salem\nYeah but but but what the realizing is there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year that now is certainly open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums and so they're starting to realize that they can do this year round at film grows and becomes more even\nBigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem would it ... or their rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want ... just to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that as\nFiguring that especially like ... year round if you're on the other time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance they are the burial ground which was the old seventeenth century a graveyard right in the middle of town there in Salem and this year they had to put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time because it was just getting overrun and people were like using the grave as you know picnic table\nAnd climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts but that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar or inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets for those shoot fireworks\nIn the air to kind of tell people hey the nights over start start heading to the train and start having your cars so there that's\nReally at ten pm\nYeah I Believe it the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yet they're trying to get for pushing the hundred thousand people to the train you take some time so by midnight money around on Halloween of\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets Salem before the wishing our\nYeah

wouldn't be around them\nYeah I'm actually legal [laughter] of course not uh although I like returning those phone calls or they're just they're just they're just fun to return now normally\nA yeah of

with the IRS\nAnd do we have a A N and we ... a ... and do you have to pay and nice and you have to pay right now and I went really\nUh yes and we'll take a will take out a check over the phone I Will

now out there it's gotten to that crazy in my case it will be virtually all of the calls because no one ever calls\nI just I don't get people to call me because I don't call them and it's this whole thing about how I hate people in the hate me and so it's virtually a hundred percent and they're getting so good I got a call the other day\nAnd I were talking about robocalls I I mean it was I was stunned 'cause I I you know if you ... you can easily tell what a robocall is if you even begin to look at it and thinking you're in your mind because normally or you think\nIs is this going is this a robocall once you even asked that question you understand that it is\nSo I got a call and it was one of those I knew my name\n...

they seen her doctor the doctor said I Can't do it pardon me to send you to Russia where so she was off work before they\nCouldn't see the specialist or the following week again she missed like six seven days by a car we seen this pressure it got worse but at the removed all now\nAnd she couldn't go to work again so she roughly ... ah two weeks of work because of the one creditor ...\nWell yes you do the problem is there's certainly no lawyer in the world is going to pick it up and read\nA missing two weeks of work or because of bad pedicure and you have an infection and they ripped off a nail a I mean that's nothing there\nAnd so what you have is a small claims I don't even know I don't think that the uh small claims he's going to hear a small claims a a a matter of effectively a a

school district okay\nFair enough so ah she's on a thousand bucks so there's that and then the whatever the co pay is on your insurance there is that\nUh so you can try I\nCan guarantee you that ah the nail salon I don't know what kind of insurance and has\nA probably it only has liability insurance for the building if someone falls down I Am breaks a leg that kind of thing I don't think they have insurance for the other thing but yeah what we do is just go there and say hey you know I'm Out a couple of thousand dollars here and when you want to do you want me to sue you and see what\nThey say I'm assuming that the owner is Vietnamese right yeah you know I Want a shocker a Vietnamese nail salon especially here in Southern California\nI shouldn't they carry insurance huh\nYeah I Would think so and although I don't even know what kind of ... what kind of liability insurance you have for nails I'm ... yeah they sure but so what assuming I'm willing to bet they don't Henry\nOkay so you're I think your ideas as good as any show up there and say I'm going to sue you maybe we'll give it to you in trade you get two thousand dollars worth of a pedicures there's a lot of pedicures you

Ga displayed reverence over\nLast night I got into safe mode\nAnd did it run reliably in safe mode\nWell it did but it saves motives when I was trying to do these correct\nIs yeah you don't want I mean you know what he wants to stay in safe mode\nBut if you can boot up in safe mode usually that means it's something that's loading some drivers loading not in safe mode is causing the problem so so if it was completely reliable in safe mode\nAlmost always I look at the video drivers so the first thing I Would do is is get newer video drivers for your machine is is your machine from a major manufacturer\nOkay so go or you might need to do this in safe mode or another computer but go to jail and go to that area for specifically that computer you know you have a Dell um service number use that to get to the exact page\nAnd download all of the drivers for that system and re installed them sometimes that\nThat will think make it safe a stapler because any replacing those drivers with something more up today um I Would bet that is the first thing I Would do and I would bet that that's what's going on it if you so safe mode ran okay\nIt it did until I started you know trying to do some corrective actions and I was following instructions that I I got\nOn the Internet [laughter] oh no [laughter] I got it from Microsoft okay good that's getting to that is a job in itself I Know\nVoted that and then I transferred it under chrome on my on my phone to a micro book so I still have that available\nYeah but I kind of thing where they have and you do\nIs you know I was confused I'd have to go it would take me a long time yeah I Am all in\nIn the problem with doing stuff and you don't know what you're doing [laughter] you know you can really get all sorts of mischief that way um\nWell no I I appreciate that and and it's you know my wife has said it's time for you to get a new computer and I said well hopefully I Will get this done and I was thinking\nIt might be able to here's a here's the real thing to do once you go in a safe mode type uh you know when do skiing type recovery and go into a recovery mode that will let you kind of re install a windows it'll keep your data there's various\nLevels there is one level that will raise your drive and you'll lose all your data\nBut there are several levels that will let you refresh windows without racing any data and that's and windows ten has some very good recovery modes I Would definitely try those you can do those from safe mode\nAh so I I Would see you know see if any of those tools\nYou have a reset this P. C. which is which is pretty good if you do the reset this PC and choose keep my files it'll refresh the system without a getting rid of anything you want to keep you have a backup of everything\nI yeah I just yeah all my data I'm not worried about my day to have all that\nWell worst case you can wipe the drive and start over she's got a good backup\nWell the thing is I Want to replace the drive anyway within is\nA well now's the time [laughter]\nI was a great time\nAnd if it now the only problem is if it's a hardware problem other than the drivers if it's you know maybe your mother board is

insurance companies can offer the guy nothing I wouldn't worry about it\nOkay All right there you go a Alex Hi Alex [noise] whole bill yes\nI'm a truck driver and California local driver and I just had a quick question or I was doing the delivery at this place that I go to regularly and I use the restroom there plenty of times before this one particular day they told me that ah the policy change and drivers weren't allowed to use the restroom\nSo I asked them war can I go for the guy Floyd fell by they go find a port a potty that we have a ... for the drivers [laughter] so I walked around the facility didn't see the port a potty came back to them uh told them they look role you said there was a port a potty there is nothing can I usually go to the restroom now\nHe's like telling me now because you can't use the restroom so I told them you know it shouldn't be against the wall for you to operate a business\nAnd conduct business and not have restroom so I don't know where I stand on\nI was well first of all a and I don't think there is a law but even if there is a law I it he can say to the public or you can say non employees you can't use our bathroom there's no ... absolutely he can do that\nFound it absolutely nothing other than nothing a driver can do now how big a facility is is that you're a delivering to\nIt's a pretty substantial\nSo why would why wouldn't you call the uh the supervisor the president of the company and go are you serious or your boss and go are you guys serious we can't unless a bathroom there\n[laughter] yeah my mom was good that they were they were pretty uh they were pretty creepy all of them are [laughter] you know but this is stuff that we run into\nGetting ready to say so this happened and wants to you this happened wants\nTo do right and then you now you're able to use the restroom at your heart's content right\nNo not not their night they still won't let you use the bathroom there nobody uses a restroom or only employees

actually well we can have that conversation can we are because I did we talk about your boyfriend now or soon to be husband you're not responsible a perfect but you have to be a little careful when you marry someone who is financial\nA William it's some it's a statute issue and I I I I feel bad for you I really do\nWell and buy me a so I guess that kinda nixed\nThat oh that's another thing suing the VA will you oh that's for for malpractice then you're in a different world entirely but I always say the same thing call contact a medical malpractice attorney to make sure that I Know what I'm

here on calls later yes go ahead\nAnyway I have a car loan um didn't begin bankruptcy and if I call them did you think of that kind of way\nYou know not if you don't know if it's a car loan you probably don't have a enough equity in the car where it probably the car is worth less than the amount of money that's owed on how much money do still on the car\nWith how much\nYou're three thousand dollars on the car and how much is it worth\nMaybe he will Fifteen hungry\nI Know you don't worry about it now you just keep on paying it no one's going to touch you can go bankrupt do you want [noise] oh okay I don't worry about it that that\nPart is [noise] yeah and that's usually the case\nIs assets are deal I dealt with with the bankruptcy court so you filed for bankruptcy and the court looks at how much money you old versus what you have\nAnd then if it's a liquidation the splits up the assets but cars are almost never\nEver put into a bankruptcy unless you've got a Bentley or a Rolls Royce a that is a paid out and that's been paid for but other than that what you have is er is exemptions where you're allowed to have a personal car and usually whenever there was alone I as in his case\nYou owe more money let's say you buy a car for twenty thousand dollars\nA year and see you you go ahead and arrange a payment schedule I'm you finance the car well the second you drive off the lot it's Fifteen thousand dollars is value and you still owe twenty and that's the case all the way down so no cars are pretty much a left out of it so I wouldn't worry too much about that\nI how am I oh yeah yeah so ... yeah it's all you know yeah\nYeah yeah of course you're all\nOkay oh okay well if I thought well that's that's all it takes a while it's a it's a ... because a lot by the ...
