just to be clear or ... or spontaneous\nAnd people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations\nA sleep paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm and react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis well\nThat's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep you safe than than you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think you know people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as cars science hasn't told us that so\nPeople have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people\nHave they wake up in the middle of the night and they're non mall over or their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond\nThese what I call in or signals of there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience now it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you map fees when you are when people are going to these travels these experiences you mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation that has been used to map\nBrainwaves during many different altered states\nThere was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research amount of factors one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror\nAnd every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're\nThey're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about how to initiate\nObese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly\nOut a remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are talked for interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to a mind near\nThe online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In uh in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain waves which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved\nAnd again that you can tell what is what are you most responding to\nThat that that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people\nHow to have the experience themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it\nMy main goal is to teach people how to have a profound a spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking\nAnd walking through a wall and a talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have\nThe literally connect with Sarah herself with are multi dimensional fell right and have the kind of experiences\nThat that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about throughout the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have the ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and the Web site by the way it's astral info ... dot org and there are great resources on their of\nUm [noise] I I I've found as civically ways that you can take yourself into and it will be in the sense that you want to go to to do that there are\nLots of great things were going to be talking about in a second with some of your survey results the on\nBased on your sixteen thousand one hundred and eighty five responses you ... a leading came out with the um common and reported\nPhenomena associated with out of body experience is very interesting so the average of what people go through which is fantastic and you on this is free on the site which is I I think great that you really help and give the information freely so people can\nPractice especially if you have something going on in your life a problem on illness\nYou can connect to your own answer can you connect with people that their loved ones that um can you help them with the answer\n[noise] well you can definitely contact loved ones uh it depends on whether

to carry\nLike a going to help her deal and they hit the contract to have the ability nor would I get a lawyer to read the contract she gathered that she doesn't know what to do what you recommend\nOr okay here is a ... this gets a little bit complicated because clearly her damages are pretty extraordinary example\nSupport by the way of course I mean it was a theft I get a burglary of um\nUh but uh that uh the niche or whatever like that so uh she clearly has been devastated there's an emotional issue here\nBut how much is that work is pretty speculative and the jury would have to determine that assuming that goes to a jury okay or the other issue is the contract that she signed and there it is we're not responsible if someone breaks in her well she signed it however\nShe signed it while she was buried her son and then the argument goes wait a minute no one in their right mind I don't know what the hell they're signing\nIt so she didn't have the mental capacity at that time or the emotional capacity to know what you assigning threat so I Would argue that right so the point is well what's worse it's valley so the ... out there uh she's never going to replace the ring itself\nCorrect uh so what what is money what would you want\nI think part of it is that I could or twice a week and just look in there and\nYou know I understand the point\nThat no cameras or any

necessarily have to have cameras okay ah I don't know if that's reasonable or not and they had they had cameras that would have stopped the the stealing oh no it would be exactly who went out there

[noise] uh Kathy\nAkron, Ohio your next Hi Cathy ... the guy\nTaking my call thank you it's my pleasure thanks for calling I've been wanting to attack you for a while I had a private hobby where I collect\nA landscape photos and um I really like find a way tea is like holidays in\nAs like it you don't say oh how nice digital trains are usually kind of small and yeah let's have it on the base of the rain ... but I don't know how to do that you\nKnow it's funny because almost all now these uh Internet connected TV devices like the Roku and the Apple TV [laughter] have screens savers that are often landscapes Apple TV as a beautiful uh one that's a slow motion landscapes so they're moving because their screen saver\nAnd I saw that on a TV yesterday horse yeah location that I figured it was probably felt the television\nThere comes to the Apple TV it's awesome so that would be one way to do it is to get one of these devices\nAll of them have a photo capability so for instance the Apple TV if you use a mackintosh you'd up load your landscape pictures to your you put them on your apple photos and you could actually have have a particular folded let's call it my special landscape collection\nAnd you'd say to your Apple TV that's my screen saver\nHow does it get from my ...\nIts magic you know through the through iCloud it's through the Internet and that's the whole point is that you are now now this is not the only way to do it I'm gonna tell you some other way but that's one way to do it and the advantage of that as you could updated without having to do anything and just put new photos in the folder on your computer and the ...\nWay it works is you've you using the iCloud photo library So Apple the Mac is uploading all your photos to iCloud its its cloud storage\nThat yeah yeah yeah add to my talent and apple\nTV it's called the Apple TV and so the idea is that this is one way I'm going to finish until you some other ways but it's only because it's going to cost you a little money because Apple TV is a couple of hundred bucks but then the Apple TV let you watch movies and TV and and other stuff you know it's the idea is that it makes an Internet connected TV\nSo you connect the Apple TV to the Internet now your TVs connect the Apple TV and you've added Internet capability to your TV [noise] many TV's already have this uh does your TV have Netflix army right do yeah\nI Do like we we can get on you know like you I used to it and he I was on it\nOkay so it does already have Internet you might investigate if your television look in the menu and see what apps it offers you might already have a photo lab in which case you'd have to just figure out how to get photos to that photo op lots of TVs have\nSlots for photo cards for S. D. card so that'd be another way to do it requiring no Internet you copy the photos you want onto an S. D. card a little memory card on Yahoo hack\nSlotted end of the TV you can buy your TV doesn't have that you can buy little ad on devices that do that\nThe only the ad on edge state yeah\nThat's the card reader onto your TV and and a USB flash drive it really depends on the television and the capabilities of the TV but many TV's can do a slide show if you put a photo folder in that's S. D. card slaughter on the USB port again you'd have to check to make sure you do that\nA nice thing about the Apple TV is it will work with any TV that has an H y por\nRoku will do the same thing but it doesn't use apples a photo sharing service that you know you'd use some other one Amazon\nHas those Amazon fired TVs use Amazon photos and you could put Amazon photos in your back and put the photos in that and then have them up on your Amazon TV as well lots of ways this ah because what you want to do is very common I see my family photos as a screen saver for instance I might\nTell yeah yeah that would be great too [noise]\nSo you can do that with Roku with Apple TV probably your own existing TV capabilities are there are lots of ways to do it and it's in your right it'd be great way to use those landscape photos [noise]\nExcellent thank you my pleasure\nAnd if you have an Apple TV I stopped putting my family photos on their cars the a normal a default screen saver which they called Ariel is stunning\nHey have aerial photography in super slow mo a and it just rotates through everything from the urban landscapes of Dubai to ... overhead for LAX to the lush jungles of Hawaii\nIt's kind of like that opening shot of Jurassic Park you know I almost want to play the sick part they as they zoom down that valley but they do it's very slowly because it's a screen saver and they want to change it but they don't want to change dramatically or drugs the guy so it's just beautiful\nIf you have your Apple TV set up with a nice big screen that's gorgeous hey we're at a time I um\nI hate it when that happens when you come back next week we have lots more to talk about why they don't have the new Google phone I can talk about that thanks to Michael ... he makes that

that right\nHow can I say OK almost ... almost there was All right I\nI Know like a real lawyer 'cause I got an hour\nOkay by the way they act like one of the crap out\nSo you want a lawyer that'll take equity in a house the practices elder abuse and we had a phone and we had a phone call\nA ... that there was a sixty one year old man that had just passed the bar and was looking for cases and so you're trying to connect a sixty one year old with taking the elder abuse case\nNo Kay um who will take it I assume on contingency or take a a lien against or how they live about an hour\nA hundred hundred an hour now does it matter as a matter that a lawyer has absolutely no experience and doesn't even know how to spell elder law\nI don't you don't care for the lawyer has going in Marion son\nAt the bar I'll do other work\nWhat ... what do you mean you'll do all the work you're going to do all these ...\nWe knew that I Love to do it by I\nDon't want to do it then it it's it is this for you of course\nThen why don't you wait a second then why don't you represent yourself\n... kind of like well I think they only get for that group that works out\nWell let me ah sixty one year old lawyer who has never written a document regarding elder abuse in his life uh that's probably a less competent than you are my dear\nChoir behind\nSo why you can represent yourself a lot of why do you think someone who has Esquire\nBehind their name is going to somehow when the case and by the way it was a case\nDismissed what was the case dismissed\nNo I got a guy for every dollar an hour\n... ... how did you lose Mary how to how we thank you lost the case how does what does that mean recording\nNow so you haven't lost\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... anyone in the area quite I think it's a federal court now will cost a lot of\nLow I see so you lost the case and now you're appealing the case\nWell appeal\nBy the way you'll never find it a good appeals lawyer that will charge four hundred dollars an hour those guys are six seven hundred dollars an hour\nYou know because they're All right well you have the word out ... ah well you can leave\nYour name and number and if Mr sixty one year old lawyer who's never done a case in his life ever who just passed the bar and do you think you going to file an appeal now I have been a lawyer for over Thirty years you know that Mary\nWell why don't you represent a problem is I Would never I don't have the skills that to ride an appeal I Would never dream of writing an appeal I just don't have that skill set that's right I get it so but you want someone with no skill set just because they are best choir behind their name\nWell it's better than the lunar well no it's not better than you alone I'm telling you you are more invested in this you have more experience in this then that lawyer does are you in press just because someone has Esquire behind their name\nThat means nothing\nWell maybe means something but uh not a whole lot so anyway it's fascinating how people are impressed with lawyers are never get that\nAll right I agree\nThere you go higher ivory welcome to handling law we're going to do for you\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm I took

infestation of both I contacted the state of California pest control\nAnd they had no record whatsoever that this company had ever been to my own tree so they told me\nWhy would they why would they

meantime the owner of the company wanted to give me seven hundred and fifty\nLet me you know I was going on forever okay this is taking way too long so the bottom line is there in violation internally\nOr you can sue them for all the damage or based on the damage subsequent to\nThey're coming in and trading and then you know you can argue that they had not had they had they treated correctly all the additional damage wouldn't have been done I don't think they can defend even based on the fact that they were violation of the law that's probably the violation of that uh that

All right you're you're saying ah the form he's asking you to fill out a W to form or are you going to previous W to form for a previous job\nAh right ... previous ... to ... ah\nFor free from previous jobs yeah no I don't know but that doesn't have the right to do that uh because effectively what he's doing is asking for your salary and it's against the law to ask what your salary was based on it because it's one of his business how much money you earned that the previous\nIn employment\nSo no cars you know he doesn't have a right to say I need to see your previous W to form doesn't work that was\nQuick arrive at Best Buy rap\nYeah there's a particular law that says you cannot ask for a how much money someone has made previously handler and don't tell you to form a previous W true form says exactly that well so even if it wasn't on the line just saying you can't do that you say no but\nWhat are you doing yeah how about the color underwear I'm wearing a so uh no I don't think ah that works or John Hi John you're up\n[laughter] so I have a ... that hate room rent but not on our um they didn't pay 'em the amount that carried on it that they um they're claiming that there are no damage to their\nCar and so are you talking about [laughter] so you're talking about they moved out right John\nThey are in the ... that the memory now okay\nAnd what you're saying is that the damages are going to be greater than this you know or the rent is greater than security deposit correct\n[noise] ah so they pay the rent but adopted that deposit that they\nGave yeah they do that all the time All right so what's your question [noise]\n[noise] so my question and I I brought it up to them and they are claiming that on Iraq because I called and emailed them well okay ... going on\nRight okay here is here's your your your choices and I'm going to tell you just suck it up and here's why I technically they have to pay you the rent there was no question about it and the security deposit is a separate issue and the security deposit is about\nProtecting you from damage\nA particularly protecting you from damage or to the property so I assuming that there is no damage or even if there is damage what happens is they are of course saying we're going to put the security positive towards the last one threat and you're saying no you can't do that so\nYou have the right to sue them but but you have to offset the amount of money you have a security deposit as against three so it becomes a wash so so what are you gonna do you're going to sue for a wash and then the issue\nIs if there are damages beyond that and of course you sue them in small claims court\n[noise]\nYou didn't used to it then you so then you sue venue so then you have a small claims shoe but other than that no we had that before but don't they all the money yes but you have to offset so now what why even bother\nSteve hello Steve\nI Want to you sir yeah ... you know for some reason\nUh I
