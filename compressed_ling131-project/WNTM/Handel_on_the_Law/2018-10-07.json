I have a sweet spot for for homemade carpet really creative and not just you know something with a mask trapped on it\nYeah it's fine for sure um so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much can you really continue to to to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well on a good question you know I think that um you know Halloween mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things changed right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to\nWin and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we with each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like ours and stuff it's like\nScary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there is asserting innocence about it but I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed\nHum what is like a dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kid of eighty year old kid like a dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently a humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy or you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a go you know where you've\nGot like holographic oh you've got to that you got a six year that he was this giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to are asking about

say just because you have a ... that are perfectly anatomically correct for the soul use of men pleasure ring themselves why would you ever consider that a sex business\nI Would argue it's say physiological necessity for men to have sex with silicon dolls\nI'm not being hired by anybody to make that argument I just want to point that out All right let's go ahead and take some phone calls a Gary you've been at it for awhile thanks for holding what can I Do for you\nCan only do we just finished doing our own replicable living trust and I need to transfer it my mortgage free into the truck

he waited in our ten minutes for that okay so I got used to work for a station many years ago that the Dodgers rolling and\nIt was and they had a sports talk thing because the way it works with professional games or any kind of sports event on radio stations and television stations or for the most part less so is that the actual game is broadcast and then there's the pre game and post game shows that they do\nSo if you're on for example we have the\nOthers here on this station and a Dodger games are all day because it's post game pre game and everybody talks so I remember one sitting in the studio when I was doing some recording and I was listening for a few minutes or to the game\nAnd I walk past and I looked at the screeners the screen which uh that's how phone calls a come in a calls come in screener in this case Sam picks it up asked\nSome questions give you some rules that no one ever pays attention to get to the point I don't go on and on and on ... bill hang up on you of course everybody ignores that so I get to yell at you and then the call was transferred to my computer I have the same screen and then I decide which ones I Want to take\nAnd I go through it and depending on what I'm interested in what I think is interesting then uh I take the phone call up so that that was a long story to describe what happened next\nI Am a watching the screen and I noticed there I'll never forget this a guy named man well and I'm looking at the he'd\nBeen on for an hour and forty five minutes waiting to go\nOn the air and finally man\nWell is a put on the air uh okay mine well ah what what do you want to talk about what's your question about the Dodgers all he said was yours and he hung up\nI Love talk radio\nI oh there's someone who has a life right O O K uh

sir\nI'm trying to figure out how to get someone to live up to the other false advertising\n[laughter] she had good luck All right I just tell me what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that I bought from a dealership and a two years into the leaf they sent me a written a letter and also emails wanting to buy my car back and they said they would give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought there or not\nAnd then when I went and good program on it and they appraise the car and we out of the hundred ten percent of the car was an excellent condition\nOr we'll give you the deal and will give you a hundred percent but you got to buy what our cars but in their printed advertising and my emails especially especially [noise] definitely says this away rates as prepared Arbor you up to a hundred and ... percent of current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value ... you got him on that All right there's no question that this was what they said ah they're out is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is\nWhat is the value of the car or that they're saying it's not that much or they say they're just not ... not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in their ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I went ahead it appraised by car ... and then I came to them and they were the original company deals to show me the car two years early right\nIn are they not recognizing the ... appraisal or they're saying we don't care\nSo their race or came higher than ... oh my God okay so so so they ... they print it out to me and brought it up to me and then and then I said well what about the hundred ten percent and the guy will I don't know nothing about that she brought the manager out I gave him the document\nAnd email and he goes okay we'll get we'll give you a hundred percent because your car I mean your carpet showroom condition it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been particularly on at least that time\nAnd he goes it will give you the deal like what you need about when our cars and I and go after ... highlighted another thing I go but it says you'll buy micro matter but by yours or not and he says\nWell and they they just stumbled on themselves\nWell you didn't get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask\nThis uh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars or just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten per ... percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal on one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though there are ...\nOkay I have a high bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought the ... my Chrysler [laughter] I bought one from across the street from a ... a dealership from them out of that in my truck I drive thirty five of them out here in my car sits in the garage so I'm sitting here going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I was just trying to get out of the week\nOkay uh and they offered that yeah they're going to buy your car back uh and and they're releasing it too right\nYeah yeah they are releasing a too yeah yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and here's here's\nWhere I figured out the dad 'cause it's been a year and I've gone through\nAll right no I was OK all I have a a you can sell the car I to anybody else at whenever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent\nOkay well the problem was with a hundred percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on a been out of the league at that point I couldn't sell it for what that hundred ten percent would have been without you know picking a bigger hit\nSo I've kept the car and I just turn it in on a leash so what I'm really on the hook for just is eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which comes to fifty six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been to like ... and they weren't going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right\nOh okay ah but you [noise]\nWow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer and that's the problem and what the damages are and how you figure out\nI got ... uh the difference is we can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for a belief you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't have to you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent I so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are uh you can try to take it just small claims court\nI but that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and ah the formula I didn't understand it worth it so uh that works out now is it\nThe ... when it comes to math beyond like fifty plus fifty or a hundred why to buy two I have a hard time see how that works Jamie\nHi Tammy yes good morning they'll yes ma'am\nMy question and I am one of the war on earth ... on a property and I had them paint on\nProperty taxes\nFor several years can I help her record she can I put a marine that property\nYou already on the property you're one of four owners nope when you when you can do is to the other ones for their pro radish share okay\nThat's it how much and so in terms of taxes when you see several years all over the course of those years or how much you'll be paying taxes\nI probably say roughly around twenty\nA cortex is the one that I probably most often go to instead of the built in cameras solution or it allows you to do some interesting a processing who's including remove motion blur enhanced shadows things like that\nThat would be amazing the ... especially yeah because it's very easy and I love and they're always looking [laughter]\nYeah exactly and and a ... camera phones will do without telling you is a is a ... they'll in order to gather more light\nThey'll open it up or they'll slow down the shutter speed and you won't even know you're going to get blurry pictures until you look at him and go wait a minute those are all blurry yeah they don't really warn you so cortex is a good one I'm\nActually I'm a I'm going to ask the a chat room or if they have any camera recommendations for Android I actually use the uh on the Samsung I Know I replaced my ass nine with another nine actually use the Samsung up what is it too complicated to many widgets is that what bothers you\nHere they're just like too much stuff there I just want something that will take\nThese photos without the having the constant motion blur and if I take a photo outside it doesn't and it says it says a little bit too dark all actually use the flash automatically inside turned off it says\nThen I get a ... yeah so that's the reason I watch that China will listen you know you use the light that's there um\nAnd ah you know we'll get rid of the ... that that's the biggest the motions or that's what we'll\nTry try that then uh cortex and then another one that I've used for years and I haven't tried lately is a camera F\nThe five it has a lot of manual control it may not be you know they do have a light version you can try for free it may be a little bit more um fussy\nThen you want if you don't want fussy and as I did this go is still around VS CEO this go camp for a long time was the best camera out there I get another one I haven't used a while I pretty much stick to the Samsung camera\nOr on the pixel fund the Google Camera and then and then cortex if I Need so attached yeah cortex camp yeah I'll tell you thank you so much\nA couple of good choices for you and if we

car\nCompany and I'm having my question is in the car and then have the record company well being in\nA claim from the other party ... and ... and you got to it\nI didn't understand one word of that so then you go through from the beginning I write you rent a car\nYou want to extend the rental period correct\nOkay no problem there but was there was an accident\nSomewhere in there yeah because I got America because of the accident\nOh you have to extend your rental car because of the accident that you that you had this being taken care of okay so All right now what\nMy question is um the part of my insurance is paying for thirty days\nHi okay well then that's your insurance yeah the other party should be responsible for anything reasonable your damages or your damages\nAnd there is a and if the damages run that you'd eat forty five days for example to repair your car they just pay for it that's what happened to me I'll get my car had to effectively be replaced and since it's a beamer three quarters of the parties had to come in from Germany on a ship\nAnd so it was almost two and a half months and do you know the other side just cough it up now I had to pay for and I put it on my credit card after thirty days I don't want to do it I don't think you have a choice I don't think you have a choice as the other side is going to send the check out until the repairs finished\nWhat my question is like pushing white cat my inner part of the companies have filed a being just like what am I ... well ... ... my attorney\nBecause there are no because they have because they have nothing to do it and file a lean why the other it's bigger than they have nothing to do any other insurance company that's paying you\nHas nothing to do with your insurance company\nIn other words what's happening is it's your insurance company is fronting the money uh and the other side is going to pay and by the way your contract with your insurance companies will front the money up to thirty days\nRight right yeah so now there's no place you can go but the good news so you have to write a check or put it on your credit card but the good news is on the other side will pay for it if it's reasonable as I got two and a half months to repair my car\nUh yeah it took that long and in a State Farm insurance which the other drivers are insurance companies dating quibble didn't quibble I mean there are adjuster went out saw what was going on understood and just wrote the check and let me tell you it was not cheap ah repairing a a beamer\nWhich is why I'm probably going to give up my beamer

out how much a positive do you have with the landlord\nHave hundred and fifty dollar\nNow or you have a couple of choices are technically you have to pay the full ranch and then\nThe a landlord I has uh the ability has legal rights and then do walk through and assuming there is no damages then right she was seven hundred fifty dollar check let me tell you people normally do they use that deposit towards their last month's rent\nAnd even though technically uh the landlord can force you to pay the rent\nThe the problem is that he has to offset the seven hundred and fifty dollars that he has so it really becomes a wash and so just see what happens try or just call him and just tell a land where can I use\nThe uh the deposit towards the last month's rent and if the places in reasonable shape we should be OK depending on what a bastard the landlord is or isn't\nAll right All right All right there you go see some question sure why not a George Hi George ... or\n... ... argument management
