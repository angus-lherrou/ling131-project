or step ladder for him to step on and then running back and forth so he's not gonna be able to run back and forth but here's the course we did what we could do unless the law says they absolutely have to accommodate\nAnybody with de da to this college I don't know if it's a public college probably not and for example public schools here are people who have disabilities or they have to be accommodated for example if the kids in a wheelchair or the school is going to put ramps in and it gets pretty pricey\nSo um we're um I I Can't wait for this one I really can't but my favorite my

happening\nI Would be there or if it would be in your vocal trust where you're at [laughter]\nWhere are your parents no longer have any control at all to trust is set up and then it's over that's done they just don't own it which means that\nThey don't have assets for the government to grab but because they do go on I think not Medicare uh and I you know I don't know what the rules of Medicare but they're not going to let you go on the government\nDole and pay for for example a home\nOr to live for folks women with a million dollars in the bank that's just not going to happen now and go ahead

I I Am a nice it's in the club but actually club soccer yes they\nAre they so and that's how they get recruited narrowing high school anymore so ... what we did we had the special ed to actually focused on getting her colleges on to look at her\nYou know they call the coaches hey come current gathered blah blah blah blah anyway long story short she didn't we hired her it was about a month and they get on my daughter started playing\nAnd get her knees on and we went and saw the doctor and that said yeah just ... I called the company into that token to the issue and they said she said that you know don't worry about it she'll get better and if we need to do it in that chair Bob la LA Laker her senior year\nAnd [laughter] okay um afterward\nShe can't play alright Don ... says you know so I wanted to say that basically the lady didn't get much of calling right colleges and we paid a\nFine and there's no a thing on her\nFarm that says there's no refund\nIt's only a hundred feet after I ate it at that never refund absolutely\nFactoring okay All right so a is there a contract or that you filled out\nI Know it just you just pay money we paid money or how did you know how much they pay you if it wasn't written was a verbal\nIt was well no it was written okay yeah I get there when the written they\nOkay what did the writing said there's nothing about it gives you the time or gives you the amount of money you paid correct\nExactly alright like she's going to do All right ... and there's no time limit you it\nNope okay and uh so how much did you pay\nFive thousand dollars a chunk right I Would I Would sewer small claims court and here I mean because you know medical right at the medical that no it's not even\nA question of no no it's not even quite sure medical there's nothing to do with it she was hired to do something and the circumstances now make it impossible for her to do her work okay\nAll right so that's the argument shame you hired her and she no longer has the ability to work because your daughter is unable to play and there is no language of the uh non refundable a retainer\n'cause normally I Would say that if I were representing her you put down there it's non refundable come hell or high water or I get the five thousand dollars then you'd have no place to go but being silent on it you got an argument now she's going to say she's ready willing and able\nAnd you're going to say ready willing and able to do watch\nCrime there's nothing to do here and so it depends what the judge I'd give it to you\nAnd she actually tried to offer it to my son well we'll\nNever known that weren't my right and your son's probably Claude anyway right yeah yeah that's exactly\nSo he's incapable of playing and it would help if he was ambulatory I get that [laughter] okay yeah I think ah that sounds good to me that's why a good contract that I ... I just don't understand people who are in business of doing business like that we're seeing contract\nYou only changed the date and uh the amount of money that's paid why you would have a non refundable retainer why you would say this contract is only good for six months a year Eighteen months I mean that's just sloppy as hell or it's that simple\nDenise Denise yes ma'am\nRight yeah my brother and I ah my parents had an elderly um lead to a campground [noise] uh we enjoyed it um but as they are there to our my brother took it over\nDid he took it over in the east signed it right he actually accepted the contract\nIn either okay oh then undivided Leopold interests have about a year ago and said why me nine years yeah and uh\nI Can't do this because the fact that they can pretty much a gesture fee they can't anytime they want they can\nCan you know call up and find a good lawyer he goes well I got a lawyer but that I'm looking at all of them at their scams\nGoing out and you almost most of those people who are you out of time shares Laura ... or ...\nOr you know what I did one ah yeah I Know and uh I ... and and here's the problem I'd been asked to advertise\nSure there were various ... of these organizations\nAnd I've always opted out I've always said I Know I'd ... I'd rather not eat my hand be done how it can't there are ...\nTrees are convicted pedophile priests who I could not remember his name but you have a picture with him with me and the the\nThe area where you're changing the euro me and him standing there [laughter] church refusing to identify that pretty we're getting to the point where I was kind of the attorneys and the media and all that out of that I didn't want to file manning who should get a leak\nOut there I wanted to keep it between me and the short\nMike let me ask a why is it important for the second ... to be identified that's not going to bring that much more value or any more value I'm assuming you have a a lawsuit going or negotiations for money with the church correct\n... when it got to the negotiating experience from part of the money they change their tactic at first they were acting like there were some fear and nine and I said okay well\nWe get to the money um I don't even make that large of a command I went off you know but the other alter boy for federal wherever I went with us from that just to get this over\nNow are you are you doing this without a lawyer or what are you crazy [laughter] well you're craving\nLike what are you what are you doing talking to the Catholic Church the archdiocese about being abused negotiating for a a money settlement and you don't have a lawyer\n[noise] well I wanted closure and I didn't want to put my family for a years long in a trial and\nThere won't be dry out there won't be a trial they'll settle they'll settle\nNow but what you want as a lawyer who has experience there are several lawyers out there and you can just research them who uh this is what they do they developed an expertise or the archdiocese know who they are ... the lawyer will know the value of your\nCase when I can probably force the issue of the the force the issue of or the or\nThe identity of the other a priest for whatever reason I don't know if it's the purposes of are you getting closer that you think it's fair and that's an air\nAnd I and I think it was because they were the cover up that happen because oh you know who you're kidding reported of corn and of course you know it wasn't like I just ... is charges up out of nowhere\nYeah Mike or don't worry about you you have I mean you have a very valid case and then the issue is well let me ask you how important is that let's say everything else is coal pathetic let's say are you a settled with uh the archdiocese are you happy reasonable settlement under the circumstances whatever the value is\nA then how important is it for the identity of the second ... cars being molested as being molested mean whether you were molested by one priest Fifteen times or three priests five times a I Would argue it's the same maybe it's not\nMaybe there's a lot more value in terms of the case or having been a molested by two different ... I don't know the answer would how important\nA nursery initially when I went to them I just want to know me and my memories that come back I dealt with that\nI got my life back on track everything's going smoothly I married a wonderful wanna unwind got custody of my children everything is going great and I didn't want to rock the boat I just wanted to get closer I wasn't even asking for money and when I initially went there and they started to push back\nNo I I Know I understand now and say you went you went through that they're not being cooperative they've gone from gee we care and we feel bad for you to stonewall yet which is a the history of ah the Catholic Church when\nThey're actually a lot more evil they weren't just stone wall and they wanted to get an investigator and ...\nYeah that's what you do I mean my family I get it and my ... and ...\nLet me tell you I'm a big fan and I always get in trouble for this always and that is I Believe that the archbishop ships the bishops the cardinals even the pope's last several folks have covered all of this up\nAnd shut all go to jail we have a a a court room with a ... a Mahoney who used to be the cardinal here in\nLos Angeles ... and he retired with accolades and he retired uh with the ... an eminent if you will a an eminent reputation he should be in jail\nHe should be in jail for covering up what happened\nWhat I Would also there oh here's your choice here's my advice if you're asking\nI Would get a lawyer that specializes in going after the church they know what all these lawyers incidentally are the ones I've talked to were the ones I've heard of it I actually do care and if it's a question of unique therapy more than you need money or you need both and negotiate with the church that's the way to go\nOut and my question is do I get out because obviously with the climate look all these people coming our you know me too yeah yeah actual [laughter] and that's actually what would have prevented me from filing in the first place but I didn't want to be involved and the bandwagon\nYou're not going to be on the bandwagon and she was an individual\nAnd do I do need to get out\nNow the lawyer was hell no lawyer that's why you want a lawyer\nThat's why you want the lawyer who has experience and we'll sit down and give you all the options and we'll give you the options that makes sense\nTaking into account the value of the case or your particular predicament in terms of your mental health era emotional psychological situation uh these guys know what they're doing you got to go there you actually have to go there and it's easy all you do is throw up\nA ... or some uh search words Catholic Church lawyers um ride yeah law firms are suing the church\nAnd I I wouldn't put up a church or molestation kills you'll get forty thousand hits on\nThat [laughter] All right I hear it's not as warm weather out here really quick heart what\nPart of it is okay now can I included the death of my mother and I\nI

years ago that the Dodgers were on and\nIt was and they had a sports talk thing because the way it works with professional games or or any kind of sports event on radio stations and television stations or for the most part less so is that the actual game is broadcast\nAnd then there's the pre game and post game shows that they do\nSo if you're on for example we have the Dodgers hear it on this station and a Dodger games are all day because it's post game pre game and everybody talks so I remember one sitting in the studio when I was doing some recording and I was listening for a few minutes or to the game\nAnd I walk past and I looked at the screeners the screen which uh that's how phone calls a come in\nA calls come in screener in this case Sam picks it up\nAsked some questions give you some rules and no one ever pays attention to get to the point\nI don't go on and on and on ... bill hang up on you of course everybody ignores that so I get to yell at you and then the call was transferred to my computer I have the same screen and then I decide which ones I Want to take and I go through it and depending on what I'm interested in what I think is interesting then uh I take the phone call up so\nThat that was a long story to describe what happened next\nI Am a watching the screen and I noticed there I'll never forget this guy named man well and I'm looking at the heap it

back and they said they give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought there or not\nAnd then when I when I'm On it and they appraise the car and we had about a hundred percent because it was an excellent condition\n... we'll give you the deal and will give you a hundred percent but you got about what our cars but in their printed advertising and my emails especially especially that belief that this away rates are paired up are you up to a hundred and ... percent of current market value for your vehicle [laughter]\nSo interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value and you you got him on that All right there's no question that this is what they said ah they're out is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is\nWhat is the value of the car\nOr that they're saying it's not that much or they say they're just not about not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in their ... by the ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I went ahead it appraised by car max and then I came to them and they were the original company they will show me the car two years early right\nIn are they not recognizing the karma ... appraisal or they're just saying we don't care\nFor their race or came higher than ... oh my God okay so so so

out I gave him the document and email and he goes okay ... yeah we'll give you a hundred percent because your car I mean your clock harbor show him condition it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been for a two year early on at least at that time\nAnd he goes it will give you the deal like what you need about when our cars and I and I go out to ... to highlight it another thing I go but

wouldn't you buy one of their cars or just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal on one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though they're watching the lying scum\nOkay I have a high bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought the ... my Chrysler [laughter] I bought one from across the street from a ... a dealership from them out of that in my truck I drive thirty five of 'em out here in my car sits in the garage [laughter] so I'm sitting there going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr a or you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I was just trying to get out of the week\nHuh okay uh and they offered that yeah they're going to buy your car back uh and and they're releasing it too right\nYeah yeah they are releasing a too yeah yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach but just one of the damages a and then here's here's\nWhere I figured out the dad 'cause it's been a year and I've gone through\nAll right no I got it okay all I have a a you can sell the car or to anybody else at or whatever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent\nOkay well the problem was is that with the hundred and ten percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on a been out of the league at that point I couldn't sell it for what the hundred and ten percent would have been\nWithout you know picking a bigger hit so I've kept the car and I just turn it in on a leash so what I'm really on the hook for just is eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which has comes to the six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been to like ... and they weren't going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right oh okay ah but you [noise]\nWow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer and that's the problem and what the damages are and how you figure out\nA God ... ah the difference is we can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for uh the lease you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't have to and you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent I so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are uh you can try to take a just small claims court\nI but that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and ah the formula I didn't understand it worth it so ah that works out doesn't\nHe ... when it comes to math beyond like fifty plus fifty\nOr a hundred why to buy two I have a hard time see how that works Tammy\nHi Tammy yes good morning do yes ma'am\nMy question is I Am one oh four owners ... on a property and I had them paying\nProperty taxes for several years can I help her recourse can I put a
