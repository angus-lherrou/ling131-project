Jake Europe [laughter]\nI yeah I paid a timeshare company to get me out of my contract yeah I'm here yeah and uh I Am out of it but I think all they did was uh let it go to attract the sale\nThey'll delinquent and then the time share company bought or the time share bought it back\nOK how much money do you will\nUh oh I don't know anything at the moment I told them about that one gram\nAll right so you paid it and you're what you're saying you could've negotiated yourself and you don't think they'd get much right yeah so I have any recourse oh yeah you consume in small claims court saying they didn't do anything they just let it lapse and you come away I requested\nDocumentation that\nMe and they will they will soon as you file a lawsuit in small claims court for your seven thousand dollars oh trust me they are going to come up with documentation because you're saying they did nothing and they're saying oh you don't deserve any money back because we did something in your question is okay let's see it\nAnd if they didn't do anything I mean ah their letters negotiations but if they they did or didn't do as you said I Can't imagine you're not going to get your seven thousand dollars back\nOkay small claims court but yeah the right absolutely what did you get into a time share in the first place because I was an idiot guys very well say I die you beat me to it well said\nMy man identity [noise] but you know young lady yes ma'am I'm can you hear me yeah\nUm I had been working for a school district and so Cal for sixteen years um I'm part time actually it's really part time and they've done that for this reason\nI'm I'm getting ready to retire when I had taken um days off for being sick and the whole sixteen years generally taken a few and put them on the books are sick days [laughter] but um mostly I became Elaine and I'm thinking that I could [noise]\nWe're treating them at the end either take a pay out or um take time off prior to my retirement and looking into it we're getting ready to retire this year um I have over three hundred and twenty five hours accumulated and I can't take any of it\nAnd why can't you take any of it on the same because I Am part time work to less than twenty hours on it so what's your question do I have any recourse at all\nI didn't know if if the policy of the school board and the policy in which you hired is that\nPeople were under twenty or twenty five hours a week or month whatever it is or not entitled to take their sick pay\nAt the end of it uh then there's nothing you can do that's their policy and some school board some companies allow people to take sick days my police departments for example usually do\nSo uh you got cops that retiring literally a year's worth of sick leave that they pull out early and then there are companies and uh they're our enemies that say no for example uh my my company this anniversary good parenting\nIt's using or lose it\nMm same thing I worked for this radio station it to use it or lose it\nAnd they said the only recourse I could have is if I had because I'm part that if I took a different um government job was over twenty hours\nWhat I mean whatever the policy is\nYeah then it could cause it stays with me I guess\nOkay but it's whatever the policy is you have to live within the policy and it is perfectly legal to have a ... says use it or lose it\nYeah as which I Do and not only do I haven't my company or what I also live under it\nYeah yeah well yeah you're screwed yeah I can graduation so there is no case here\nOh no oh Nick [noise] ... ah I'm renting this plane and they got a new property management company and\nSo are they wrote the rules and all that good so I'm supposed to sign for the for the complex or we're going to be responsible for plumbing bills were found negligent and whatever plumbing issues are\nBuilding kind of notorious for having horrible plumbing so I just found that interesting\nUm if this turns into like a big problem in the future with something I could take a my landlord with small claims court about\nMaybe by the first thing you're going to argue is you're not responsible\nNegligent or what does that mean I don't know is it what can you do that would cause the plumbing issue rather than block up a toilet for example or I don't even know other than that block I was thinking of toilet or you know what pipes undoing a soldering on just unraveling so I don't quite get it\nAnd that did you sign the agreement with a new company\nKnow how to find in there that's too bad and you say no thank you I'm not saying I'm not accepting this\nCloud of leasing agreement or a seem to be a contract or anything it's just like grain to the rules\nBut they're changing the rules so you say I don't agree to it now if the ... says you're agreeing to what you've agreed\nTo it okay All right and so I don't know if they're asking for individual owners or they're going through the uh\nJoy board if you ... I'm Sorry on nature away if I were to apartment complex\nYou say no you say no we're not willing and then they can evict you a ... year in rent control they can and if they uh uh if a a big victory here's the problem though if there is a plumbing issue inside your apartment you've got to fix it no matter what\nIt doesn't matter it don't it doesn't matter I don't care that\nResidents to the IRS then reduce their mind think power than nine hundred back the fifty nine hundred I paid the debt off so I'm square my question is since the credit card company and quite at that data from fifty nine Ninety nine do I have a record\nYou know because because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars that was originally and default the point is there were no they they knew that there are no ... but they reduce it again\nNo not them the ire or is that\nRight but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they've given up their collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no recourse\nNow it's only heard their gun statute is done\nEven though they play the fifty nine hundred\nEight does it matter ... they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine\nNot not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar where your damages\nOf the question is sent the credit card company and play that the original amount yes they did four times over yes there is no recourse against them\nOnly because you have not been damaged\nIf you want me to ... dollars when I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying me two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that\nWell uh I'm I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars no habit you pay two thousand\nO O\nTalk we went through that over and over and over again I Would have been I Would have ... to twenty five thousand\nDollars just because the patients issue good God take me for ... yeah they do I guess people take me for a complete moron bill\nLet me explain how this works I got it let me explain again I got it no no I I Want you to give some background\nI haven't thank you\nAll right I'm feeling better I'm feeling a lot better now\nJessica Hi Jessica welcome to the show what kind

were alarmed\nOkay here is a ... this gets a little bit complicated because clearly her damages are pretty extraordinary ...\nSupport by the way I of course I mean it was a theft I get a burglary or ... or ... that\nTo the beach or whatever I got so she clearly I has been devastated there's an emotional issue here\nBut how much is that work is pretty speculative and the jury would have to determine that assuming that goes to a jury okay or the other issue is the contract that she signed and there it is we're not responsible if someone breaks in her well she signed it however\nShe signed it while she was burying her son and then the argument is goes wait a minute no one in their right mind they don't know what the hell they're signing\nA it so she didn't have the mental capacity at that time or the emotional capacity to know what you assigning threats so I Would argue that right so the point is well what's worse it's valley so the ... out there uh she's never going to replace the ring itself\nCorrect uh so I what what is money what would you want\nI think part of it is that I could sugar or twice a week and just look and learning\nYou know I don't understand the

that laughing she didn't even listen to it but I remember [laughter] you know I remember that\nYeah [laughter] so that [laughter]\nI it's time to time to contact a lawyer\nOn that one and I'd go I'd go to a personal injury lawyer because this is emotional distress on a pretty high level maybe bono maybe when it would be a contingency it wouldn't be pro bono into for a percentage of whatever and
