is apparently what Jim Costa is tweeted it's apparently legit\nAnd I'm Sorry I don't have time to show you here so I set it up the cocoa Rush Limbaugh dot com but you're on doubted Lacey this there's Fox is running\nOn almost every broadcast especially we have been covering it heavily\nI haven't been warning almost daily repeatedly someone is gonna get hurt or worse if these mobs don't stop what they're doing now the moms in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious\nPackages pipe bombs that had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and others\nUm how many times yesterday on this program there was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive putting his mailbox and I listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday\nMy seven on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love this show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody\nThis crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on\nAlmost I you can see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this so one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the halls you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces spinning it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders\n... when you can't let this continue but there's it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bangs on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws a guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their\nLeftist activist they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out Lindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news there is some truth to fake news\nAnd they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he is or racist it you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies oh the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they weren't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies are bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying now you have a few famous people\nThat have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I had been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nIt ought not be prices precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe bomb suspicion\nThere's packages sent to the Clintons home and ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters\n... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros is home in Westchester New York suspicious Pakistan to Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office they're investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder kick them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nWatching it happened to all these Republicans does any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um\nYou know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like my thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today I've had\nSimilar incidences of security in my life you know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl that worked for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation\nBecause we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen it'd be go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that but it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with report suspicious packages and\nKnow that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder is another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve ... nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations they barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people\nI I never saw such heroism it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing and the build up to all of this and everyone else has been silent\nThis isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that skill leases shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter Sean Hannity didn't go on the air and say see I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite\nI don't know I Can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters he's not responsible for that\nThe media today and their their reaction to this\nIs so over the top so outrageous so disgusting leap partisan\nIt just they're so quick to blame ... President Trump Fox News talk radio you got this NBC reporter saying that these packages shouldn't be written off as the work of an extreme as fringe but rather mainstream Republican media outlets like Fox News and talk radio\nI've been through all of it I've had you know I mean I Do I Do I Begin to tell the story about poor release I Want to hear a little while she was quarantine for hours it was like nine hours was horrible horrible and somehow we got no liberal media coverage\nYou know look at it it's not about the coverage because you know but look we just had three weeks ago three weeks ago\nWe had rice and sent to Trump mad as re Haspel\nI don't remember any coverage now in the case of any of this there were lunatics I'm going to prove that we get back that I've been consistent I'm also going to prove what you're hearing today for liberal politicians about civility is they're just words because their silence\nIn the last month over the most serious issues of their supporters has been\nDefinitely will get to that end or Thirteen Days away from the most important election mid term in our lifetimes [noise]\nWant to make your home or more comfortable place but don't think you can afford a top brand heating and cooling system will carry or has the right solution for every budget\nUm uncle Henry I'm a customer of heads heating and air conditioning and I asked them to turn to the experts carrier and they showed me carriers full line up a best in class home coverage systems\nAnd they helped me pick the one that best bit mind needs and my home budget from carriers value priced ... series to their top performing infinity system terrier banks all their products with strong warranties and\nA commitment to provide innovation and quality a commitment that's make carrier the industry leader since Nineteen oh two at carrier they make the best more affordable than ever turn to your local carrier expert\nHeads heating and air conditioning they've helped me with emergency in the past and with a brand new system that I still love call heads at to pop one six five three seven eight seven three that's to buy one six five three seven eight seven three\nDays three inches but [noise]\nIf you want to sell your home you need to get in touch with my real estate agent Sandy frost of Roberts brothers I'm uncle Henry I've used Sandy frost has a real estate agent and so has Kim dos Kim what was it like to work with Sandy frost\nIt was just cry standing on the ... ...\nThat like had my best interests at heart she talked to me about what I wanted and listened and um there's just a delight to to meet and work with is really a forthright about telling you what she thinks and trying to help you and the best way that she learned without trying to\nDecide for you she's just an honest or quite person that I immediately trusted\nI trust her to if you want to sell your home if you need to sell your home get in touch with say it'd be frost you can call or two five one six oh four sixty five fourteen that two five one six oh four sixty five fourteen or visit her online at Sandy frost dot com [noise]\nNow WN GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen they're happy Wednesday I'm Jake done from NBC Fifteen she'll be a delightful day my sunshine a high in Seventy seven\nLittle brisk though with the wind northeast at times near Fifteen miles per hour clouds moving tonight rain moves in tomorrow rank could be heavy at times on Thursday also add in some thunder your high tomorrow only Seventy I'm Jake done for this I heart radio station\nWe're breaking news that affects you we are NBC News\nFrom the all clear plumbing in France studio goals you five oh wait wait disease radio seven ten W.

be a super liberal every elected that's what they're called saying on tape you know she's she'd be\nOr if she's reelected and everything I'm just like Brett ascending tendency just like Claire McCaskill in Missouri I only got Heidi Heitkamp acting one way before an election and trying to bamboozled the people in the states\nI'm you know it's a ... what other things that I Am I I'm not surprised that but it 'cause it's all too predictable and that is this rush to judgment now that we have these\nThese what looks like suspicious packages some powder maybe pipe bombs all of this is going to be vetted out in the days to come the president has reacted very strongly today let off an opioid bill signing event at the White House\nAnd uh he was with the vice president retweeted the vice presidents or comments on the emergency and condemning the bomb like incidents and online statements as\nMedia outlets left wing politicians you know\nAround the country we've got to protect our politicians they getting suspicious packages in the mail um\nWe know that is this happened to Donald Trump's family we know recently happened uh done junior and his family we know that it has happened just rice and letters were sent to Trump and Madison ray and Haspel just three weeks ago and I frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIt though Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere\nOr it could very well be and and obviously the temperatures been hot\nAs we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and we watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is spoken out and said stop attacking Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen stop confronting people like Pam Bondi\nStopped confronting Henry Kissinger stop throwing boulders through the office of Kevin McCarthy\nMay have been watching this on a regular basis\nYou know it's a very scary thing for anybody to have to live through\nUm what's amazing again is to watch the professionalism of our law enforcement\nI mean I've known people on the bomb squad and on the NYPD they have their absolute finest in the country as they did their work today and and we've had no incident so far at all we don't know if they were alive we'll get updates from sure throughout the day\nNow the president says we cannot tolerate these cowardly act I strongly condemn all of those who choose violence first lady said as much as well\nThe president said the safety of the American people as my highest an absolute priority\nSo the full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act the justice we'll spare no resources or expense in this effort\nAnd I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and we have to send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the u._s._a.\nAnd he concluded by touting his statement condemning the egregious threats that cetera et cetera and and mores coming but that's not what you got the media writer almost instantaneously\nAlmost instantaneously some NBC News reporter named Ben Collins Soros Obama and the Clintons have been viewed as the root of all evil on TALK radio and\nFox News for over a decade when he just said Fox News and talk radio did it I mean this this rush the joke we don't know who did it we have no nobody has a clue who did this\nWhat I can tell you it's no sane rational conservative or Republican that I Would ever want to be friends with or any conservative I Know would want to be friends with\nBut it's just so typical the rush to judgment they want to believe what

that was not the case we saw that a lot after nine eleven\nWas shown it this kind of reminds me of that because after nine eleven I think it was the first month anniversary after nine eleven [noise] we actually got anthrax or at city hall we got it a ... she NBC I remember get a call from\nTom Brokaw she's producers I'm In and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now we don't know these packages these devices are real\nUm you don't know who sent them look purpose was\nUm we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms and the next two days perhaps um but I Would and and I think Dan may agree with me here [noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices says and they got that without that they that\nUh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie [noise] [noise] well ... when you get nature stuff or you know you blow to pieces gets harder\nTo collect the evidence that you could send who uh who runs ... a machine right so now you have a package it's so uh the mail or the stamps were writing the device looms side they're going to break this stuff down\nWherever how long it took to find the Unabomber I remember that case\nYeah you know what Sean tons of different times of different technologies get for no mailing list of those different there's and there's so many packages shoes or this is a benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like ... okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be right off the top of their head they're first suspect would be well might be some\nRadical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nYou know and and there's\nA lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is that devices are no don't when with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation\nIt sent the vices violence on public officials and anyone who does um is a moron and Savage I think there's a period full stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he\nWas a little more tactically a strategically devious she would send those bombs and it'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually develop a new kind of a you know the same way to put those in construct those bombs to get it was very difficult with this\nThey're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was you may have done this so it's going to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices any clues but there's a part of me that believe showing that\nThis person or persons I'm wanting to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish Sean I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices sent the CNN was addressed to John Brennan who does that work at the end I

she doesn't\nWant them to kind of\nPeople don't really understand why\nHe\nWas on the wall or was on the walls\nOf who has a horrible horrible\nShe'd do vote against the wall [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd and then they'll be able to watch them\nWhen they do they want to be like you know the amazing\nThis is now number three reticent a phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you\nA showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director in Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of Brett is an even calling the people in Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA video in Missouri we did where where they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the bottom it looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your power poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here\nAnd and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying\nIt's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states they have to mislead they have to do the moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be so liberal once you get selected that staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work well she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know Maxine Waters told us that are parties pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that if we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or right thing I was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because\nThey have to lie to the moderates they have to wound the moderates and they and they can only make one choice once what he did not have a choice\nIt's lying is this a purposeful misinformation propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do\nThey have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda and so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that Phil Bredesen hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful showing that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't it doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it turned out to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated is like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people\nLong as I Am in the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks then how wrong is it for them to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an
