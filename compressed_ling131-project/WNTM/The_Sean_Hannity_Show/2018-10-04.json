Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one number\nTo our own words that she was a ... quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before and\nThat this Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yo classmates times reported that because she quote couldn't remember then in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was

every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people and then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if\nIt was him that exposed himself and then we all watched Julie sweat Nick all third shift and backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so\nCould you have any crop rotation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not getting any education that I don't expect that you would ... and I did\nBut I Know you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite

we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there I got home from their what else did the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements to the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nIs not that was can they certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when I don't know huh\nOK okay ... thanks the fact that she doesn't run into wearing out where and when exactly it's not ...\nDon't you know you're you're trying to what you're trying to\nChange it look follow the bounds of the ... if there's four people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how

like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh that you'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday sounds\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it just you know I I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a secret people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and and not be able to really recognize that I feel like that happened with McCain I feel like it's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he may was on sixty
