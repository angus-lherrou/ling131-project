as a hurricane\nAnd if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael\nAnd it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast through Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina\nAnd then we expect at that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline kept by hurricane and the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in\nThe panhandle area and uh on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher or over a million power outages we expect to occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat\nInto the Carolinas so everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina you know you can make your preparations now and I would listen to local authorities of the telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know thoughts and prayers are with everybody in harm's way today this was this was the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's going to be this is one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's gonna be\nThe worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida\nThat's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as you head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas they're going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein oh this is really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he was involved and think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim Cole me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew the fourth buys a\nApplication to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page or the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian ... that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by\nAnd of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact it was anything but a legally expense\nNow he was now are supposed\nTo testify but those three people now Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office\nTaping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant and then hoping he can get some information something from the president\nThat could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he is denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee\nBut unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional taskforce interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and having testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it\nAnd then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he signed off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... warns that as an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences\nWell we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it\nThey knew the DNC paid for it they knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you'd think they would have figured out that the CIA was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially fights application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information pertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that Tony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate because obviously\nThey all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Wal Mart but also said that Hillary should win them\nA hundred million is zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that you have people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in the history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tech confirmed that there is no there are there but anyway then they started ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA and it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may\nIn twenty Seventeen and then they appoint rod Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing pool was now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nJudiciary Committee ... sorry the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why what eight\nEspecially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath you know and people worry about that just asked Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days we have in Arizona mix Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she is really an American war hero and ah anyway I think

David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person swearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and\nAffirmed it to be true well that didn't work out with the third renewal by the application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein and we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course\nHe's the one that recommended firing Jim call me he's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd uh now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those closed Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nAll the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that\nWe now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI Director who is under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney at the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in ad Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ on the president of United States\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nI think it gets thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured\nSo earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare members shared\nAll our bells and it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you to the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it with a ... year\nIt's so worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast off if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five Ninety four Bible at eight five five nine four B.

us insight call these men and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why that would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of calling me the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell oh hopefully I I Would I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number and you're great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say\nIs the fact that you're covering it your list interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important it is but the other part of that is is Gemini or are trying to work today\nA tea to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general much caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that\nUh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI had not a song we need to see that we need to see

... percent yup yup and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve adult\nSo the so called real too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe we have all those documents as well\nThat would include McCain number so we we need all that information and again if you're ... you're dead talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see and more importantly the American people need to see\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please too old to two to five six oh three oh\nA chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five fifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity

difference\nChange the formula the only thing worse changing their name you know my great grandfather started the from nearly a hundred years ago and we've always operate on the same principle that he insisted on the way back when\nThat won't ever change we're still going to be a local company our clients will still get the same person I service they always are seen the other day financially\nNew location sane people same formula six six six\nYou can be yeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party which you're intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox show you a racist besides just you know the the phobic phobia folk kind of stuff these identity politics and he's the Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapists line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics\nAnd for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back then I work in the back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just ... and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated or like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats are in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim you\nReally can't ruin somebody's career and their life and you know the reputation or ... that they built up and the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness they just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy damned bonds you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nAnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and so on the media and\nGreg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host and a parasite at this point\nThey're the same thing they have ginned up this rage not all but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe's been he's been called treasonous they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever ... name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and in peach Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible uh for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\nBrock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not just made up there I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add you know money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWhile I did like Kevin McCarthy introduce which has a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he couldn't make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nI don't let your books or do we write great job Greg Jared congrats on the successor the rush of hoax ... new book is out right now it Spygate the attempt to sabotage that Donald Trump that soon to be a best seller thank you ... appreciate you both being with us when we come back whether bell dot coms job of starting we'll update us next [noise]\n\n\nTime saver traffic\nIf you're traveling in Santa Rosa beach area it'd be advised that the Brigitte ... three thirty one from\nThe interests of Egypt to free sport is currently Clinton also gonna tree down in Pensacola east celebrated at ... street otherwise that traffic is pulling up pretty normally through the Pensacola area and no problems report in ... with time saver traffic I'm Lisa ...\n[noise] now W when GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen\nFrom NBC Fifteen I'm chief meteorologist Chris done hurricane Michael made landfall earlier today is a powerful category for storm what are the most powerful hurricanes to ever hit the United states\nIt will continue across southeast Alabama in South Georgia meanwhile around here breezy conditions are few showers Seventy for the overnight low clearing out overnight\nAnd we have a son filled Thursday on the way for a change with the hive eighty five up to eighty on Friday after morning lows in the fifties I'm chief meteorologist Chris done for NBC Fifteen news and this I heart radio station\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute you have to go back to much earlier in the year to find a worst day for Wall Street the key indexes had lost his ranging from three percent to ... percent as spheres set in among investors Oprah trying to trade and interest rates hurricane Michael good to have an impact on the economy far beyond the area hit by the storm\nThe Dow Jones industrial stole eight hundred thirty one points to twenty five thousand five Ninety eight\nThe NASDAQ lost three hundred and Fifteen points the U.S in the five hundred close Ninety four points lower home loan demand declined last week mortgage bankers report application volume was down one point seven percent\nThe streaming video market will get more crowded than competitive about a year from now Warner Media now part of AT and T. will launch a streaming service and the fourth quarter twenty Nineteen Warner Media has a vast library of movies TV shows and other content from which can draw\nThe crude oil futures fell more than two percent to Seventy three dollars and Seventeen cents a barrel Jeff ...
