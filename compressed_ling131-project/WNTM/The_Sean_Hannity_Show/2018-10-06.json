I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into our little but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them or come an old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know we had to draw on CNN while they are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me to get away ...\n... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman\nI Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it\nBut it's relevant Catherine McCann and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been\nTaught and heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing is bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe it\nTells what rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about living rates are also the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um a year right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claim that all men are predators but then they run to the one hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine\nCook on the phone but not better right by the way here's this ... you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include women\nWomen on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think I Am from you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written permission for every move you might get it notarized after the dates\nYou are listening to Rush Limbaugh ... voice on the right ... ... feet Mitt for\nSimply say there's another one of our great success stories fantastic protection\nSimply safe system is easy to use it takes just minutes to set up and they're no contracts you know hitting the twenty four seven monitoring only fourteen Ninety nine a month visit simply safe usa dot com to order your simply safe system now\nMy listeners get ten percent off just go to simply safe usa dot com\nFor ten percent off simply safe U.

W went actually H. T. three mobile\nOf owning sent to begin soon I'm Roger Stern Fox News voting set to begin this hour on the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will now as the necessary fifty votes debate has been going on since yesterday with Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy speaking out against Kavanaugh\nAny of these allegations whatsoever member that\nAnyway well Deborah Katz is the one that well she didn't really believe Paula Jones and she did take Al Franken side\nAnd you know it is [noise] you know you just give got to watch this it there's no end to this now they are not going to stop until they\nGet a no vote on Brecht capital that's just this this should not surprise anybody and Jeff Flake is now in Massachusetts today trying to run for president thinking he's gonna which by the way the way to do it you don't like Trump go beat him\nIn thirty six days Democrats they'll make their case\nAnd they're going to ask you to give the house of representatives to Nancy Pelosi and the Senate Democrats to Chuck Schumer if that's what you want on election night in thirty six days and you want to turn on the TV and find out the results\nIt'd be a stay home well you'll get the government you deserve we always do you want all progress that we have now\nAchieved in two years to stop that will happen too but all the senators saying well no no no we got to limit the scope it it's got to be very quick expeditious and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ever intended they want this to drag on through the mid term elections\nIn the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make is Supreme Court nomination anyway joining us now is Carrie Severino she's the chief counsel policy director for the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program well as predicted the bar has shifted\nAnd now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor poured there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now for the probably work\nI'd I'd sure they were it was in either find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee let the the the goalposts are moving faster than the speed of light here it's very difficult that could believe that any of these people and it it could take themselves seriously they said it's\nGoing to be four days a week and now they're going to hire an artificial deadline you know they were saying\nThe FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she works that that are on every Democrat that now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI are actually going to be as horrible part is an organization it out it it it\nIs and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's\nLifelong reputation here on the line\nHere Joe ... two weeks ago\nAs far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously once said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on there is someone who clerk for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to get simply use that as their excuse to discount discount them because they disagree with in any way\nOn a key is someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective on that that judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit and the lower court judge the Supreme Court\nThey saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they bought the fourteen different times they've found now they vindicate his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but but it's\nThe parents' reputation now if you read\nJames Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's pack it in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the age is no time has little to do with memory\nUm which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's the ... in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your habit very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI don't love the upper brass on the call me and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know the salt of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them\nAnd it's just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says if you look he he told me coming and low right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and his mother another section in that play book but\nThe irony is the exact same federal law provision that says it's crime to to lie the FBI is the one that that is a crime\nLie to the Senate and they're with their debts get it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that they somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people\nThe Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't ... can't force them to talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as I don't remember that I wasn't there they they couldn't be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individual ... that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because the nature of the old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new here that there there's my prediction\nIRA and that they don't have any other thing they've already moved\nOn I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link to one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cab and all was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is eating right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer with telling people she's not even still share it with him she said what part of that he was in the room\n[laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain it hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I'm I'm a tractor even counted as a credible allegation but you know what\nFor the FBI could talk to her um they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to make a whole new ones and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and maybe we'll get those thrilled to have been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and and what was said and those conversations are Carrie Severino is where those chief counsel policy director\nJudicial Crisis network thank you for being with us carry we appreciate your time

shot at you for taking my call and thank you for a continually bringing up the true for everybody\nI'm Glad to be here every day thank you for giving me this microphone\n[laughter] I'm basically all I wanted to say is is the obvious\nThis of this whole case is that um Ford is perfectly willing to do a judge Kavanaugh\nWhat she has accused him of doing to our assaulting him on a daily basis with this fall state in the first and and just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue in and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled this including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nShe gave the names of four people and none of the pork in corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it\nAt that point they were really you can't go any further with it and he adamantly denies it so it's um it's a matter of just simple okay if somebody corroborated it we'd be in a very different position today I got to take a quick break final have power\nFree for all our Sean

strong and the fact that he\nDrank a lot and so I don't know whether it'd be big discrepancy yes go ahead please can you found you know what you really had an ice right where you've had enough\nBy twenty five now till the top of the hour we're in our nation's capital the sewer the swamp Washington DC\nToll free our telephone number is eight hundred dying for one showing if you want to be a part of the program a obviously a lot happening here this week thirty six days until the all important midterm elections are my friend and colleague from the Fox news channel is with those Tucker Carlson got a brand new book out by the way it's called ship a fool's\nNow was selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution\nUm are we really getting to the brink of a revolution and in this sense I mean look it's only happened three times in the last hundred years where a party wins the White House power in the White House and they don't have losses in the next midterm election year the last time was right after nine eleven two thousand and one George Bush was president\nUm but I got to imagine people are pretty pissed off at the at is what's you know it was two weeks ago yesterday and nobody had heard one bad thing about Brecht capital\nUntil two weeks ago yesterday and look where we are getting Tucker will go to the show\nThanks Sean well yeah I mean look\nCap now is being destroyed not because if anything he did or didn't do that because he's in the way\nOf the Democrats retaining power I mean it's not personal\nIt's just the party wants what he's about to get and so they're crushing him and his family in order to get it are we moving to a revolution while I don't know what the people in charge look at the Congress look at our media they're pushing conflict in division honest are pushing racial division endlessly\nThey're pushing gender division they're claiming that the cap not soccer ... women should have men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them\nTo control that divide and conquer it's my older strategy there it\nWell you don't look I I've I've chronicled this historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans racist sexist I won't give the whole list but is that they want to throw granny over the cliff\nAnd now with Supreme Court justices or if they have an opening there seems to be no\nThere it's there there's nothing they won't say or do now I mean your friends of the attorney for professor cats\nYou know Dianne Feinstein recommended who herself is pretty radical left now soliciting people from the Georgetown Prep community whatever that is and asking if if they have information or they want to come forward their soliciting people\nAnd the FBI now is being told by Democrats well it's got to be white in scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement\nBetween a senator Coons and not enough in honor of snowflake it last week\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they fall for this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to\nDebate the details of this or that taste one actually has nothing to do with the details with justice itself this is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon centrists and Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be erased watch this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist humor is going to happen because it had to happen\nIt looked like there there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad and Missouri by the Democratic party said oh you know elect Republicans black cross cross is going to be burnt on people's lawns\nA little bit weird that all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed her silence why don't you\nKnow they're you know what I mean there are less than nine Tucker there is a is a handful of us Tucker there's not that many and by the way it is a orchestrated effort in millions of dollars

senator good to talk to you thank you for joining us there's a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished\nAnd we will have a boat on Capitol and uh I assume it's going to happen at some point this week we have any any timetable idea\nI don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement or with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware like risk but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredibly any credible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... or your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to the FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar\nSo a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is this whole bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to away\nOr the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow them and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake gonna end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do yeah are they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I Am but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but right close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then from but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize the\nWay he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of these states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swamp\nWould abandon capping off the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump with say listen this man's been abused I'm not given up on him less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly ... he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yeah most Democrats would know no matter who Donald\nTrump strides they've already against Gorsuch\nYeah All right so now what's going to happen to build\nI got to tell you I don't think anyone would even want to run for office under these conditions\nOr you know even for you taken a strong position I mean you've been mirrored in slandered about all the right people just so yeah there are people that hate me too so I feel I don't think you find that I Will say this I don't think you had a fine or moment and all the years I've known you and\nYou know we've

them near the punch but did not specifically say she thought either man's spike in Beijing\nThe Brett Kavanaugh [noise]\nYou know fighting a punch Brian Hi I saw him getting rent fellow cops clashing girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch that when the malls or the bunch campaigner is\nI don't know why he did but I saw him by by their financial remember the party's Taylor remember how I think everybody in the county remembers that\nAnd we have we haven't heard from us friends so I'm asking is are there people alive today I had a party and there are people that know about that already\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said teaches not recall a Julie sweat Nick another friend she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two and haven't turned back\nRight twenty five now till the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing after all this was was absolute how\nDoes this passport news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would think she can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... a systemic party culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged with quite luge and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then line up\nOutside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago and nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement\nAnd she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote corroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air Byron\nYork is joining us he's been running a lotta columns about there is not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote now you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron hey Sean Muslim on this on the ... thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds about it\nA war on on the basis of the lack of governance and\nUh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad but it was given in part a due to the news networks I'm hearing about Michael ... her lawyer\nSo what was all out there the fact that if it was recorded ... is probably a good correct or at least we can see what I think where it was a parent to a lot of people\n... there was nothing to this story um\nAnd when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gone to damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWell the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mrs Ramirez\nUm nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said to somebody I blacked out\nCorrect so does it look a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here's objects question right go ahead we don't want to get out of the things that he claims yeah\nI'm from an emphasis on me the sex misconduct allegations to worse he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact\nThat there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking tricare mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr as I got to let it go there thank you so much by our New

I think is a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her her country with incredible honor and distinction and\nAnd Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but\nThese numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy I suppose that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nLet it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive\nThe enthusiasm gap is as close to almost two dead even hold and you see Republicans and important Senate races now and dead heat in all of these states that are red states where where Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to do stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice Kevin off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they meet your it everything you can imagine\nAnd they lost and I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial a Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process he may well have crippled his party or a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things\nThey're called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats\nAnd he said to me I just don't think people are Americans are going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we're living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict is with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know is rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever ... nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have now sunk to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor for there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nIt took to look for anything parenthetically that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talk to the poor people professor Ford mentioned that she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happen person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eye witness that that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just going to jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's an of allegations out there I mean you just got a kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of decayed I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run\nPresident or what did he just kind of decay into\nAlmost making a mockery of himself me he talks about any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I founded painful um he he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you uh then the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that\nYou know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created four million fewer people on on food stamps or you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the the new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is\nEliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high and we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican or a week or maybe you don't even know their name is\nWhat he has put your finger on the key question of the selection I've as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\nOne of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I don't care about the polls show me the precincts I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas\nRight down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back from the special in one um and is the first Hispanic Republican state senator or in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWho this is going to come down to isn't holding it isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up at boat\nAnd if our side does show up in both I think this could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would throw us behind\nThe scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before you became speaker the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and\nAnd you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be in a dismal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology\nThat he seemed to be indoctrinated into and I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they're either going to seek kiddy happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and be in the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what what I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody cares with countries richer make sure you vote makes sure your friends vote make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm I'm not quite ready yet to project but am on to tell you that\nBecause of the intensity\nOf anger about the way the liberal smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've been looking at it but we've seen a substantial shift towards Republicans now I think that they were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and\nProbably going to increase our or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me put a fork in that race it's over\nAgain I think Kramer and it was a great great guy and I've known for twenty four years and he's got to get out there and keep campaigning\nWant one of the lessons you know I I had very close races including couple recounts and I had very big raised my experiences\nAnd I said it's every candidate do not quit 'til the polls closed and do not relax until the recount is a this is a business where things can happen\nOf malice how do you prove an absence of malice it's a ridiculous standard that nobody could ever reach\nWhich is why people like you and me whatever what people say about us we get stopped taking it\nSure looks well let me just say I think that overwhelmingly the American people do not want to reward that kind of behavior you seen it now and the kinds of surveys we're seeing now are amazing people have moved very significantly\nIn the last week and it's in reaction to out just to pick up all\nAre and how vicious and how personal or the Democrats

nation\nIf they had witnesses if there wasn't a changing shifting\nStory if there wasn't traumatic backtracking they might then have some legitimate reason to air this but because they want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really really pathetic\nIt's not fair there are ... and I'll tell you the other thing\nThere are victims people I Know in my life\nOf sexual abuse I Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole book about evil people that would ever drug rape or girl are evil

for judge Kavanaugh and if you go issue by issue case by case you know it it comes down to do we believe in the presumption of innocence due process and simple common sense or do we believe in guilt

in every single one of these cases they're shifting narratives and stories Kaylee Macedonia is with us author", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Mobile", "day": "06"}
