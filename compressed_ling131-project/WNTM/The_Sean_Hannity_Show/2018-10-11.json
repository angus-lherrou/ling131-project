know the state\nOf Wisconsin and I hope the people of Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close a we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican Kemp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well is that what fifty one percent and rats musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana can take back that state which is a red state\nThen you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana\nI think definitely Claire

polls now have her up as well\nAnd then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ... important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are gonna make a difference on election night in twenty six days and that will literally they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives\nI mean because of gerrymandering above big portion and percentage of seats I end up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats\nSo we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these tight races in an attempt to help them all out now um\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent\nIf they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it\nIf they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall if they will do the alternative health care solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera\nWere just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality\nI mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nBut if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again well you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that made I was trying to do which is prevent a hostile regime from ever having the power to turn off the picket and turn off the light blood of western Europe's economy\nIs a simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula you look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there\nA nuclear armed North Korea is not\nSomething that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be for the world\nHe got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies and on the on the tarmac for mullahs in a row\nAnd that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel

Nielsen Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz a Mitch McConnell a you know I guess the the angry mob now getting into people's faces like they've been told to do by Maxine Waters Cory Booker and others\nAnd I think Rand Paul's right that um this is not going to end well somebody who's going to get hurt or killed in the process a Danielle and it's one big lie that they go high because the Democrats have never gone high they've always gone low\nGrade at nothing ... they'll have to him and I agree with you but why is that where this escalation of rhetoric which care about\nAnd I do want to say about what he called it is this one quite as being caught it in a case he goes on to say I mean if we can anything inappropriate we don't have anything to cash and get to fight\nAnd is that they can and the radar could have prevented that people respond to I think this has now on the wealth station domestically and so I think maybe they're looking at it and when you see how far\nAre we going to get a new line but it's never been the case Jonathan I mean that's why we chronicled the separate two and four years and I think we saw the worst of the worst with judge Kavanaugh you know immediately I Believe\nI I think people that make serious allegations like was made in the case of professor port they've got to be listened to but she gave the names of people including an eye witness that didn't corroborate their story\nYeah you know the the problem we're we're having now Sean is that we don't just have the the same rhetoric that politics have every year we also have activists out there we have um\nDifferent groups like ... and uh bombings necessary be am in ... these people are actively going out and causing fear and intimidation using violence as we saw in Portland, Oregon when you combine all these things\nThe the rhetoric the violence\nThe on the ground in your face type of stuff is there going and intimidating the politicians and the speakers when they're out eating\nWhat you're seeing is an escalation far beyond just rhetoric which we've had before and even when you have somebody like Dr Ford given testimony it gets mass gets covered up whether it's serious or real there's evidence or not\nThis stuff gets so covered up by a motion\nUm and they've gotten completely out of control now to a point where\nUh there there is no truth I mean you look at these statements that Eric Holder made you can't double speak you can't say kick people and then say let's not do anything illegal that's double speak\nBut then you know this has been your party name one thing that does your Democratic Party you're below party is offering the American people besides impeachment endless investigations keeping the failure of Obamacare wanting the crumbs back of the tax cut open borders eliminating ice what what what are they going to do for the\nMen and women in this country um after eight years of failure with Brock Obama what are they gonna what are they offering what are they running on except hatred\nYou know the different again I I take great and conditions Medicare and Medicaid and care that environment at they don't want\nTo ask what are they gonna do they had eight years uh Brock Hussein Obama as president\nThirteen million more Americans on and on food stamps have more in poverty\nAccumulated more debt than every other president before him combined the lowest labor participation rate since the Nineteen seventies and the only president in history never to reach a ... percent GDP GDP Growth than a year\nYou know they had that they had the football they they they ran backwards the country went backwards now we got eight million Americans out of poverty for a million or food stamps\nFor a million jobs manufacturing jobs over almost five hundred thousand of those those are jobs Obama set of never coming back why should anybody vote Democrat 'cause all we hear is as lies negativity et cetera et cetera\nNot George W. Bush and here it ended up\nOh my God I'm Talking about what what what are they are suffering today forget about George\nBush ... that's a century ago what are they offering people now and how they change from the Obama years what did they offering besides I hate Donald Trump\nLawyer [noise] well like I said we had we care about in any case we care that\nI we got a bad line again I haven't been to China than what is it\nYou know some of the you just said a second ago about how long ago George Bush was\nIn office and they're still talking about this what I what I hear you saying when I don't hear Daniel saying or any liberals for that matter\nIs the fact that we're here and now and there's things that have to be fixed now we can reflect on the past eight years because it just occurred and we're still suffering from that\nBut we we have rhetoric in Washington DC\nThat is not trying to fix anything and in fact it's as if they are trying the Democratic party is trying to crush or the will of the American people so they can go after the constitution get rid of the electoral college change their numbers Supreme Court justice is ridiculous stuff like that and it's\nHow do you become a party that doesn't even believe in simple due process the constitution presumption of innocence how you know how how do you become a party that is now noted for\nYou you know people in your party confronting people and in restaurants women Pam Bondi secretary Nielsen Sarah Sanders you can't you can't even go have a bite to eat without being confronted now\nYou know the list that you've been doing over the past year about all this stuff to have to do with the Russia investigation all that if you did a list on your show of all the things that the Democratic party is trying to do to get away from the way we live the constitution due process all these things I\nThink people would be shocked at how much they are trying to get us away from the founding fathers instilled into the constitution it's shocking\nHow how do you run on the idea that I Want you know the tax cuts the largest in history putting a thousand two thousand dollars and and the average family's pocket in this country that's real money for real families\nThe first pay raise they've had since like Nineteen Ninety in terms of real dollars and ... they call it oh those are just crumbs but they want the crumbs back yeah I mean how do you want the crows back how many more Americans are going to lose their doctors their plans and pay you know a hundred percent\nMore yeah and and that's over the course of a year in some cases\nFor health care who wants to open borders I've been down to the board I've been in the drug warehouses you work your life and on for spent um why not just build a wall protect our borders put a big door and but we just got a check you out make sure you want to be a part of our family you're not here to do any damage\nYou know I I just got back from Ireland I went over to

... neutralize they're being they want to take away their identity they want to take away their individuality they want to get rid of borders they want to or they want to integrate all these different cultures from all these other countries with no excuses and what ... what happens when you do that people fall on the line and they're easily\nCan we're a constitutional republic right you know it's for example surreal law is and it was the glaring example somebody grows up with values that are the exact opposite of what we cherish dearly in this country you\nKnow where women are you know third class citizens can't ... can't drive in some cases a spousal rape is not even a crime and some of these countries gays and lesbians or killed for being who they are in some of these countries you can practice Judaism Christianity and these countries you know I don't understand it\nYou know we have to know that you want to adopt our values I think that's fair I got to take a quick break we'll come
