is at our website and or else [noise]\nEvery so often I'll see people on social media ask\nThe shooter hates Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel and yet that doesn't stop them\nFrom collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump\nFor the synagogue shooting but yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he is so closely aligned with our closest ally Israel\nTerror threats in this country white man most have been radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about\nIf you stop same mean things about me I'll stop and citing angry lunatics and kill you you know whether\nThe president knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly heard something that resonated for\nTrump is doing is stoking and fighting for the purposes of political power so worst amongst us to take action in his name to anybody who sits there and said that there is not causality between these events\nAny insight match is dishonest as they are\nBlind I don't think you have to be rocket scientist to rule the lines between these people and the rhetoric that has been ... by the president of the United states for racism\nAnti some I think that he's ... dollar an original violent than any amount of following\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump\nHated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel thinking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull lease on the ball field and and shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders\nBernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not it's in it's actually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rationale they would ever give if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it's it is in is what it is the biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs you know the whole lie about Russian collusion it's just what I've been saying\nThey don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for dusty a full of Russian lies\nUsed to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty sixteen it was it was used to get fired warrants on verified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own even the author\nOf the of the dot CA doesn't even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be\nMaybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east ones overall because of the threat of a rainy in Germany in the region now caused an alliance that was unthinkable maybe just a number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nSaudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into\nWhat I think is just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media they don't even see what wind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up their rhetoric that they faint moral outrage\nAbout but there are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card he said I'm a nationalist David Duke comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for\nThat finally admitting that your own life cash list and then you have a we even some Republican back ventures are that\nAre are linking George Soros and these anti Semitic threats to the caravan get Fox News talking about\nSmall pox and leprosy coming up it is I I'm Sorry I I won't say specifically white regime this is out of it go back and read your history books and look at some of the most important regimes in the twentieth century\nMight as well be certain countries talking about gypsy which is in lines up historically exactly with what certain countries we're talking about when they were talking about gypsies and you\nKnow I mean I don't even know what to say anymore you know Don Lemon last night or the night before whenever I think it was last night listen to what he says\nWe have to stop demonizing people and not leaving ... biggest terror threat\nIn the country is white men most of it I'm radicalized brought up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy banned [noise] so what do we do about that\nI I just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning host adjusting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the president so he seems to be a hero in on the two pillars of the media continuing the trail and attacks against\nAnd migrants continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to thank you think some of the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms and invaders and\nInvasion for these tragedies working at cross purposes narrative ... so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of ... migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this you know joined list may hard\nNot even on her show the view but on conspiracy TV MSNBC\nYou've also times going along with them as as cars out there who not only that just like oh I I've I like the guy in a way it was like oh here in\nNew York character cannot Republican or Democrat he's just an advocate as far as I [laughter] I don't mean that an ad hominem wet [laughter]\nNah not at all let me tell you what it means they are afraid they eat a ... look there are three scenarios as I said for election night\nWill be examining the results one week from today on this radio program and there is an unknown factor here anyone that tells you they know what's gonna happen\nDoesn't there is there's not one outcome to be very Frank with you that would surprise me one week from today when we gather here to talk about the results but I Do know this\nI Do see fear at a level that is unprecedented they never saw Trump coming they never understood that\nThe election day twenty sixteen they were in a state of\nShock and it was not only shock it was obvious sadness depression you know CNN or white lash it'll against the country et cetera\nYeah that that's not a ... it is they end up back at their head really fear\nYou the American people and what you're going to decide\nEvery race matters is four hundred and thirty five house races you vote for any Democrat or you stay home\nYou're voting for ... as the next speaker all these important Senate races Florida Tennessee Texas Ted Cruz a Claire McCaskill I'm Josh Hawley Missouri Nevada\nOr Arizona Montana North Dakota Indiana New Jersey West Virginia\nThey're afraid of what the results are going to be I'm not afraid of any result we I can deal with whatever hand the American ... people deal\nThat's really desperation I'm I'm I Can't wait to see what the what you might say tomorrow the president's right on everything I just happened to vote the wrong way every single time for the last two years\nA we have some new polls out of Florida finding the Senate and governor's races they are statistically tied a Florida is the one state I'm worried about in terms of

gave us that they give us Obamacare he'd be a doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the deficit and debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when there's Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa Sean\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages from Nancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social Security Medicare nobody's acted to cut that and then lying about\nTheir ... they're not being any protections for those with preexisting conditions and we had those protections for layers of it in our Republican healthcare though\nA lot of pent listen lying is just a part of the playbook that the Democrats is always the same I even think it's gotten worse in a look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting that took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but out they're blaming Donald Trump for it and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his strong support for Israel including moving the capital to Jerusalem wearable along so\nWe've got to take care of our American family first and that only enriches us to help others as well and we're the most generous

many other Israeli leaders Ron ... is a personal friend of mine and it's pretty outrageous that this is that they feel justified and making any incendiary comment they want\nWell that that's right and I think that's part of what we're going to cut spending selection\nBecause American people like and Kevin secret science so what's really happening in the country and the American people I Believe are prepared to work a party and the movement which has the courage to try to save the country that straightforward\nAnd so um I Believe the next two working on a great deal about the nature of America well to learn I think that a billionaire liberals can't buy elections or because the media and people just shrug off the rack and say that's not true I don't believe that\nWhy are you so confident in the election now I feel pretty good about the Senate but\nYou know I'm always I guess because I'm Irish but I always uh going into elections I always tell people it's really up to them\nThat's the case this election midterms we have a headwind against us historically speaking only three times in the last hundred years as the party in power in the White House\nOr been able to gain seats it looks like will gain them in the Senate but then we've got you know at least thirty thirty five house races mostly Republicans on defense too close to call\nI think that's right now our reasons um you know we will come from very wise there really\nAren't very vivid mind can be rebel a starting about two thousand and with the Tea Party [laughter] rebelled earlier when Ronald Reagan on a contract with America a rebellion many ways created cook\nClump then we're in for them that rebellion\nAnd the result is you now have states like North Dakota Montana on the jury or the west Virginia where there is a huge base that we believe that they're involved in a college and that causes more than just everyday politics\nAnd I think it's it's just fascinating to watch because I think\nThe media doesn't get it show up my my newsletter they'll come up tomorrow basically search on the planet side there's over\nA dozen people talking about ... ah the Mitch McConnell Donald Trump team is going to be in control center and people going to say well so I feel like every judge for the next few years would have been blocked a show\nAbout that all of those workers when Donald she's been historic animation would have come to a halt\nThe minute the Democrats control the Senate suggested in terms of ... this is a very consequential election and I looked at item after item after item on and I see that we're going to be in the Senate and my guess is\nWe're somewhere between plus three and a number I don't have the courage to say 'cause it's too high now but I can see the\nWay have you ever not had the courage to speak your mind that this is not true while you're listening but look\nI'm urging people to be cautious and and act like you're behind\nBecause I think we shouldn't take anything for granted like I Believe that Marsha Blackburn is going to win I Believe that ... going to win and Missouri I Believe Heidi Heitkamp is done I Believe that Braun is going to win as long as people don't vote libertarian in ... Indiana I Believe Dean Heller will hang on\nAnd and God help us of Christ in cinema wins in Arizona the woman who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban were Americans to join the Taliban after nine eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona\nWhich he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy I'm so I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYou know it's interesting I was looking at the different levels yeah Menendez on Perry on the state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nOr gals or when the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things and some very very unsavory\nRumors that were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nThey'll cabin deport millions of dollars that they'd like to put somewhere else but my point to get back into New Jersey because we're in a God if you can really really good candidates\nWho is a great to see you know very pharmaceutical company understands healthcare can help develop and sound practical working alternative to government run health care\nAnd um she didn't even give him may well between his own bringing people out to vote and the campaign convincing Democrats than there are so sick of\nMenendez if they just stay home\nThat may actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure it out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nUh how these things are involving right now because they're they're very ... very much in the air and there are I think people now know very rushed into us should assume\nThat this was over or you can stay home and then they feel about run out one voted to end up not having voted by election day do not do anything else go day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics and they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year um\nThe house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again as a pretty frightening thought\nUm where do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally ah I I my personal\nRange is returning the bottom of about too old for between ... and hiring them around to twenty to thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up is speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't have him in all honesty you know I've always been candid about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say do you\nI Can't either when I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that the answer you blow see what when the house\nMm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back a sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nAnyone who does not bode\nHands effectively voted for him she should be no one should kids themselves\nIf you don't want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd they're hard to have to house and people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services to the single phage it tells you how ...\nHow how could you know again she's smart lady she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks and financial services um she go down the list and you think of\nAnybody who says I'm tired of it all I don't like to know why should sort of a I'm not going to vote not voting is in effect a half a vote for him and she closer to be speaking I'm living that's\nGood yeah I don't have to tell the people there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race as important and the idea is knows is if you either stay home or you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you vote for reticent in Tennessee you're\nYou're voting for Schumer and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote that's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nI just tell everybody what he wanted to some of the claims or a moderate Democrat and struggling with relief say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house all of course and went on from that she close you know and I would have to do that fine\nTo treat them throw level if they said you owe I'm really kind of a moderate Democrat you know I got to vote for ... defeat them who's sitting here\nAnd I think uh we have every evidence because he's a team sport 'cause the radical wing of the Democratic party in control of their quality that their leadership and his his orderly and acceptable and then I think we have an obligation to ah\nTo feed them and the way to treat them as to make sure you've hump\nUm listen I got to tell you

or I think it is one party one voice leaning solidly socialist left\nVersus those that believe in our constitutional republic limited government greater freedom less government intrusion into our lives I think that is the fundamental disagreement\nWith Clinton was in a vision of two totally different American you know there there are Americans one in which we don't teach American history we don't want to be American I'm not proud of the flight no sense of who could count on emotional leave the star Spangled Banner\nAnd you know we're just one more normal country there ought to be subordinate to the un and international bureaucrats\nAnd because we're the wealthiest country in the world we're only seeing huge amounts of money to other folks because they'd like to be well the challenge the tiny chance that they don't have the money isn't it like you I mean it's it's amazing to watch in Syria's\nA these folks are and how much they would basically undermining America for the purpose of their idea unless\nThere's a lot at stake I think the most you know if you're barely pay close\nAnd the only way that she's going to get that gamble back history of California in orange county and in my district it was the first time in eighty years since FDR ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when orange\nCounty and found that Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think California races being that important but\nNow it's become crucial in terms of\nIn a we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com um that they're really focused in and which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money I'm Ken ...\nExactly yeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are being influenced by the money in the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have um a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment in forty nine years that you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years\nPeople have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we are really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear or do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era too where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you\nHad government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we had over ... fourteen point advantage on the after the the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump my big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power that forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes it particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job of the people in your\nState and in your district but the you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\n[noise] it's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now\nAnd the Democrats had thirty nine\nAnd found it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that come out of Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly get a new set a it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it\nGet to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for California and the ...\nOne of the problems that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations on high taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of and a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave their liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is that unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of that and the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future in the state of California\nI got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California you now have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats and in tight\nHe says and uh one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so uh we wish you all the best is was Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nA and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California\nThese races all will tip the balance of power and if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hold the people in those districts do understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nWell fun running for office who wants to run for office these days

is a lecture and control systems have been sloppy but you had you know groups like move on and others you know paying for a recount other ballads and they've found enough new votes\nThat were not counted to\nOr what not conducted the voters to swing the election is that pretty accurate what happened to you know\nI actually think county had more votes than voters and that is they flipped it by a hundred and twenty nine votes out of two million eight million vote\nSlow down there how did you have more votes than voters and it'd be counted\nThat's what we questioned as well and the\nThe the
