I Would I ran into um what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Kavanaugh hearings said he was a total jackass during those hearings yeah it was coming out of where I was going in\nAnd I said senator Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out at the ballot box\nI have I have a fear and when I say fear with him we got him myself but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's mafia I mean I've asked myself how would I had always situation though man of the ... that's why I say I'm a fair I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the only would come out with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response would go by what but I think they pick and choose the targets that's exactly\nWell may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this\nWell it's a it's not going to top crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk I Will do everything I can do to walk like I Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past not then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics\nWith with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display they know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrate now some people are going to vote the party regard list but others say listen I'm tired of this because out of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am ... so do you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button I and there are a lot of nicotine ms and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is going is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent cream tell him as a message to live in the black community I come\nFrom a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go\nFor what we're doing with the conservative movement for\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the all the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this\nDay but if if we all believe in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believes that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes the word or education from the Latin is didn't do could I have to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the last this authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political corps him and that's where they are and I I think the left as losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics\nDividing people on the basis of race and gender\nIs every four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white a rat race sex as massage in this Tacoma ... Lama foe but they weren't dirty air water they want to kill children and grandma throw over the cliff\nAlso they also hold I kept him out yeah and then one of the polar ice cap to melt [laughter] show\nAnd we're certainly going to pick up seats in the Senate We're gonna come close that we don't when asked me to keep it I think as the pastor Scott animal here said well there's so many a minority voters out there who are going to come around the Trump expand that opportunity he's not a racist he's opening opportunities for all people including black\nAnd I'm telling ya liberals can't stand this Kanye and the other people who were defecting from their plantation can't stand it this is exciting stuff it's I think we need to go on a positive message nationalize that these last two week how\nHow great would it be weaker transform cities like Detroit Cleveland elsewhere where every person that lives in this country has a nice beautiful house in a safe neighborhood a nice car truck\nThat they can afford a vacations take their kids to do is anyone there seven and be miserable but but they want to take their kids go out to eat and not have to worry about a pastor I mean we all want the same things that this is universal listed humanity\nYes it is I really believe next fourteen days is going to be critical for messaging as long as I'm missing stays consistent also I think that you know they're the script in the Bible says this is no weapon formed against these cell prosper I Believe some of these weapons that they formed against this nation I'm not going to be able to possibly even with this caravan I think is back firing I think that\nA lot of Americans share the same concerns about those caravans regardless of political party this year the same concerns that the Republican Party\nA share right good to see a both curry and we've got to let you go to thank you so much for being with us past are always going to stay in when you're in New York and I appreciate you being here David as always congrats another New York times best seller is on Hannity dot com Amazon dot com\nUh when we come back a tight race for congressman Ted but we'll check in with him than your calls eight hundred nine four one Sean as a number of an awesome Hannity tonight at nine hope you'll join us as we continue [noise] you're listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show we'll have more of your favorite gas topics\nAnd memorable moments that's all coming up\n[noise]\nThis is Michael ... than here with my ... from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe government protect the costs of Medicare plans will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the vast rate help markets opera's a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and say honey\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go at it won't get unbiased helped to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with lower copayments more choices like dental\nAnd vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistance is free\nThanks my this is Michael med bed for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance coal eight hundred seven one three forty forty two that's eight hundred seven one three forty forty to eight hundred seven one three forty forty two for more information\nAbout contests on this station go to news radio seven ten dot com slash rules\nGM now jumbled un GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen [noise] NBC Fifteen chief\nMeteorologist Chris done with your weekend weather forecasts\nPlenty of sunshine a cool started this Saturday but warming up to Seventy three in the afternoon and cool breezes throughout the day down to fifty three overnight under clear skies sunshine for Sunday with a high of eighty getting warmer I'm chief meteorologist Chris done for NBC Fifteen news and this I heart radio station\nFrom the all clear plumbing in France who you're going to do five oh wait wait this is radio seven ten W.

pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election\nAnyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou a showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director in\nHer Washington DC campaign office uh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she is going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff\nOne thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people tendency ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for the state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same using everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down across came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to do the moderate voters in play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be so liberal once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse overturn says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again social just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people in their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know Maxine Waters told us that are parties pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that well that's what we do it very tossed we confirms suspicions and we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at this first them and conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and ... may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to woo the moderates and that and they could only make one choice one\nBut he did not have a choice it's lying is is a a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign because they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do\nThey have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda and so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett is then hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn Web day so\nIt's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody in his staff but McCaskill\nAsk to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera toss\nWho investigated hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it it comes to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio in talk it's
