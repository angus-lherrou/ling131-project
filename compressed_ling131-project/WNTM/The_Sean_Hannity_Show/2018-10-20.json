Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they could just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth and it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope Jason you're talking to your former French and telling them to get them a get hit in to the Congress to take\nThis ad and I don't care if they're not going to\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got is the ... used to peanut first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh my God he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to\nAbout ... you said peanuts and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it or say that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... orange the gang of eight information the three oh two Z between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over ... painted materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on of course he gets a ... but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard Michael\nMr liar Simpson or all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states\nWhat's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom which we that Congress has an important issue a subpoena his court we now know that the FBI or am I stick\nAnd the G H him to conduct electronic surveillance of Americans said he said it on foreign soil without legal authority to do so\nAnd that information what conversations of George ...\nWere intercepted and in the course of the conversation they found out that out that that was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information because by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something there there is no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elites strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information is leaked out to the media creating the impression\nThat in fact there was Russia Trump collusion but they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... begin\nI is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and river the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before I'm Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition\nUh transcribed under oath or before Congress you don't have these five minute little you know after you have questions when you do this and I've been in these big go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans and you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just not fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break we'll come back

that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives upset the president saying they didn't get any tape but this time I\nAm a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing well I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out in body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but\nBefore leaving Riyadh a Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying

you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi constantly had the Saturday counseling wired they have transmitters\nAnd the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um might take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later\nJoining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisor was brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending\nThe feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan

individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that's the new often I'm an avid won regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't an American so well that trying to spin\nIt was a foreign national resident who was a common type ... you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures\nArab um the ... of the twenty first century a non ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil roof brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we're going we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen ...\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived at the cost of living that day that Chris Yogi entered and we know he ... he never exited the costs ...\nA

he was killed\nOr what we don't know what with the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to hold that they report posts for to those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think was a hundred percent right to dispatch and secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were a shoe of greatest concerns what will get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when they're getting power with poison back in March\nBritish home secretary said they needed to avoid speculation well we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here in the last thing I Would highlight is that well there were three pounds paying with needing and doing its

it to be a part of reviewing it showing\nYou know it's the I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince says denying it I'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but\nKnowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had money in the region\nAnd their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world um I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia where Don where this with that\nUm I think there's there will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nBut it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with
