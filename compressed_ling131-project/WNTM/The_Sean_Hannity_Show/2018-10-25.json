are actually are conservative state of New Yorkers\nAnd at the end of the day we may have political differences but this is one country we're all Americans ... out of many won\nAnd keeping the bay and the dialogue civil\nLaw is very very important and elected leaders who in many ways set the tone\nIs is specially important\nAre joining us now a a real New Yorker in his own right a former NYPD police commissioner a Bernie ... with us a call commissioner of commission thank you for being with us Dr Sebastian Gorka is what I struck by the way his new book is why we fight\nOr defeating America's enemies with no apologies thank you both for being here you know Bernie ...\n... you know listening to Hillary yesterday\nCompared to what you said a week ago I listen to you know Andrew Cuomo worst governor of New York history say conservatives he they're not New Yorkers they don't belong here I had every other governor in the country inviting me to move there which would be the smartest thing I could do because I wouldn't pay as much in taxes\nAnd and now yes they said no e pluribus owned them and I'm like you're so full of crap\nThey listen to what I saw yesterday you know them trying to put the blame on the president\nThen making these him as a as you know Sean last night I walked off the CNN uh they they stuck branded in the middle of our broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought it was a good idea\nThe general public some insight as to profiling packaging whatever the case may be a and then he got on for a ten minute blast of the president I just think it's bizarre I think it's way over the top I said\nThey're going to get what happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining in detail than you left in they'd send cameras following him for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then they interrupted and said that running was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name um but then he got on\nAnd he went on this ten minute tirade against the president's\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for it give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers chased me down the block trying to get me to come back we're calling me but you know what\nAn office enough already ... listen this is a time you need to unify the country like Giuliani and I did in the aftermath of September eleventh this is not a time for division\nAnd CNN and granted we're at the max dividing uh ... the audience that was watching the show\nThere is no conservative out their Sebastian Gorka none gee nobody ever\nNot being conservatives that have been you know saying things I Dream an awful lot of blowing up the White House um it's been Hollywood wants to punch the president in the face and showing separate heads of the president\nAnd those that talked about a killing the president et cetera um that's been the rhetoric of the left the media's been virtually silent it's ... it's Republicans and conservatives in\nYou know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi and Sarah Sanders now Henry Kissinger Kevin McCarthy's office a Boulder is thrown through it\nUm and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife ... you know we've been saying that we better be really careful here it's I've been saying for weeks now going back to the Capitol hearing so I was saying we better clear the halls of Congress\nSomebody's going to get hurt somebody's gonna get killed and lo and behold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted up and then those people that were silent when it's a Republican now or oh this is outrageous we can't have this kind of rhetoric this is this is horrible he can't St fake news they are fake news\nThough they are and we need to keep using that phrase and I'd also like to congratulate the commission of just doing what he did yesterday that was a cabin or moment whether you stood up the truth I I just like one person on the left who it is CNN anybody\nTell me which Republican which member abide a media all the political leadership made political profit\nFrom a Bernie saw this woman to shooting Steve ... Steve ... which Republican member of the the pop the all the media profit to personally\nProfit for his side of the rice and off the white powder was mailed to the Trump family to members of the cabinet off the individuals\nThat happened three weeks ago President Trump FBI Director re a defense secretary Mattis and and the CIA director hat all all had rice and mailed to them\nBy the way I've had white powder mailed to me a ... over the years I mean it's a horrible thing that anybody has\nTo go through we all want to catch him several responsible here are but whoever it is is not somebody that would be that we would know as a quote conservative and it's just some nut job or some lunatic on what it doesn't matter what their politics are\nWhy why is it OK why is it okay for CNN to run tyrants today blaming Donald Trump for not taking responsibility for these tempted letter bombs why is that okay when the ... Republican profited from congressman actually\nGetting shot that at a baseball field very close to where I Am spending about by\nLeft wing activist this is this is the double standards that the average American see through and this is why we're going to vote down ticket Republican on November to six because they had enough of the lives of the double standards\nKnow it's the same thing burning and I agree with Sebastian that you know it showed a lot of courage what you did yesterday but I've known you so long I Know that's who you are and it comes ... second nature to you you don't even think about it\nI got to take a quick break more with NYPD Commissioner Bernie Carrick more with Dr Sebastian Gorka and more of your calls and then later on\nCongresswoman hopefully soon to be senator from Tennessee Marsha Blackburn a very important race there hey listen I Will tell you that my pillow changed my life it just works I Love it I Can't be without it I fall asleep faster I I stay asleep longer now my pillows out Dunn themselves\nPerson falling at developing sounds down on St Stevens right approaching Celeste road with time saver traffic I'm Lisa bucket\n[noise] now doubled un GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen\nNBC Fifteen chief meteorologist Chris done with your Thursday weather forecasts still a few storms out there but the main rain has now passed us by fifty eight overnight it's clear on on friday will hit Ohio Seventy degrees\nGetting into the weekend things look good mostly sunny on Saturday with a high Seventy three up to a vote toasty eighty on Sunday on chief meteorologist Chris done for NBC Fifteen news and this I heart radio station\nThis is a Bloomberg Markets minute stocks rebounded today after their mid week sell off the Dow Jones industrial jumped four hundred one points or one point six percent to twenty four thousand nine eighty for the NASDAQ closed up two hundred nine points nearly three percent the U.S in the five hundred added forty nine points or nearly one point nine percent\nGary showing up a ... company tells Bloomberg the market could be near a peak or a point\nNow where you're no longer have the wind up your back and all have the fed and other central banks flooding the market with money\nChilling says he is looking at things like the fed tightening softness in the housing sector and problems in emerging markets\nAmazon reported after the market's closed by the sales for the latest quarter were up twenty nine percent from the same quarter last year to fifty six point six billion dollars but that fell short forecast\nThe Commerce Department reported demand for durable goods rose eight ... percent in September crude oil futures closed at sixty seven thirty three a barrel ...

but with that said um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nJoining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on\nThe differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal the more and more people drilled down on my absence record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good\nAnd we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business you know it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and\nOnce Donald Trump got elected which by the way would've never happened to Joe mansion and his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened to the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nWell thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell ya I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after\nShe said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and the more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because\nIt's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably
