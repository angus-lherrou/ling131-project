pro granny over the cliff just when you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country of pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know saying Trump cause this promise responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show a desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about polls a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking on both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had you\nWant to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat's the reason I Will tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin and he won both of them\nAnd the media nobody they weren't candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate and he goes why do you believe that and I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWhere the median again the polls came back\nAnd George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know you go back and you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty four team you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats have two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seed difference but because Republicans have the majority\nOf ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they call toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue you get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to the next president Frank Luntz was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong in twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans have and said oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival that goes in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the get government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four team Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty four team midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the G O P not only won back the Senate they did it with a ... seat Senate landslide\nNow remember is that night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but uh yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into a all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world all that but an old for it's happened in fourteen and it happened and sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a this is all white latch CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you a deep let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now\nThe G O P claimed a similar one point advantage lead in ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggested narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term and you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up\n\nTime one week from today the results come in but I just going back to Nineteen days before the Republican Senate landslide in twenty fourteen his what Nate Silver five thirty eight said this year's Senate election is closed for Republicans have the clear a path to a majority but it is a treacherous one\nRepublicans are favored in Iowa Colorado for example but not by much Democrats eked out victories in those states and picked up the seat and Kansas they can control fifty feet and keep their majority Democrats and also pick up seats from the jail paying Georgia Kentucky Republican gains in Arkansas Louisiana or\nProbable but far from certain relatively modest errors in the right states would do tricks for the Democrats anyway that Republicans picked up nine Donald Trump didn't win a single state according to the polls John Kerry was going to be president because of the polls now I don't have a crystal ball and\nI just know when we're in the fight and I just you know I have a natural gut instinct to always want to play like I'm behind play hard and the way you play hard in this case is you make a decision now\nThat you're going to vote for the Republican congressmen in your district\nCheck out my website see if you're in one of those key pivotal\nTip the balance of power districts they're the most important but every seat is important\nAnd when you vote no that if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for ...\nIt'd be a vote for a Republican maybe you're you're voting to keep the status quo of economic growth and prosperity and a strong national defense and build a border wall and it'll be a boat for any democratic senator you just voting for Schumer [noise] it'd be a vote for reticent McCaskill Nelson\n... uh Joe Donnelly cinema you

and millennia go to Pittsburgh today after the terrible\nShooting in the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday and no one in the media all the people in the media there actually blaming Donald Trump for this it's outrageous it is ugly\nIs twisted it is sick it is the family story and frankly the there's there's gotta be some legal standard at some point\nThat you ought to be able to sue for such slander and libel those comments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi\nWho watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political targeted in he's receiving hate mail\nFor saying he would welcome the president to his place of prayer it's unbelievable anyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God in a temple and their gun now\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today a loan from a non identified man swearing and angry at them they wouldn't elaborate exactly what the caller said they did tell reporters that it was anti Semitic and pro Trump\nWell the guy powers that was responsible for this murder and terror in the synagogue\nWas anti Trump and his Ron Gerber has said the ambassador to Israel as a Bebe Netanyahu has said you know they've never heard any one president ever say stand up that if you destroy\nOur friends our allies in Israel we will destroy you which by the way is the way it should be you don't get to kill innocent men women and children in a synagogue\nIt's unbelievable the ... the race the rush to politicize pretty much anything and everything that is Donald Trump\nYou know the rabbi said on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome to visit\nYou know ever since yesterday morning of the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the nation's why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre\nRose tenant friend of this program she was on with those yesterday you know she exposed\nThis is their hateful garbage a broad that it is and saying those comments come from you know some fringe group but not from it not\nRepresentative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nThe Jerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group and they want to give them any attention\nAnd then anyway anyway so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey Myers he gave a prayer yesterday that was beyond beautiful\nI mean how pastors and priests and you know people the cloth are able to lift people up when I'm sure they themselves are just dying inside I don't know\nIt takes a very special anointed person to be that kind of person Donald Trump's my president the president of the United states is always welcome to visit\nStore\nKnow you could see the hostility about all things conservative and Republican you know I call for security and peace and people do take out their differences at the ballot box\nBut that doesn't stop them they're so desperate\nWhile but you got you running for Rick Scott's seat Rick Scott a would love to see him we did a great job as governor of Florida and I love to see him go to the U.S Senate that too is a tight race\nLet's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved\nWell this guy was posing as a developer a he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that than it legal gift ended up itself Andrew never ordered it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby a buddy of Andrew saying really appreciate the mayor coming through ah why\nWas arrested isn't that buying influence in corruption\nWell there is an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's gonna happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arranged the New York junk get paid for for night staying in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaigned on twenty sixteen that was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you can't report after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks so CYA so I don't even want to say that reported\nAt all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and in in a response to those subpoenas or one of the lobbyist attorneys release that to the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation\nBut Sean you tell me what other reason what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago it was the political reported that apparently his running mate you know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross\nAnd read the text message to you know apparently it snow out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark and er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew get one picked this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum he is aligned himself with some of the most in Israel and the anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders which is a leader and the boycott divest been sanctioned movement\nTargeting Israel they actually say Israel but genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day opposed to having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and when\nA Israel fought back against the mob attacks in may a deal and blamed Israelis do they just use those attacks as a pre K. it'd be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is really ... organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the
