ten years to sell their name brand products in Canada before they go generic\nWell that's up two years that's billions of dollars in many cases\nThere is no increased protections on intellectual

it just wasn't me so he's he's not calling her a liar or what he has a centrally doing is saying she is mistaken\nA variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals' or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\nAlmost ... ...\n... ... and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was a very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's going to blame them and I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them and by ... somebody told him quit holding back\nOr he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said why she was ... she was initially believe well she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified and he totally indicated itself it was a mass or because I think it was thought that it\n... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up to Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said when Dianne Feinstein did is\nTo everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when the American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida\nI'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no face\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned this family has been bludgeoned and there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds no plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give\nA valid reason to senators like Murkowski in Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of Kavanaugh but I find it amazing to me\nA vet were holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school and college as a lead shift I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard in some of these allegations chili sweat Nick\nAre preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit ah in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the view which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and now she well he was near the punch bowl and well he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else\nI mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time or we don't believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer\nNobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no it's go ahead David\nWell I I I find that again absurd on its face as you said just as I Do uh the the sweat Nick ... while the other sweating the allegations that just doesn't hold true and I think following up on what you said\nAnd it doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held a pay after one and it for sure after multiple crime this doesn't hold true but in response to something you said earlier\nWhat we do taking this in the mid term hits the FBI I'm something really damning which I truly that nothing will change the fact that the Democrats have acted in bad thing\nEither way and the people to know that what they've done is way except that uh and pernicious and I think the public is is outraged and I think they're going to punish the Democrat and in the mid term what I Do think though is we'd be much better off with a victory\nAnd and the Democrats had they acted the way they have than a loss and them having acted the way they have because what Trump stands for is fighting and ultimately winning and we we always blame our losses\nStarting immobile today on Florida Street between old shell ready with an imaging with time saver trying to think I'm

networks um thing about Michael I haven't had any her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people are there just was nothing to this story [noise]\nUm and when she offered a witnesses to corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nOn the other was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already done the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the

FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is this whole bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to elect\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named\nMess for ... isn't there any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow them and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake gonna end up voting in this I have no what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do\nOr they are your colleagues maybe you have some more insight than I Am but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but right close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delete legitimize\nThe way he was treated if the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with their senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact most Democrats wouldn't know no matter who Donald\nTrump test ride they've already against score six\nYeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question Martha ... is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction\nI Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited\n... that would show that that are ... for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter]\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond doubt\nI doubt if they're lifting [laughter] I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the future of the judiciary\nThe stays couldn't be higher this about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here\nI think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or a political scientist I don't care there's like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just on a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge\nDeserves I think ... [noise] yes no I think they handled properly because these are serious allegations but\nShe identified in and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Kevin\n... those are the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or a conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage it as the homophobic Xena ...
