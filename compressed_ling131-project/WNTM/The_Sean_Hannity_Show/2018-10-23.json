Hannity dot com the fifty house races that will tip the balance of power in the house of representatives now on the Senate side look it's very tight and Florida there's no other way to describe it\nFlorida's always title unfortunately but you've got Rick Scott who's looking to unseat a Nelson\nAs the you know basically the Schumer of Florida\nAnd rich got things done a great job in the state of Florida as a governor and you've got the mister tax and spend is also an article you see all these articles about the FBI and an investigations into Gillum and who is getting it's getting interesting in that case\nA but there's a lot out there about him you know Tampa Bay times shows that records show FBI agents gave Andrew Gillum tickets to Hamilton and twenty sixteen isn't that nice\nYeah well he's got ... investigations of him going on and he wants to forty percent tax for the people of Florida\nIt will destroy the economy of Florida so I don't know which way Florida is

thinking Marsha Blackburn is going to hold that seat I'm pretty confident that the people of Missouri or a little sick and tired of\nOf clear Schumer McCaskill because she's a reliable hundred percent vote for sure every time and they're probably sick and tired of the fact that she too in her office to got caught on tape they're lying to the people in Missouri bragging behind the scenes how she's just like Obama\nI'm pretty sure that Heidi Heitkamp I mean is done in North Dakota I mean do you see that she recently released into the name of a sexual assault victims trying to\nYou know in an ad that she's running anyway we've never seen a mid term race like that before and I'm pretty sure listen I think if the people in Nevada get out you can save Dean Heller he's up a little bit in the polls but that's always a tight state for Republicans you got to have to get out there and vote\nI saw a buddy Tarkanian as a kid is running out there is a great guy I'm so and I'm pretty sure that you know cinema in Arizona I mean it is there anything else she wants to say about how horrible the people she's asking to vote for our\nMeth capital of democracy you know inviting radical speakers that that represent the blind shake that were accused of actually you know passing on his messages to other crazy people that don't like this country\nAnd then of course ah oh it's okay to join the

power in the house\nMinnesota's going to play a big role in the balance of power in the house Michigan's going to play a big role Ohio is going to play a big role Warren is going to play a big role every state in the union\nI mean there's listen if Nate Silver saying eighty six percent and he looks so bad after the last election now part of this I always believe is to deflate enthusiasm on our side you don't have to listen to the pollsters I don't listen to the pollsters\nLast uh last November or twenty sixteen in November of five Fifteen I got the exit polls\nThose exit poll showed that Donald Trump didn't win a single state he lost Florida lost Ohio he lost North Carolina he lost ... lost was constantly last Pennsylvania\nAnd he may have lost like every other red state that's what the poll showed the same thing in two thousand and four John Kerry the exit polls by Fifteen eastern time on election day in ... for John Kerry was going to be the next president so these polls these calculations they're basically somebody else's best gas\nSo don't take any of the Senate races for granted where we think we're ahead and don't take the fact that\nYou know Nancy Pelosi is picking out

next anointed one it is dying to find the right person okay what give me your best shot at the bottom line is if they really cared about the issue as they said they did\nWell then Cory Booker would be under investigation because those allegations made about an assault this weekend about am\nNever mind what he had already admitted he did on his own on top of Keith Ellison he would have been investigated not one of the these Democrats have called for an investigation\nI don't know if any of its true the person that seems the most credible here is this woman Monaghan who\nDated Keith

trust these people that make their predictions\nYou know I follow I I look at it I factor it into what my thinking is I actually think that we should act right now that every race every Republican is behind\nAnd know that if the Democrat wins for the house that that's a vote for polo see staying home as I have a vote for below sea\nAnd in every important Senate race be at Florida or be a Tennessee

be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it's a it's not going to top crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do

or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past just caught then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and past and what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nThey're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display they know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for a better job they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarded as but others say listen I'm tired of this because out of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I ... so do you know they said well we don't like\nThe some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you're you're propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixteen was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button I and there are a lot of nicotine ms and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent cream tell him as a message to live in the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really up for\nWhat we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all\nBelieve in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right on okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes the the word education from the Latin is in ... to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again he means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that but I think the left as\nAuthoritarian by nature who their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left as losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the
