the truth about what they were trying to do to Donald Trump that'll be breaking this week we'll get a preview straight ahead [noise]\n\nYou suffer from E. D. and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know it can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle what if I told you that a certain little\nAnd those are the conversations between Bruce Oren Christopher Steele and we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann and Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a liquor Im south anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some document we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents\nFor the department of justice from but some of the keys documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of what was Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting a immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel\nAnd are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true\nAh I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents would've been requesting for quite some time are made public so as a result of that of is when you've\nIf they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday and this week\nWe are going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page tax ah\nThe ah the the Bruce or three oh one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's in the middle of all of this\nAnd I said do you know what the news is tomorrow you getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere there there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan and a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president\nI'm hearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be the brief by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yeah and then by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other into\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trust that you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted ... to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy\nTo share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah what was pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hostile regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that who does have a network of\nOf their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talked about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead at the\nDNC ever get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a Rome people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington\nWho we're paying for these ah these operations in you know soon thereafter at that I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd this is a first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ... I first started getting phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ... ...\nThat they had the spies a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't\n... I think my first ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's when we said wait a minute there is a buys a warrant on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at\nThe time ... it's funny Sean writes a interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know and these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they again because it's all about you know media perception\nWhat were they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged right\nAbsolutely well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and again the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right at the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... a lot about\nThat did they ask you specifics about that does say\nYeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of revolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there is a an indictment of ... or ... you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so\nAnd we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties have got to be some records\nFor you well I'd definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that it's created for the Trump Administration and the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you should write a book\nWhat it's like to be spied on by your government you know something about um serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like because I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you ... you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time\nBasically yeah and you know going back many years again at and we had talked about how many hours\nTotal do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spent\nTotal over the last two years out of the last two decades two years last two years well I mean in terms of actual in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours I had to do in terms of documents production etcetera right now that's a whole different level\nI fully agree Sean and one of the big ... problems as you're alluding to is secrecy no right so much as just undercover and\nYou know and even as funny over those ten plus hours of lab in last March when I was talking with the FBI agents\nYou know eventually they were asking me a lot of questions and then as as we went further and further into the interviews towards the end of the er the long conversations they started saying well our bosses doesn't want to [laughter] you know and they I think they saw through it but they knew you know that was back during the\n... era as maybe one of the lessons never go visit Russia ever [laughter] don't go to Vladimir ... Russia stay out well President Trump has done a lot\nTo fix that situation I think you know those are his his courage I I'm inspired by that and I think there's even that it's going to be fixed overtime I'm confident Carter\nPage thanks for being with us we always appreciate you being here eight hundred ... a number thank you sir\n[noise]\n\nTime saver traffic\nDown for an accident in Louisville on government street at Morgan avenue just east of clean hill drunk and also in the bar was an accident with\nRed blockage on highway Ninety eight near edge would dry and also watch forcing filling developing southbound on one sixty five approaching Bay Bridge or the time they were trying to think I'm ...\nNow WN GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC fifty a very sad BC Fifteen chief meteorologist\nFor sun with a look at your weather forecasts on this Monday of course\nA lot of folks are talking about hurricane Michael making a move into the Gulf of Mexico and it will have an impact on our weather immobile in Baldwin county is probably more of an impact in northwest Florida\nSeventy two are low tonight up to eighty four on Tuesday to on Wednesday and a potential landfall looks like on Wednesday afternoon most likely in northwest Florida however don't let your guard down just yet I'm chief meteorologist Chris done for NBC Fifteen news and this I heart radio station\nIs is a Bloomberg market next after ... lost his on friday while she gets a partial when\nThe Gallup thirty nine points to twenty six thousand four eighty six and I sat down fifty two more than one half percent to Seventy seven thirty sects enhancing the down one point to twenty eight eighty four ... factor was especially hard hit and Google was among the worst performers that chance it will shut down at Google Plus social network\nAfter security flaws decade as many as five hundred thousand users to Wall Street journal reports Google knew about it last march that didn't disclose that stuck with facing regulator criticism for its ...\nWhich may face the latest stature a leap of faith for you it sounds now they telling smart speaker that's designed to make video calling easier if I just called portal have the camera can automatically\nKeep users and focus half a move around a room transfer privacy concerns to license can't record video and then Mike in camera can be turned off a tree and mental Bloomberg Radio\nMagic pills potions quick fixes they don't exist do you want to lose weight and increase energy doctors diet program and doctor Miller have the right combination you'll meet with a doctor\nHe determines your program and your prescriptions and supplies come directly from the office prescription weight loss for at least fifty nine dollars and you're on your way to a new new doctors diet program also offers a ... year zeal mid fillers for smoother younger skin offices in Pensacola Spanish Fort and doesn't make your appointment allow\nIt to five oh for an eye for two thousand right\nFrom the mail into an audiologist hearing setter mobiles studios belt film making the world here better use radio seven ten WINZ em\nI'm rich Dennison hurricane Michael expected to make landfall Wednesday in the Florida Panhandle bringing wins in excess of one hundred miles an hour torrential rain and deadly storm surge\nThat storm surge could be a foot high end even be felt in Tampa Bay states of emergency are in effect for twenty six Florida county\nFox's Evan brown investigators are trying to determine the cause of Saturday's ... upstate New York that left ... dead officials say the limo failed and inspection last month\nThe driver dilemma did not have the appropriate license to operate that'd be a company\nOr the police major Robert ... says they've recovered the limos airbags center which will help determine the vehicle speed and other information Google Plus was shutting down Google parent company alphabet announcing the under the social media platform after discovering a flaw which could have exposed the personal information of up to a half million users\nYour own for Gulf Coast mornings with ... and they'll go and read the news radio status S.

J. last Thursday indicted a seven Russian hackers for hacking A M doping agencies and Westinghouse here in the United states as well as much places in Europe than I was wondering if you had any take on that because\nThree of those guys were named Mueller's indictment so I'm Wondering how it is they could have been doing I don't think there's any doubt there's no\nDoubt at all that the ...\nAnd in the hospital regime of Russia\nBe him being the hostile actor that he is that they are constantly trying to\nYou know create chaos in the United states and they're constantly cite cyberwarfare now has been going on for many many years but I'm going to tell you something that very few people will tell you and that is at some point\nWe've got to take responsibility for the fact that this is happening not only by the Russians by the Chinese and North Korea and the Iranians even some of our so called allies are hacking into stuff\nYou know much intellectual property is stolen it's billions and billions of dollars from America's\nSame ... you know if you look at Julian Assange whose name is probably I guess the most known oh Julian Assange is what it is mid forties somewhere in there okay but he was sixteen years old and the guy hacked into NASA and the D O D\nThat's how long this has been going on\nNow the the fact allegedly by the way\nThe fact that we have not created cyber defenses to prevent all hackers and we have and hire the best people to design the best systems to protect our intellectual property\nYou know at some point we can't blame others at some point we gotta look inward and say ah maybe we're the ones responsible that's what I'm thinking what do you think\nRight I I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with was with us uh\nGive Jay indictment is they were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is the smaller can't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do\nYou know the the the OJ has very detailed information\nUm I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look at over it's pretty it's pretty\nIn depth it's damning and you're right but you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI I don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devon newness warned everybody would have happened in twenty sixteen\nEvery other studies have shown that it has an impact that the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this vulnerability\nIs at some point it becomes our problem in our fault the fact that Hillary you know we we don't have any doubt that foreign uh services hacked into her email system that was parked in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet nobody doubts any of that we'd better take it seriously", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Mobile", "day": "08"}
