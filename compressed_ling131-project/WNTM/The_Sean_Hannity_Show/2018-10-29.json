look if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country\nYou can chronicle it you can watch it they don't see it\nWhich is sad their views and their bias and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they live and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter guy Rodney Bowers by the way he hated President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter not only attacking people of the Jewish faith but\nPresident Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated the fact that President Trump and I think he can make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times you know Trump surrounded by a slur for Jewish people and then the this killer lamenting

said a day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized presidents Obama and Clinton as well as Keith Ellison\nThis is Alan Dershowitz\nThen went on Fox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance President Obama meets with Eric Conn they hit the picture for eight years\nShame on him but now we have the picture President Clinton sits on the same platform with ... shame on him\nKeith Ellison joins with Farrakhan for ... one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic hate just because he's black doesn't give him a pass on anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrakhan as part of the problem not the solution\nThe Pittsburgh master comes just two weeks after Farrakhan you know called Jewish Americans termites and that's mild compared to the\nThe anti Semitism anti Semitism in the past and there's racism as well\nKnow there's there's rarely bashing Trump painter Linder SARS sore after the ... massacre in Pittsburgh where hearing renewed calls to have a national conversation well as long as we don't overlooked some of the obvious suspect\nYou know if you look at some

seven fourteen thousand people make it here\nSo I think that's playing a part I think all the incidence of the mob on the Democratic party side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up a Republican headquarters in Florida we saw the terrible shooting in the Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican Congress but\nYeah I have an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans punched in Minnesota uh there's a lot of anger and a lot of violence out there on the left you see Republicans being run out of restaurants\nUh Pam Bondi run out of a movie theater secretary Nielsen oh Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz and his wife Mitch McConnell Kevin McCarthy's office it with a Boulder busting his office window so there's a lot of left wing violence out there and it's a pretty dangerous time\n[noise] yeah I I think anytime you're dealing with uh this kind of ...

criticism that has been out there for what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nNicotine display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should we saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border of the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nIn Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column yet but what if my read of it is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the mark I mean there's actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president who basically tried to overthrow the constitution and making ... president for life they are in bed with the Venezuelans\nAnd the lay out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the marks so again do great great mystery this is\nWork of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American government look bad and our allies look that\nWell I mean look the America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and I'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of\nAssociating this with which anti immigrant sentiment or is it you know phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic American sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a with a new city does not seem to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also a nation of laws and according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that I really don't want to control the border why is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to getting status if that's the principal\nWell what I'm I'm married and lives I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he says and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence\nThat our military is on the border the military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nUh coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess but nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nBut I agree with the sun shine we don't want to be hurt and also it is undoubtedly true\nThat most of these people are simply on being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S probably been lied to the gun\nI'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross on so they are being caught in the in the middle of this I'm simply used hub of really as human shields on Conan harder on the behalf of\nFolks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country and I've been down to the border Thirteen\nTimes and pushed back all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I've I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall of an end fencing and I can look across the fence and\nOn the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding what looked like what we would describe as a junk yard even\nAnd then on the other side of the fence or you know a million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there it's things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people but\nWe can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way and it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nThere without question of what you've just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who control the border that we are supposed to allow freedom\nAnd the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses\nBecause Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters is a\nCommittee chairwoman and Adam Schiff as a committee chairmen and Gerald ... is a chairman [noise]\nIt just it's a disaster for us eight hundred dying for one Sean are toll free telephone number [noise]\n\nTime saver traffic traveling along I think the five and I think he finally admitting while in all directions\nAny major impact you meet him along I ... you know I found I think the minimum wage would be kind of on the ice and he found through the walls tunnel but other than that we are in the clear\nAnd we are still dealing with us delays will be traveling along math at red lights but east and west down ... to an accent earlier what time favorite traffic I'm calling in the early\n[noise] now doubled un GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen [noise] NBC Fifteen chief meteorologist\nChris done with your Monday weather forecast looking great out there are plenty of sunshine clear skies fifty eight degrees for the overnight low\nMainly sunny again on Tuesday with a ... to and for Halloween on Wednesday scattered clouds a hive eighty three with some showers late night after trick or treat time I'm chief meteorologist Chris done for NBC Fifteen news and this heart radio station\nAnd this is a Bloomberg market minute trade worry hit Wall Street hard hunting wild swings\nThe Dow made a journey of nine hundred points for more than three hundred points higher\nTo dropping about five hundred before finally finishing lower by two hundred forty five\nAnd ask jak dropped one hundred Seventeen the S. and P.

they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in

of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in

it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all and make it sound wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate
