saying during the show these tortured do this outside you're going to get me in trouble\nOr in another tape and unknown person again I'm king corroborate this I'm only telling you what the New York post and and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper if you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia being quiet\nAnyway return to Riyadh on Tuesday ahead of a plan search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe and took a show gays disappearance that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia\nMiddle East English language website holding a Turkish sources saying that there were no attempt to interrogate could show he but that us Saudi hit team came to kill him\nSource told the site that his death took seven minutes forensic physician doctor Salah Mohammed al ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe could show that he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president air go on and the Turkish foreign minister ... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMy palm pay on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts adapt to the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nHop us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged hit team were found to a close ties to the crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman Solomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president say they didn't get any tape but this time\nThey have a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing well I Would assume if that watch exists in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but\nBefore leaving reality Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to pack up and down the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saturday counseling wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later\nJoining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies\nDan hop Fox News contributor thirty year CIA up operations officer a duck the Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a barbaric way that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned uh I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain\nThat this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often an avid wand regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't on American soil that trying to spin\nIt was a foreign national read them and it was a common pay ... you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures\nArab um the ... of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statement for factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years um my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil Bruce Bruce brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nYeah I I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis traveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to lift the day the show he entered and we know he just show again never exited the cause\nUm we do the makeup of those of the Fifteen Saudis for them apparently part of ... one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well\nAllegedly just remembering a show he thought he after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nWhat were the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to hold that they report posts Puerto those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think with a hundred percent right to just fashion secretary state they gather the fact emphasize if they if there's an issue of grave concern to us we'll get that fact with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that once their case if Paul was poisoned back in March\nBritish home secretary said they\nNeeded a void speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here and the last thing I Would just highlight is that Well Secretary if I'm paying with needing and doing its public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or an ... an uncle or probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it's to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's the I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there are very different country but now it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis\nThe Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had Gemini and the region\nAnd their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world um I Know

twenty fifth of July\nThe declaration of a cease fire in Europe was absolutely brilliant Sean because he was able to get pressure on China from Europe he's actively and people are really reporting this priest joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also have these trade issues\nAnd these trade a Greek grievances what China\nAnd so what the president did is rather than fighting a war to directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them\nBut they're applying maximum pressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show also we'll invite me back I think you get to trade deals with China before you get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's a very early in\nThe but let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and tariffs on China China what happened there economy took a thirty five percent dive\nSo that would tell me by now they're probably and I don't know for sure but I'm assuming they're banging on his door begging that they can get those back\nDon't question yeah seven percent hit to the currency thirty five percent it to the stock market\nAnd their their economies grinding down and we know about China is they need to create twenty five million jobs it you're\nJust to break even shot and so uh if if if the locomotion of growth and progress is stalled\nUh it'll be cataclysmic for that political system so I Believe they will be at the table or maybe they don't get it done at the G ... which is at the end of November but I bet you they get it started shortly

had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage you mean it's it's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri their their their local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the

don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive fraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation\nThat has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary scenario for the country\nAnd for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite and ... who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri\nAnd one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding hiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money ... indirect means in order to I guess appeal to moderate through the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking constituency in Missouri\nDemocratic Party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we ... the American people had it when the Democratic party a band in any sense of\nDue process under the law equal application under our laws you know

campaign about already calling about getting the job done Massachusetts I'm feeling I approve this message\nRight that is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now told the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren well she does have to get reelected as senator she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the director of the association of American law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American\nLineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty four\nNative American let me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThen tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics the worse than I mean you know ... it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nOther question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but do you really want to let somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell Geoff Diehl is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nAnd showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm stuck around one when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the models were they on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when it's not tell you something the Boston patrolman association has never endorsed a Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front to back she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm male focused on Massachusetts whatsoever", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Mobile", "day": "17"}
