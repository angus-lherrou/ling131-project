from\nIraq to re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed it confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing this is what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this ... you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but\nYou know remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve Scully so the fact is he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through all the time it was far worse than was reported\nAnd uh people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders if you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen now I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans\nAnd Bernie said he was sick and by the entire you know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him\nAnd I said that and just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and this came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but protecting our elected president is is job one for all of us\nAs Americans he is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said Mr Speaker is you're going to have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms or the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect the president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately has become a pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um there's this idiot\nOn fake news CNN his name I ... what's his name John Adams lawn somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part but when he ... basically blaming me listen to this\nBut Sean Hannity says had a direct language man we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage and big echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the conservative jets yeah which is not like the others\nRight why Robert De Niro well one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blessings in Europe for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things and what she said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes ... or the Robert De Niro is calling the president devil in a devil worshippers effect you know\nA piece of playing the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and the ... to see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ... may sort of\nLeading a lame ing me because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly [noise] stupid he's a hung his dog he's a big he's a con\nArtist a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks she's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has talked how he wants to punch people in the face well\nI'd like to punch him in the face today the world is suffering from the real Donald Trump [noise]\nUm you know if you expose somebody is being absolutely insane you you know it doesn't matter what their politics are managed that we keep America safe\nYou know when I when I go out there and say I'm not going to go ... into this silly ridiculous road of saying well because that guy like Bernie Sanders any shot up Republicans on a ball field the Bernie must support that I said just the opposite is true\nYou know it is beyond reckless and irresponsible for CNN and all of them to ignore the rhetoric of De Niro and Madonna I think an awful lot about blowing up the White House they called the president twenty four seven on that network a liar they've gone\nDeep into the conspiracy theory of Trump Russia collusion with no evidence but ignore such collusion when we do have evidence as it relates to Hillary\nThey fall into the all the Kavanaugh standard but only because he's a Republican or appointed by Republican but they are in love with the Clintons there nobody vets Keith Ellison or Cory Booker it's always hypocrisy [noise]\nYou know you look at the hearing ... who's been warning that horrible things are going to happen if the rhetoric doesn't come down in the meat of the most part CNN and these other networks have been silent when Republicans are confronted everywhere\n[noise]\nLiving enjoy mobile bay developers big

open borders you know she's going to want to raise taxes you know she'll hunted killed jobs she'll put back and regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach president so you've really got just over a week\nTo try to stop pull a few of the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focused on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have a congressional race where the Democrats outspending uh other Republican two million to one million in Virginia ten were Barbara concerts running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point it had\nAll the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million between the Republican or groups in the center of town I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money in the house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats flows he becomes speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by I guess any measure right\nIt's a split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house think of the committees that are going to change\nTo think of I think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the with the with all these investigations et cetera\nGuess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee ... there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go\nThey'll go check his taxes the link all this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us pollsters\nWe get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys in for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election well you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same area you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five and thirty feet I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time projecting a\nVery interesting are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I sit on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare\nAnd I think he is right to say that the Democrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one with a dirty secret\nIt's hot so much from Trump that is a risk the Republicans in the house and Senate much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt the ... one of the weaknesses as it relates to also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty by a separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical she sets the Republicans really need to win and and dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really dug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and had to take power\nAnd the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped a pay for Nineteen Ninety four and September that had we had the generic Republicans up seven and ... it was to house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob\nMichael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour borrowed ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some save the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh Democrats their National Committee two to one\nThe ... that money needs to find its way into the into these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are an spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races where there's digital LEDs a TV\nThe voters by saying oh no I won't vote for Nancy Pelosi meanwhile he's taken a max the nation fourteen thousand directly from her count her dark money superPAC\nSpending millions of dollars trying to buy gas to George Soros icon dire who wants to impeach president\nRosie O'Donnell just at a fundraiser for him in New York City Governor Cuomo Alec Baldwin all of these Hollywood leftists who are all in just trying to attack the president and trying to hurt the upper a region of New York where are our middle class taxpayers are finally say a break free policies or this president\nBut never things to the governor of New York I'll say that and you know the district by the way approves of the way the president's doing his job of according to the latest polls and Trump won the district by a healthy what ten point margin over Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen eleven points to be specific\nAnd it's a district that has benefited ... not because of anything Albany has done I mean there was a recent editorial about how bad upstate New York has become under Cuomo and\nYou know I sat with him and he looked me in the eye and said he's going to open up fracking before the last election he just lied to my face he did the exact opposite right after he was elected\nAnd meanwhile Pennsylvania's economy is growing up because they are now ... securing the prosperity of natural gas that exist in their state and we can be doing the same thing up in your area and we don't do it\nYeah actually we call it the Berlin Wall my district goes into being ten groom county which is on the border\nOf Pennsylvania and you see the stark difference between the southern tier which is why so many jobs this is where IBM was actually founded now we've lost it thanks to the policies of the Democrats in Albany that have just strangled our economy we're\nActually seeing an uptick I'm a small business owner and this district our family business which started in Nineteen forty six on I've been around and just like I've seen I've traveled to fifty or Seventy five businesses\nI have yet
