vote\nChicken for judge cabinet [noise]\n...\nI think one of the more amazing speeches and I I Am now it's actually interesting because as a tomorrow I Begin my twenty third year on the Fox news channel\nAnd my Thirty years on radio that was one of the most thoughtful speeches I think I've ever heard and I'm frankly shocked I'm\nSusan Collins over the years is frustrated the living daylights out of me were opinion so I think what stands out more than\nAnything else is the the since here come the amount of gravity that she gave to her decision and her speech\nAnd the gravity of the moment in an an bringing literally\nA sense of sanity to what has become an absolute she said circus around the country\nAnd systematically went over every single aspect of her decision making process from judge Kavanaugh his judicial temperament\nThe questions that he's specifically answered her passion about\nUh especially that and I disagree with her on on roe v Wade but on the issue of constitutional precedence the role of advice\nAnd consent and the respect that she is showing the constitution the process and the whole process of an role of what it means to give advice and consent\nNow with Susan Collins yes and Jeff Flake saying he is a yes\nOn camera and all that now brings us to well Lisa Murkowski ... know that brings us to fifty or what forty nine fifty one forty nine yeah so that brings us to forty nine\nSo really all comes down to I guess at this point Joe mansion and Lisa Murkowski and Lisa Murkowski appears to be a no and I guess mansion could be the yes\nIs our math right on this who else is outstanding at this point 'cause everybody else I think is on record\nYeah\nNo I've got to believe I think Joe Manchin and by the way I don't think it'll be a surprise he voted yes two\nTwo and a to start the debate the thirty hours final vote a that'll happen mansion well here we go we just broke Manchin is voting yesterday confirmed judge capital the votes so they're poor Steve Danes has the is supposed to walk his daughter down the aisle tomorrow in the middle of this vote\nI don't know how they're going to work that out somebody better Glenn them up a private plane has some kind of get them over there\nUm what I had mired I think the most about this speech\nIs the pressure under which Susan Collins has been\nThere is literally a main going on now and by the way Maine is not exactly one of the most expensive media markets but she talked in the beginning\nAt length about the\nProcess and what this has now become a and talk about it being a a gutter political campaign and millions of dollars and people in groups of people pledging to destroy her and defeat or an upcoming elections et cetera\nAnd hum wow this is pretty amazing I was just an amazing speech\nEight hundred nine four one showing us auto for telephone number Lindsey Graham is going to join us now at the bottom of the hour or I mentioned voting yes flake voting yes and now Susan Collins voting yes which means the votes are there to confirmed judge Kavanaugh\nI Want to remind you if you have any sunspots over the summer I mean and flame patches age ... sunspots

allegations he believed back and forth either I Believe Dr Ford something\nI don't believe facts show that it was a cat and all but I Believe something happening\nOr someone else who did it I think something happened to her I just thought it was no way no way all the words to women who watched this process unfold her doctor for a story\nAnd I haven't I haven't found any way even though they and\nThey had people come for the [noise] I mean just for that so that's the really the herd trauma they want\nAnd I mean my sympathy\nAnd they are her and I said hey\nYou know adequate FBI investigation into happening in our house in four or five years from now on what you see\nIt for the FBI was do you enjoy it I think there's always was done I guess I looked at me and I make\nA decision based on what you see that at a photo investigation but it was for that that is why do people that I was concerned about how they said what they said they did\nI did many places are very often and I'm just the west for hours to do with what you're up for reelection a difficult race are you concerned the baby\nOut and look at this moment\nI Am from at all I Know that Bob the Thursday there's you bother me at all\n[noise] All right that is the um [noise]\nWell that's the party of Nancy Pelosi offend thirty two day she's the speaker of the house screaming in the background and all the protesting that we have seen in the party of Chuck Schumer and and now we know party that is willing to put all\nDue process aside fundamental core values constitutional protections like the presumption of innocence aside\nThat will go along with the guilt by accusation I think one of the more articulate moments was in the beginning of of senator Collins speech\nToday and how she rightly pointed out there was opposition from day one Chuck Schumer was one of them there was nobody that President Trump that was that was going to be nominated that was ever going to pass that they get many Democrats from the get go\nAnd I do believe that that\nJoe Manchin probably a shortage reelection with this decision today but I don't really ... I don't really get the sense after reading his statement in hearing what are you saying and what he's with standing in the halls of the Senate today uh that that really much impact that much at all I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons as well as articulated by\nSenator Collins and what was the most riveting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd now she's systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers um what it means to the whole\nIssue in process of of a presumption\nOf innocence and and how important it is to society or even issues where I disagree with her like for example roe v Wade and precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of of seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction to all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney Greg Jarrett\nFox News legal analyst author of the number one bestseller the Russian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you have the same reaction I did I was I was the ... I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant a week with uncommon eloquence and sound reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a compelling legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important that at the outset\nCollins can damn outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote is concerned and and I I the best part of what she said\nAh was ... many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate they'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations and said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence in fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent duty and she announced her own standard\nFor considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers you know in the civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence\nUh and she said it wasn't there\nThere were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including your closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said so under penalty of perjury so she presented that\nThat was very suddenly the most impressive but I mean her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness\nWhich I said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserve a a serious response from the Republicans and often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did leak this today grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold you are now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion and Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday\nOr that the\nThat judge Kavanaugh has the votes to be confirmed to the United States Supreme court\nBut certainly looks that way I'd like to think that senator Collins each\nBrought some dignity back to the process is certainly did for the moment when she was speaking she you know as a student of Senator Bill calling from Maine I was very close friend of mine with whom I disagreed on some issues but it was ... thinks in that same vein\nYou're absolutely right what she said was critically important again it emphasized the language of article ... section two accredited she'll have the power with the advice and content\nWhat's been lost in all of this also critically important that she emphasized the presumption of innocence you know have some legal scholars and commentators during the course of this debate wall of a sudden this and one of the presumption of innocence doesn't really apply this isn't a trial it's not a trial based\nConcept in American law that kind of fundamental American principle that's the way we go about our business we don't assume based on allegations man or woman has built up a career is guilty it was important for that um I worry still I have to say about where we go from here because we have here by you\n\nTime saver traffic\nLook

country\nAnd um I I I I'm frankly we never run an entire commercial free our unless it's really important news and we did that for you to our beloved audience because it was something that I wanted everybody to hear\nThis is a moment in history what has happened in the last Eighteen days can't continue to happen in this country\nYou cannot bludgeon people\nWithout any corroborating evidence the way judge Kavanaugh and his family have been bludgeoned you can have political differences and I've had my share with senator Collins over the years\nWhat really realize today is I don't know her well she doesn't do a lot of television she's not somebody of interviewed a lot like the most impressive thing that I took away from this\nIs the seriousness the intellect the the systematic\nShe walked every American through hard decision making process\nAnd frankly it was flawless\nIt was spectacular nothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money then it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly following her conscience on this issue and\nShe had it ... it was obvious she missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail of this process\nDid all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative and and\nNow I guess the left is about as unhinged they'd been I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate

blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years I'm a tomorrow I start my twenty third year in the Fox news channel\nShe is a fiscal conservative she

seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know the Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you got the extreme
