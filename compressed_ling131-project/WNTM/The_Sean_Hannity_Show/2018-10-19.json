and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus\nOf you know you're exposing the Democrats and what's your agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to\nBe to expose Nancy Pelosi once she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about

have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona with both of those ... above it from my perspective is the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for

even bigger than the one inside\nWell look okay yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get the sixty three million Trump voters motivated jets are
