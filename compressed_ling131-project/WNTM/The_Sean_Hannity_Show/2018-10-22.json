radio seven friends telling you when GM oatmeal and I urge radio station nine point nine W ... three mobile\nThat appears to be part of the strategy for a caravan of migrants that started in Central America now an estimated seven thousand heading for the U.S border where they are willing to take their chances despite us efforts to stem the flow\nAh apparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this\nHave you on a prediction it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida is a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his races by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd in Iran dissent this about it a great debate last night and he is now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nGillum as we use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views he's trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for\nWe saw that with British citizen the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida we've got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason bred as it is out there trying to convince the people to Tennessee that he is something that he's not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nIs just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony\nShe goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets looks so Harvey tour with with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states\nThe party that wants to eliminate ice ... open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we pay the criminal justice cost\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the health care costs we\nPay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process that we have sovereignty and we're borders and they deserve to be respected and what does it say about\nThe people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront at the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry\nI mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texans alone\nVictims of crimes\nSome very serious including murder and then it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing him a throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nIt's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory or coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visits a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty Eighteen election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house and the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean it's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox a poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about ... the blue wave and sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill\nUrging caution about those predictions mid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom Perez was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi whereas her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black um ... Marshall mixed Martha ... Sally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly a problem for the Republican Braun in\nThe state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race and that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong well Mike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this and add to all of this this was an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is at an all time high but you know I'm Crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nI mean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and then we had four thousand people around there a moment at a huge crowd in Houston as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got to force the hypocrisy so we've got the cabin on your shoe you got the caravan coming you got more mobs over the weekend confronting and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country\nGot now two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans were more safety and security a stronger president versus eight years of failure so we have a choice in this election\nThe data and misery to buy that look to two hundred two hundred video follow us on Facebook\n\n\n\nWe have a report out that the caravan is now grown according to the Washington Times fourteen thousand illegal immigrants marching towards our southern border the president just\nSpoke out about it with a play some of what he said at the bottom of this half hour out if those reports are all accurate it's a whole lot bigger than previously reported and growing\nAnd what you have is members of the caravan chanting guess we could as they're making their way through Mexico all day to day I've been defied the will of one country vowing to test the spine of another\nMexican police who failed to stop them at the country's border with Guatemala now service escorts that appears for the care of on as they know battling north\nAs members clear that they have no intention of staying in Mexico Leah ... for the U.S new estimates cited by L. universal which is a Mexican newspapers say the Caribbean now has fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others do wait\nOh that would put them in the category of illegal immigrants not an asylum seekers because you're seeking asylum you have to seek it in the country that you first appearance\nThey appear confident that this confrontation is gonna come down to this is there's this extraordinarily dangerous for the country here but I Am telling you\nPolitically the American people fundamental is white Kavanaugh matter they believe in the in the core values that this country was built on a due process and presumption of innocence they also believe that we are a nation of laws otherwise why have the\nAnd Americans didn't think it really don't like the idea that people think they can march right across the border into our country we don't know who they are we don't know where they came from in some cases most cases we don't know what their intentions are\nNow the president has already said we're going to begin cutting off substantially or substantially reducing foreign aid or Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nAnd he says every time you see people illegally coming are attempting to come into the country blame the Democrats for not giving us the boats to change our pathetic laws and that would mean building the wall that he wanted to build that we can get done\nOr the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back we have a lot to get to more than ... much more straight ahead\n[noise] so [noise]\nNow doubled un GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen [noise]\nIt's gonna be a clearing Comstock to the ... year high today Seventy seven degrees we I've only had an east when at about five

new estimates cited by L. universal a Mexican newspapers as the caravan is now grown to fourteen thousand people many of them are already in Mexico while others wage\nThat's part of the story the president now has alerted the military to be on standby for possible deployment orders to the U.S southern border\nI mean this is in every word you know I remember I think Michelle mountain wrote a book years ago called invasion\nThe American people I Know the Democrats they're thinking this is their moment this is good for them I don't I don't see how any of this is good for the\nDaily Caller has a piece out saying that the majority of people in the care of on not ... that are headed to the borders are not as is being reported families including women and children\nAbout instead they're quoting multiple reports that this new way above\nA caravan or is this comprised quote a mostly young men who appear able bodied and could easily fend for themselves back in their home countries video footage posted by Telemundo news shows hundreds of the migrants\nYou know behind a chain link fence said the Mexico Guatemala borders some of the men scaling the fence others violently shaking it causing the barrier to break apart and as the gap in the fence white men of course a lot of the men from that moment we're able to cross into Mexico\nAnd this is now a confrontation that is coming to the southern border of the usa I've been down to this border what twelve Thirteen so why why ever many times\nI have seen it it's wide open what are we gonna what's gonna happen and we have to send our troops to the border what kind of crisis is going to be precipitated because Mexico won't do their job and now according to some reports is even helping the caravan ... make their way to our southern border\nPresident has also said that Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they're not doing the job stopping people from leaving their country and coming to the U.S illegally and he's now begun the process\nCutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that we give to them\nBut the president also right in that every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming into the country you can blame the Democrats\n... they're the ones that love these policies they're the ones that have been saying they want to eliminate ice they're the ones that say they won't open borders they're the ones that keep saying they want amnesty they're the ones that like sanctuary states sanctuary cities and sanctuary policies\nThat allow even criminal aliens to come into this country illegally\nWe have one case this was a out there well you know it just I mean it's basically a national emergency if you look at it\nYou have a Spanish language reporter who spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan and a report friday said that they met people from Bangor ... dash\nThat are joining the people from Guatemala into Mexico Univision corresponded Francisco Santa Ana reported that the bridge separating ... while the mullah in Mexico the British has been packed with thousands of migrants demanding access to Mexico this was going back to friday the ultimate goal crossing into the U.S illegally\nShe writes the Bangladeshis were detained and an immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after their detention the borders and Central America not as strong as the U.S which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily\nOr said Anna on Univision they cross from Costa Rica way to go through Guatemala and eventually make it in our country\nAnd yesterday they were traveling through Guatemala we noticed people from El Salvador even people from Bangladesh can you imagine what they had to do to get here they infiltrated themselves in the caravan and tried to cross with the crowd that would have been benefitted them greatly\n[noise] um so you've got the care of and continuing their march now a couple of other things that you've got to understand here and there is a political thing\nHaving been to the border everywhere from the Rio Grande the San Diego\nHelicopter horseback boats all terrain vehicles you foot I've been out there I've seen even gang members arrested right in front of me while I was there so an entire family from El Salvador arrested right in front of me\nA bit of the drug warehouses which I played it many times I've seen the tunnels that of that had been dug\nThis is not just I mean this is the biggest rushed we've had but on top of it and maybe they think the Gavin Newsom is gonna win and they can all go to the sanctuary state of California and there'll be safe and get the free health care the Gavin Newsom is promising every Californian legal not legal wherever you come from free health care free free free\n\nAt it and I got along very well very late in pain and I said don't worry about it as all the time and then it became very then and then it was over\nWe got along the way I like what do you remember he was the last one I really I mean I wasn't related\nTo actually held a rally to get the latest I edited and then it got back to re\nRe for regulations you\nKnow he's really driven out of you look at what's happening is you're referring to the fight they want to know aren't buying that\nAll right that's the president I'm speaking with reporters these are about to board marine one headed to a joint sub base so Andrews ... head on out to Texas in Houston but the big rally tonight what even Bernie Sanders says Democrats should stop writing off\nHalf of America so now we've got lawlessness accepted no presumption of innocence Kevin uno due process capital\nLawless this on our borders lawlessness\nWhich sanctuary cities and sanctuary states you know I sat through that briefing with Rick Perry weapon to see this weekend I liked very much or energy secretary and six hundred and forty two thousand crimes committed against Texans and just a seven year period alone\nAnd it's also about angry mobs that we saw all weekend long I mean the most vicious by all horrible nobody in the Democratic party speaking out none of them are joining the president and saying

and Trump versus white the court was\nNow we know what they're real position is but what are they going to advise the president to do is fourteen thousand people now are heading towards that border\nNot a good position for anybody to be in the president is committed not only to cutting off aid to the countries that are allowing this to happen which you should do but also he's put our military I noticed that he may have to send them down\nAnd that people are not going to be walking across our border elite illegally this is what's happening every day just singing in one larger

is going head to head with a liberal Democrat\nGeorge got for this newly drawn district and\nPerry won the last three terms in Congress by no fewer than twenty five percentage points but now because of uh Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision\nSo they decided read do you draw that state's congressional map as a district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking\nThat's a hand you're dealt and or any way a congressman Scott Perry is with us She's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting midnight\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out there were ... they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it or to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you kind of highlighted some of the things er during the course the big thing they're doing which are not just doing it to be you know in talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nUh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it\nAnd that this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a show on you know they're the ones that screwed up our healthcare system and and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a twenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan to keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now they're blaming us permit set it up um we try to repeal it of course you know what happened with John became put what thumbs down but you know Sean when we fought the original Freedom Caucus in particular for that original bill\nOut of a you know the ... the replacement for Obamacare because if you remember we're going to vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it the original bill that deal with preexisting conditions among other things\nThe Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew you know wouldn't talk to the president talked or leadership\nThat said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right in the buildup we finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we broke healthcare\nWell that's all they tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is will Republicans didn't support pre existing conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific\nBattle and in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate is gone and I mean it all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where are you going to have the young\nAnd healthy literally buying plans that they don't need or want be enforced by law to habits or penalized if they don't get it financially and then literally redistribute that money to the ...

book uh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans had won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so ... what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the late in the rape arising a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American than you or me into the vapors Asian big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process in the meat you movement\nLet's take this guy that did very well credentialed judge oh he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out in much higher percentages and people predicted in so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we're very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blamed the Democrats were not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be a sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so they don't get a you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot of left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's\nResponse all you want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters under the laws I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nI've everybody saw ... ... ... well could there anthropology so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago by every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created\nThe number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ten percent of the society shutting the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know kept reliving wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us all through the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get hit and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he was at the end of the day he resonates with these people\nLook I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's about politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave a a a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better than your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started died you know\nSean short list that I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration and America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that\nCan do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did drop parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the white policy shift of white free market based motivating market incentive policies\nOf because what we both know is it you cannot just ties or through a political system created equal outcome never happens black markets crop up\nAnd then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated by their Cuba or Venezuela like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she does all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction\nAlso in Pensacola got selling on ... east bound between Pensacola boulevard in scenic with time they were trying to think I'm Lisa ...\n[noise] now WN GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen [noise]\nNBC Fifteen chief\nMeteorologist Chris done with your Monday weather forecasts you've probably noticed the skies are already starting to cloud up will hold any rain off until Tuesday\nFifty seven for the ... percent chance of passing shower on Tuesday I've only Seventy one a break on Wednesday high Seventy six and then stormy weather moves and on Thursday with a high of just Seventy I'm chief meteorologist Chris done for NBC Fifteen news and this I heart radio station\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute most us equity spell with financial in commodities shares pacing the law says the Dow dropped one hundred twenty six points the S. and P. last eleven the NASDAQ gain Nineteen\nDespite a slump in stocks and gains in the dollar few economists are concerned right now that brought financial conditions will strangled a second longest economic expansion on record\nCorporate earnings reports will get a lot of attention tomorrow three am McDonald's horizon caterpillar United Technologies among the companies that will open their books to investors\nThe market for meat alternatives is growing so fast even the maker of spam is interested in the head of ...
