Bush didn't care about black people because of the way he handled Hurricane Katrina\nNow the left hates him because he is embracing the president and saying to black people take a look at this guy substantively rather than automatically being always on the side of the Democrats I spoke with the president and a couple of weeks ago and suggested he talked to kind of a gym round the football great and Tiger Woods the great\nSo that's why it hurt don't told Trump to bring these guys and I should've known I should've known Geraldo\nTold Trump to get Kanye West in there and Joe Brown and tiger tiger hasn't been yet but you know that Geraldo did bring up a or something I forgot it was\nKanye West to told George W.

W Wendy I'm ... and I always radio station Ninety nine point nine W. I. max the H. G. three mobile\nWe are with you I mean the Brady Feinstein is that message from President Trump to every state hit by hurricane Michael the storm now blamed for at least Thirteen deaths in four states from Florida to Virginia it's damage assessments continue Fox's Evan brand live in Miami\nI think that's that should be basic and fundamental for\nAnybody the issue of incivility is now back in the forefront even more I mean it shouldn't surprise anybody\nUm and by the way what is really happening what a play ... James O'Keefe is going to join us and the Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away and the polls a little bit there him and his campaign and his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people at tendency\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play a few later in the program today but I mean it is it is mind numbing\nPeople have zero truth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all way do we get to the tape on sentiment today\nOr you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester is they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're gonna do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington\nBut then when they get there and here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump they're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that sort of first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time\nBecause that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and the answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're gonna get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes well that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever to never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs are never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what ... what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here and creating factories manufacturing centers here and when they tell them well you know it's costing us\nYou know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation\nOther presidents wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that has created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that he challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully now aided thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody is that all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what ... was saying and I'm like why do we think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example\nWhen the president ... commuted the sentence of Alice marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug offense\nA grandmother apparently she'd running a horrible economic ... is it like ... there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system\nAnd we spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her right into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen\nAnd then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's in prison that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that may be a bit given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York while I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred three or four hundred Bernie Carey was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets they're going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary of our our human\nOur human family in talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before our eyes\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better and then he's talking about bringing jobs making with things in America and creating jobs in America you know the ... they shouldn't be about conservative liberal\nRepublican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed and we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAnd why as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be African American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness\nIt's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious vial thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow don't read flat folks aren't that since he's praying tiny west and the race on draft flowers and sudden Kanye because he's ... he's an attention more like the president have all of a sudden now that the the model folks person he's he's the token negro of as the Trump administration's\nThis was an embarrassment ... mother is rolling over in her grave\nAnd you had there man has clearly not OK and a president who is willing to look boy that\n[noise]\nRight as we're all alone Sean Hannity show eight hundred dying for one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program so much happening\nYou know I just wonder I think there's something we can factor in here there's actually two things that I that are just known what the president know the president is going to be in Ohio tonight president spend now traveling the country you know I Love the fact that you know probably political people around the president of\nTelling him while you may not want to get involved in this of Republicans lose they're going to blame you blah blah blah\nThat that's just not how he rose to ... if we if you fight hard and you give something you're all and you don't win at least you can sit in the mirror and say you did everything you could do because there's a lot at stake\nIt's not going to be the end of the world of the Democrats where it's just going to make every thing harder and more divisive and more difficult and it's going to waste our time and slow or progress I ... that's really the truth\nAnd it's important that we keep the momentum are you're better off than you or two years ago are you a safer more secure is the economy better off\nOn every measure we know the answer to it\nBut watching Democrats unhinged is pretty amazing right we've got tapes on yes read as soon as running in ah Tennessee and cinema in Arizona will play those next [noise]\n\nWe don't think about how much we use our heads in day to day functions or realize just how complex and delicate

I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you notice the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done a regulation the businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole having a hearing in how unfair it was and you can see we had to pull this ... this week where I'm\nMcCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down write and write and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have pulled their because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want jobs\nAnd what Gary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nDo you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your poetry to raise taxes take what you got to take away the jobs take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfavorable among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women\nThat the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country to these house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats\nThey're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that if she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house\nBut I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups I think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because\nAs somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice they won't fund a border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average has gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they're really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of a New York\nI have noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo does anyone want me in the state did you know that I Know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat their problem is not me and that's it themselves or are they streaming service or write to\nMe was so high that they are closer to the conservatives say noticed that it's not as\nSimple no one has tons within a wife oh no one can\nA um right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone um salt but there's no place for me in the state\nOf New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything and you love and vote for one's me out of town\nSo am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president\nI think that you run in Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity office it like to run for it I think my friend John and I can\nSee the ... well you disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still hampered you're working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join ... New York that's our biggest export is is the people and taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it does hold an ad on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a this former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\nRent I heard it oh yeah yes I don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash but but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we are basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back into the place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be gotten governed have control of their own healthcare\nBut but if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\nIs it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you do oh\nI Want democratic candidate at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal races absolutely going to should go period\nStyle absolutely and and does point about in previous times are have been on the radio is you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time what should have been on the edge should be better stop Nancy Pelosi from getting\nI think it's got to be harder than that I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years if you
