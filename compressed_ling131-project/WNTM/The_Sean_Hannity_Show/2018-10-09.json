I. max the H. G. three mobile\nEverything you get is predictable Democratic Party one oh one smears slander ... blood joining whoever they don't like and don't agree with it's nothing new it is there one and only play book\nAnd we have chronicled this now for years on this program\nBut the stakes couldn't be higher for weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house\nAnd committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman\nJerrold Nadler of New York I born Jew over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better or they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare short of that what else do they stand for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency has only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years\nYou have also on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases\nBut are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was two years ago is America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago\nIs the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts well at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation is kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because it hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced the bolt built today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall we now have record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years the last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world that won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea the sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from many selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd then twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler ones endless\nInvestigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people what are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts are working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nYou know while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood joining of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted subpoenaed emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with the cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in may\nOf twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing and then all of a sudden they interview her Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and they exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James ...\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney remember the company ... that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait\nWhich is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that they went out and hire the former and my six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dusty a when push came to shove and an inter August ... Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI who is now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or or stepped aside\nAnyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's done in terms of what it reveals since that directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI official sworn testimony so in other words they lied under oath and Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael\nYesterday with Rod Rosenstein apparently that's a meeting on air force one\nStatement says they got along you know fine but\nNo Rod Rosenstein is up to his eyeballs and everything involving those things [noise]\n[noise]\nWant to make your home and more comfortable place but don't think

both felt it was time for a change residents along the Gulf Coast are preparing for hurricane Michael to make landfall tomorrow along the Florida Panhandle Florida governor Rick Scott says the time to prepare is running out\nWorking Michael is a monster storm and therefore caskets keeps getting more dangerous we're now just hours away from seeing impacts\nIn addition to high winds Michael's expected to dump torrential rains bring deadly storm surge and spin off tornadoes evacuation orders issued for several counties in advance of the storm's arrival\nThese Fox News [noise]\nLeaders of the left farming guinea to go back and say I want no part\nUse radio seven ten WINZ em\n[noise]\n\nRaining swab bomb at us by this is Sean Hannity show\nTwenty five 'til the top of the hour scary hurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit landed a category three\nA and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be just in Fort Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weatherman of the Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and being I'm being told is the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nWhy I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record in Panama City\nOr that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage it there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane and the golf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area\nNow the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins and mobile I don't think this was a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain\nBut once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in the Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThe weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast\nThis one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a place that strong category where he perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was on with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean look the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much what is the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern when Florence was coming into powder in the western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twenty believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October of ...\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the tycoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely I said well what that has to do with us well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComic to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to ... ... or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and what we got the last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get them ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto we hit it off to the east over there with or\nThis is going right in between and instead of coming western North West setting it's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nIn a lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is going to be another three to six locally ten inches of rain\nComing Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go\nSee to the south the New England no problem in the north east from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't it the ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe gusto hurricane force along the outer banks in forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves up it's going to accelerate through there\nOut by people like Larry Kudlow called it the hottest economy in the world well there's no doubt it's for the proof is in the ...\nUm you know it was an interesting piece by my buddies you Hua Trump may be outside of our norms but he is the feeding for all of us and I and I just read a little bit of the article I didn't finish it yet\nBut I think what he's saying there's a point that I've been making as well except in a different way and that is that if you look at any criticism of Donald Trump it's all stylistic stuff\nHome style they don't like that is combative they don't like that he breaks dishes they don't like\nThat he fights they don't like that he is at times not polite um they don't like that he's a disruptor ... Khan a clash they've got their image of how a president needs to behave in an act in what they should say and that they shouldn't be tweeting and this and that\nThe problem with that is to be get rid of that side of Donald Trump you get rid of what we elected the disruption as good breaking dishes in a swamp\nLike DC is ending up a good thing for the American people that's why the jobs that are being created the millions of them the manufacturing that's coming back the business environment is never been better the security that we are now obtaining the better trade deals that we are\nNow also locking down it's all good for the American people\nI don't know why people you know there are different people different styles and life like lenders very combative and drops the F bomb a lot on

a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last you know really aged ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility and at the same day in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your aid you give concierge care at all I could pick up a bone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of the tree and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states in every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be about more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was a physician or on health policy because doctors never seem to be at the table whenever we're having a conversation about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in ... the table to have this conversation personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice of health are pushing me was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create ...\n... ... ... ... points with Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country was coming down medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about health insurance we're using it for all\nAnd you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots wondering insuring it using insurance drives up the cost of the product\nSo an MRI cash price for us is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her commercial insurance you know we go through all the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or\nI'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical I'm an ... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone who I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nThat real close enough I was about testifying us some help committee on the ...\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock to gather news and who is now offering free health care\nFor everybody whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California if you get sick um\nBut there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance in that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nA for every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my\nDoctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack a accident or cancer how much we one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars per year or a month a month or so\nAnd the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send him an originality destroying more money at the problem has never fixed it\nThe what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get Mets cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a bit you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us is how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well mama care made that illegal or so from that ... just brought by ... with access these major medical plan called ... short\nPolitical ... and some would argue that these are actually ... they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses or Seventy five dollars a month\nOr two but but what it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model\nIt already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\n... everybody's welcome everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... will not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the truth is it's so much more simple than that\nAt a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the caution and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those because they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWhat they're gonna have to move out of New York because they don't make it easy but they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the a few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that costs that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nA I applaud you guys for what you're\nDoing and the fact that you've been able to duplicate those model around the country speaks volumes about what your real mission is and that is saving
