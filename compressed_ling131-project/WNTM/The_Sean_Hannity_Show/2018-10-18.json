certainly the America will just were left because they're losing the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I think we're going to keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans but all they have left there's this kind of a new street violence\nA witch and the end I think turns people off because it's it's it's it's also a little scary because ... ... when he was shot um\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is it's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watched the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of videotapes\nAbout running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nFirst began working on it in uh Ninety two\nWhen did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taking over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I it everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as a pension its intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think look I I think he is the fourth oh cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity\nAnd there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society with so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of what is now\nIf you go back to Goldwater of fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and and they and I think that just further isolate some\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they won in ... they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and that's partly because I tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be\nA magic moment in American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind our cabin all and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination to childish behavior by\nUS Senators in Senate meetings I think all of that came together to really re galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks because it makes clear\nThe argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the\nFeinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance\nAnd remember these three thousand people I I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people will probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala highly four thousand people now grown too amid a spike among and us border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall and that just is it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump's manhood I mean\nYou know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams a who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says the show's on draw any distinction between the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor of California\nWho openly says he wants to have government run health care\nAnd make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean the Democratic party is becoming the party of

was overturned nine zero in the U.S Supreme Court the same guy the sent for Merrill executives to jail for a year\nAnd that got turned over by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals that sound complicated it really isn't it is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in the history of the country\nAnd I haven't even mentioned\nThe abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence that we give these people supposedly to protect us joining us now a civil\nLiberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown in Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and you know Carter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back from places like Russia\nOr you would willingly ... feet deep briefed at and and tell them everything you know to help your country out so uh I guess if you were really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled and they needed to Hillary Clinton's on verified phony Russian ... to do it\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the ... the courts I Would think you'd be indicted right now if you were as bad as they say\nJohn it just it it just kept getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigations\nAbout things that may have happened a couple of days or or he was within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that is you know people I've been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of\nGood government that Coakley ah hopefully the uh the car just starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and that I think we're getting into that as you've been a a all over in terms of your reporting so\nSo bring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roles called oversight their job their their check we have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances part of their oversight is when they are investigating the investigators\nThey been obstructed every step of the way\nRequest document requests we have found instance after instance where they cite national security is a reason for not turning something over only to be turn out to be having nothing to do with national security only an embarrassment to them now we see in in just the last two weeks\nOh Rod Rosenstein who gives an extensive interview to the wall Street Journal here's enough time to testify under oath\nLens Simpson is pleading the fifth now your doesn't want to appear and testify under oath James Baker is testifying today and James Baker and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe in one other person all saying Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire\nTo go after the president of the United states\nOr if you are representing our friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits in the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a strong basis for sticking not only information but also damages and relief and he is now by the way of course conducting some indication going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong\nThings have gone both with the ... the court and otherwise and governments you hit the probably\nThe most important point going on here Congress's role in providing oversight um you know God willing congressmen Munoz is going to return after this election his work and good let's work\nHas been vital Congress can no longer bluff though anymore they've got to tell the testimony of these folks I think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements\nThat these folks make the American public demands since ...\nAnd they deserve nothing less and transparency and by the way these aren't simple mistake that have gone on you know we've talked about this\nNinety nine page report on Pfizer court a abuses that uh and it said director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts
