Greenland has had near record snow fall and the reason why the north Atlantic is changing it's getting colder again we're going back to the cold\nPeriods of the Atlantic multi decadal oscillation like we were in the eighties and nineties early nineties and that's a natural cyclical process so\nAsk two years if you look at the charts you can see Greenland has had well above normal still fall and near record snowfall so Greenland she apparently she's on aware of this because two or three years ago of course Greenland wasn't that way so right about Antarctica\nSo so Antarctica is up near normal they will record breaking record breaking the high about five six years ago then they came down below in their back your normal now let me let me say this\nPresident answered the question perfectly here's why\nUp until now\nClimate change first of all everyone believes the climate changes so that her question is based on a false premise that he doesn't believe the climate change the climate is

Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\nThey should make him show up and do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth and it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope Jason you're talking to your former French and telling them to get them a get hit in to the Congress to take that said and\nI don't care if they're not going to\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got is the ... you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later\nYou don't say oh mine's you didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene and he said Pina and then you say you can't make it went state and you make it Thursday that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... of warrants the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but\nYou know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get them to pay his but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard Michael ... Mr liar and said\nOr all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states\nWhat's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has it in court issuing subpoenas court we now know that the FBI or am I stick and that you do you\nConduct electronic surveillance of Americans did he say that on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information was fat conversations George Papadopoulos were intercepted and in the course of the interest of compensation\nThey found out that that was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information because by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testified that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all um and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something there there's no there are there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that the CIA information has leaked out to the media creating the impression\nThat in fact there was Russia Trump collusion but they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be good begin\nI is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and remember the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before a Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being the most candid about what was going on there but\nEach of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition\nUh transcribe under oath or before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know after you have questions when you do this and I've been in these they go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans and you can really get in\n\nTime saver traffic and all the only got an accident on weight Ninety and lark would dry that's near forest hill elementary school and also\nIn the Pensacola area we've got an accent on ... just west of one fan also watch for work going on on the traffic controls that they are in place on water street between government street and Beauregard street the time they were trying to think I'm Lisa ...\n[noise] now doubled un GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen\nFrom NBC Fifteen I'm chief meteorologist Chris done it feels like summertime trying to make a comeback out there\nBut we do have a cool down coming up this week in the forecast not tonight though Seventy three for the muggy overnight low thirty percent chance of some showers out there\nThat increases to forty percent chance on Tuesday with a high before and then the rain clears out but we hold on to the clouds on Wednesday morning low sixty eight with a hive eighty back up to eighty again on Thursday I'm chief meteorologist Chris done for NBC Fifteen news and this I heart radio station\nThis was a Bloomberg market minute stocks were lower at the end of a volatile Monday session the Dow Jones industrial ... eighty nine points or a third of a percent twenty five thousand two fifty the NASDAQ close sixty six points or nine tenths percent lower the S. and P. five hundred last sixteen points or six ten percent\nBranch shooting of northwestern mutual wealth management Nazi fed rate hikes or trade tensions bigger drag on the domestic ... economy affects\nLeash on inflation is much longer this time and they will continue to tighten with a velvet touch trade concerns have moved from a global concern to one that has focused on China\n... says geo political concerns usually end up being short term blip on the path to hire equity markets\nGeneral Electric has come up with the initial designed for what could be the first commercial supersonic aircraft engine in decades it uses a twin shaft twin fan designed it could lead to the development of private planes and jet liners that fly faster than the speed of sound ...
