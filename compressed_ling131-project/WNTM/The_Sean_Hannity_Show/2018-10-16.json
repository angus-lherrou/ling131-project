Frank and fortunately in around it by the crazy people I'm just wondering what are we going to let you take that California I got one gathering in that dark I mean I was living in San Francisco when he became a San Francisco and he gives you ruin that city\nListen I you have a great Republican candidates out there John Cox he's a great businessman his his problem is simple math and sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City this even happened in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman\nUm and and and all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans are elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that Cox could wind now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign and say free health care\nFor everybody in the world it's a sign you're basically our governor saying illegal or legal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average California is that is taxed at Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction\nWhat people want to experiment with is that you know ... what am I I'm not there to tell people\nYet and I agree with you and they had on counted on it with the family thinking gotta get out of California can't afford to pay taxes on this [noise]\nYeah I mean it's unbelievable look I why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey and Illinois to states like Florida Texas in the Carolinas wire Californians all going in Texas\nYou know what what uh Democrats on what they're hoping for that California demographic shift so that the people that ruin California and left might do the same thing a Texas\nUnbelievable which is what the beta O'Rourke has been all about from the beginning\nAnyway you know good luck um I Would say John Cox would be a great start and that was done

on same happened to governor governor Bredesen and Tennessee\nHave Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble uh we now see hell are very important seed in Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll only state I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response next to hurricanes I remember that that have hit there in the last year where we're Scott has really shown if you're a member of Sean the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey uh that's for Hurricane Sandy hit and then President Obama had the advantage of\nActing like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney has basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama because member Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking to thousands while he was the campaign manager\nA for Mr Obama at that time\nAnd he said yesterday is and why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with our DNA\nNow he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say and many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the headlines\nAround her and she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that one one thousand done twenty fourth she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type I mean but it is but her she literally personally change herself\nTo minority status when U. Penn and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nDry it and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate\nThis is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or is it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage\nA CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ... ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren really reveals proof of Native American\nAncestry again what proof at this so backfired on her ... nation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies in twenty Twenty one one thousand twenty fourth just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah I Know they're going to see who the Democrats settle on ... and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress those are grew born by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they\nKeep telling me not to say it I think keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project ... tape with Claire McCaskill in our own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration at all you know a sanctuary attacks packs a punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it\nAnd Democrats and strategies to prepare the memo said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo a more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their ... to ... Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed and and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be and I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP above four percent unemployment below\nFour percent rights or something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible when you're Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missile over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the\nPillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with Kavanaugh as well even that CNN did a\nSegment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that\n... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into this election because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think back I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive a that's easy to remember and it's\nA it was good enough right who was it will make America great\nAgain or keep America great again the Trump could run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump some trouble like you did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ...
