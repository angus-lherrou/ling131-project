W Wendy I'm ... and I are radio station Ninety nine point nine W ... three immobile\nThe FBI maybe finish her ... Fox News sources telling punch the FBI supplemental report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nFor Kavanaugh he'll go vote for capital St probably with Heidi Heitkamp I'm Joe Donnelly already said no who knows if he changes his mind but he's on record saying he's not going to do it [noise]\nUm so we'll see and you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case about what is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in\nThe case of any allegation\nYou know what I Want to get into what this all means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but\nWhat we do know now is that obviously all the people that said we believe her\nLong before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all\nPresumption of innocence that is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump\nNominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about your rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country\nAnd I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page or tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and\nTherefore he got as well as from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance\nOf covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done with the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people that have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already that they in the case of\nProfessor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know that we learned about this Ramirez and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they\nCalled dozens of people they found out this Ramirez was actually no she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest and on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been an e braided rather quickly it\nThat that particular event and the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe serial ... almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties but as he said almost on a weekend basis what happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them\nAnd then of course she gave for names to NBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person to back up or story one of the names was dead and another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior how does that become news\nAnd yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well\nWell they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um while he was in ... no I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happened that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation that somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official\nA teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug in kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that yeah but the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident from Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nPolice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone that's in a Supreme Court [noise]\nWhy we need and has the ins and because there are a lot of allegations as far as really are about how he behaves finance truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that\nWe got a hold of at the Fox news channel and ex boyfriend of professor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case\nAnyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath to last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the Ford\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman I had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claimed afford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on\nSeemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment ... look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day\nShe said there were four people\nThat could corroborate her story none of them\nCan corroborate her story most don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen so at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent\nYou don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions and if they did\nThen okay that would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but I mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and\nI've got to believe and assume that they're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed she just said it last week before the Senate Judiciary committee [noise] um you know it's just I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get in\nSo what this all means because what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all that matters Lindsey Graham is saying Clintons sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I\nI think the the Republicans held the\nActually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness a topic like this deserves and we'll see what happens in the next couple of days and who's going to vote which

all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really to the Democrats that would have considered voting for judge Kavanaugh will only do it I Believe in fact there's enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but\nIt comes down to Susan Collins it comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England as we get most of the week and his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency a judge Kavanaugh one of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smeared and treated with a ... vicious personal in fact all those things I think I mean\nThe Susan Collins who what was going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday and he'll be on the court but the deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn about who these people are\nHow they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope to that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you what thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president for the first time in forty years you ran on something and you got the entire\nCaucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America\nAnd that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days of which you did accomplish that task and Republican for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota\nAnd he's laying out the case that if you want results you have a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats\nAnd he's been laying up and and you see it and the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening and I think the president has set the stage now to pit and spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next\nWe've got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence said and I said America's coming back you know what I'm saying we're back yet because we're not\nWe still have a lot of work to them but we're coming back\nAnd now you have a chance for the president's leadership and I think this election ought to be about which kind of America do you want us to be we want us to keep coming back\nKeep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children ... Thirteen gangs from fentanyl and promote people that are you prepared to be part of a team to one's constitutional judges not radicals\nI think if we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun on election night as we had in two thousand seven\nWhy I mean I hear optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you I think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house\nI think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans could defeat Joe Donnelly in Indiana a U.S a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill in Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona\nI think Dean Heller can hold the same no matter but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power there\nSome course now that's probably have campaigns\nWe've got we've got thirty five days a year to go out and when and and I remember it and you remember 'cause your air two thousand six two weeks out I Do an interview with Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so then you are going to lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I said to her we have to alternative universes\nIn my universe I Believe the average American is so disgusted with fish resistance oriented left wing radical Islam I think the average person knows when when you hear Democrats say they're for Medicare for all their time to destroy Medicare they're talking about destroying your health insurance\nThey're talking about bankrupting the country\nAnd I think that we just have to go out and wager campaigning I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen\nAnd I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hardworking decent American his disgusted\nWhat they just saw happened to Kevin all his is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to do a you know for example\nA government run health care means tax paid abortion well they're very few places in America where there's a majority for your tax dollars paying for abortions and I think we have to be fair to tell the truth play into it in a direct way and if we do that we're going to have a very good election night\nI got to take a quick break from our nation's capital more with Newt Gingrich on the other side later on Joe diGenova Victoria Toensing and much more as we continue from the swamp from the sewer it's Sean Hannity show\nBy the way if you like me and you hate weak weak coffee I hate it or those big liberal corporate corporate coffee brands they're the worst uh and you want the best coffee you've ever had and roast to order delivered to your door simple\nSaver traffic\nGot an accident in that can't tune minutes in the turn lean on us twenty nine and ... lake we're also in Molina just north of ... the ... bridge is now open to traffic\nAnd driving is slowing down on Ninety westbound between sixty five and ... in ... bill with time saver traffic I'm only ...\n[noise] now doubled you when GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen obey their I'm Jake done from NBC Fifteen with your forecast Ninety degrees this afternoon the record high is Ninety two\nIt'll be a close call partly cloudy skies and only a slim chance of a thunderstorm clear and more comfortable tonight we're down to Seventy one mostly sunny on Thursday at near record high of Ninety One also and record high territory on friday before the cooler weekend with a few thunder storms\nI meet ... just Jake done for this I heart radio station\n\nThis was a Bloomberg market Bennett stocks advanced in mid week trading the key index was closed well off their session hives the Dow Jones industrial is rose fifty four points or to ... percent\nTo twenty six thousand eight twenty eight that's a record high the NASDAQ closed twenty five points higher or three times per cent gain the gas and the five hundred to two points or tenth of a percent\nJonathan gala both Credit Suisse told Bloomberg stool bullish on American equities\nBathroom you Assad is just more innovative earnings growth is better their moral bus so yeah I think it's simple I Would say with us now\n... says the U.S economy is out performing all other major economies\nShares of JC penny finished higher after the retailer named a new CEO Joe sold tower joins penny in two weeks\nThe pace of growth in the services sector picked up last month surprising economists supply managers non manufacturing index rose three points almost had to record high Jeff ...

them or their friends who are number of these parties to remember how I think everybody in the county remembers that and we have we haven't heard from friends and so I'm asking is are there people alive today I I have a yeah I had a way out us parties there are people that know about that\nPart of this morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweating it another of the French she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two and had to turn back\nIf you cannot get a single person given to you named given to you that would corroborate this\nStory to actually corroborate the story and you don't have it and you see a pattern of of backtracking and shifting and changing not not in significant facts but the most significant facts\nRemember the story was about almost on a weekend basis and I've been to ten of these parties myself where young girls were drugged and boys lined up the hall you ... so they could gang rape them\nWell I'm Me gave out red solo cups and I saw him at a party I don't know if he did anything to the punch\nUm this is so reckless irresponsible NBC how they would ever dare run this is beyond any comprehension I have now if they had come from a nation if they had witnesses\nIf there wasn't a changing shifting\nStory if there wasn't traumatic backtracking they might then have some legitimate reason to air this but because\nThey want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really really pathetic\nIt's not fair there are at the un and I'll tell you the other thing\nThere are victims people I Know in my life\nOf sexual abuse I Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole book about evil people that would ever drug rape\nOr girl are evil these people are predators they need to get off our streets but you gotta have some cooperation to these things\nAnd it just comes out of Seventeen Days ago\nJust on the eve of the confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh and if you go issue by issue case by case you know it it comes down to do we believe in the presumption of innocence due process and simple common sense or do we believe in guilt by accusations\nWhich included career politicians other actors\nAnd one adult film star\nThat's your look back at

come at it would love every week we'll give you a new cat unless someone is sick or someone's kid if they don't get our schedules together\nYeah it's kinda like herding cats anyway just broadcast pod

they can do that with them\nLimbaugh alarm for news radio WN GM ... radio you can\nWe can when you were in the war in the swamp the sewer Kaylee ...\nAnd ... with us or what I don't understand there's a well I Know there are consequences ... because\nI Know Richard ... lawyer at the time a really good guy by the name of Lin wood uh he got after a lot of media companies I Know the Duke lacrosse kids oh they went after a lot of people after that smear job\nUh I Know what's happening to UBA rape case I guess that's that's following through every one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence\nAnd they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes I guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh ugly for the same reason we use the public figure uh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road\nThis is what they do this with who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job wanting a ... year\nUh I mean if if we're going to have a serious conversation about breaking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you're having come the Democratic members of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss\nUh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they're going to regret long term because every\nDemocrat I I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes and then years\nAnd then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there's no we won the election what's the difference and the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've given\nEvery possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote now the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and where it's just not going to vote\nAnd write it comes down to the three I mean Mitch McConnell I had been a real warrior and pushing forward look though at a hearing graphically not all that and pick up the Democrats\nYou're exactly right it would have been taking a week ago if we would have had like ... or ... or China I think he here that we might not ... ... and I think that not because I had any faith and Democrats\nUp because they have political calculation didn't mind you had Joe Manchin looking at it gate or thirty percent margin\nPeople are getting out one seat ... confirmed by thirty margin that people have North Dakota once the Kavanaugh confirmed it would be political suicide\nOr high camp or ... or ... not vote for the nominee don't ever get out of principle because their humor lapdog but they might be out of their own political okay well that's exactly right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but I think I don't think they go that way a less\nCollins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and and flake or or Murkowski inflate once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man\nThat would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah it I mean [laughter] don't\nReal does wrong principle is man that bans on yet I'll use\nIt as a man who wrote a book and the king Barry Goldwater's conscious of the conservative and it you know if he is then now we're in a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff delusion

California She's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh committing some lurid sex acts is there no corn left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that if in fact she you know she made the statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations um\nYou know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this\nI Know that we have now we examined every single case in every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nYeah well I think um what has to happen who's truly sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs\nNeeds to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitting false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that Mitt sweat and they'd\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate issue for her story there is no substantial issues permits Ramirez story and I just want to say something that I Know\nAre probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied them like her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for\nLawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I I got I got to tell you I don't think they told or if you remember that moment\nWhen professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise then remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist the resistor as a lawyer this is separate hats never catch by the way who said well Paula\nJones only spent ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton and it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of Al Franken\nBut I ... I saw a genuine shocking surprise and she goes well ... I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional rules\nI I'm a I'm a very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy with except that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases\nHere's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety now why what's her story not include her going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it\nShe had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe because we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators\nThere are people that do murder and rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case we know that and and this is why I think to the Republicans\nCredit they took these allegations and charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats they just they just now have pushed this so far\nInto it it ... into any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nI I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react I Would assume was probably ... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence\nTo corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is non existent Jonathan happened that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned them music up so nobody could hear her\nAnd then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what you think these guys just turn the music ups and no one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down so many flaws in what she said\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with\nVictoria Toensing Joe diGenova next and then your
