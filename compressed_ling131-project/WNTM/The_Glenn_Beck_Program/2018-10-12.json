hold onto and the future\nThat they were all very close and had this wonderful experience together before it's such a tragedy and their family\nSo and it's just so many different stories like you know that a husbands and wives reconnecting um we actually got a letter from someone they had to struggle to having a baby for four years and came on an operation reconnect trip and then\nOh don't tell me [laughter] [laughter] it's just the gift of time to create a bigger\nImpact I think that we even can be getting to know personally I'm sure it's just it makes it all worthwhile so we it's we love together it's really fun\n[laughter] and and this is a way you know we we tell 'em veterans thank you for your service but it's also like to thank families for their service because you're all in it together or not\nMy job is easy I'm not going to speak for every service member out there but I work we work seven days a week twelve hour shifts we'd go to work we our food that's given to us and we just do our job but for Mali unknown particular I mean I had one phone call there's water pouring out of the house you know what you what do I do well if I was there\nI could help but she's got to figure out the solution she's got to figure out\nHow to solve the problem with me seven thousand miles away um again my job as a service member to me is very easy we're very well trained very well equipped we just go do our job\nThe unexpected the unknowns and taking on the things that are usually done in the team concept and and one spouse and it could be male or female um show during those burdens and those things that they're not familiar with but it's it is challenging\nOkay let's tell people like and how they can get involved with operation reconnect if they want to register for\nA vacation with operation reconnect they've got to\nGo where ... veterans to register for a program called operation reconnect dot org basically anybody that wants any information whether it's volunteering your time are registering as a veteran donating your property all of that can be done on line that operation reconnect dot org\nOr to see the local events that were participating in and I said local we moved on events all across the country from the mall of America in Minnesota to the Missouri state fair\nTo the motels of the floor bam a a all all most of the current information on events is going to be located on our Facebook page\nAnd you have an event at the floor bam on veterans' day\nA very big event yes\nOkay so you've got this this jeep that you're a getting donations toward then people can have a chance to win a jeep\nYes we're giving away fully customize to thousands Seventeen jeep wrangler it's against fully customize from the wheels to the lift to the paying job I was actually painted right here in Mobile Alabama all done by hand [noise] um\n[noise] we're giving it away to one lucky person who chooses to make a donation and get a raffle ticket a twenty dollar donation will get you one ticket a hundred dollar donation will get you six tickets and one hundred percent of those proceeds stay with operation reconnect and this is our second year doing this so if you wanted to see the results from last year's give away\nUm that video is on our website operation reconnect dot org\nAnd the winter actually owned a property in pretty key and donated his property last year so not only did he win a jeep but the organization or get another property donations to serve even more families and that just proves that we're all connected and\nUm anything else and go ahead of me\nWell we've got a just a few minutes left is there anything that you you want to get we got three minutes left in the shows or something we haven't touched on yet that you want to bring up\nI think that a wonderful way also people can get involved as we do have volunteer opportunities which you can go to operation we connect dot org and sign up to be a volunteer and we can send

right now uh we we are developing a strategic plan for to those Nineteen two thousand twenty and beyond\nI Can't can't let the cat out of the bag yeah OK but stay tuned but one thing I Would like to

it matters last night uh\nAnd I and I asked the group\nIt was a\nTurning point for the Democratic party the leadership I think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they denied God\nThree times in their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm and you are you are seeing\nA in you're seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of ...\nPeople don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but there we are repeating the Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\nProgressive as him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because\nIt is it it's looked at the clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them on the table at the moment is\nOr a Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you ride but I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative and so there's a lot of a discerning people in our ... that had decided they don't want to be the next Ralph Reed clown show on cable news basically they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nBut and it's because they don't understand that progressive isn't isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I say this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on ... you know great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is a this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth dosing Darwinism it has its own in ... where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts and said when the government removes the God the government will become the God and that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from a leftist when you trigger them on their on their ...\nIs the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk

they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan because your life will be in danger\nAnd that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor you're you're attacking their idol this is not near political disagreement this isn't even just fundamental existential philosophical disagreement this religious fervor you're dealing with the lucid sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that a dissertation dialing the understood about ten\nPercent [laughter] they couldn't short races and\nTranslate that into human language\nAnd I I I think we see that with global warming with a with their reaction to abortion with loose Robie weighed thing that means absolutely everything they worship at the altar of these things it it really is a religious fervor\nYou know that you see with them and and this is kind of the the point of the ... ... ... is\nThis is ... this is\nYeah they if they don't necessarily know they don't know it but that doesn't change the fact that what they're doing it was the worship of the environment and the sacrifice of your children [laughter] he wanted your children to be sacrificed on an idle\nYou would have permits skew is sex at a celebration of bail you could do anything in the woods and the girls in the groves and then when you got pregnant he would call you back and they would slaughter the newborn baby right I I mean it is exactly the worship of bail\nNothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period whom himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows his history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in the New Testament world and Romans one\nWhere he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff that would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that

without the ... in support of the media\nYes I Believe the media here at eight percent directors\nHey let me just tell you a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the ss which came out on Tuesday and in that promotion I'm basically saying that\nWe in America are seeing a rise of hate and evil\nAnd I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that I tied it in\nWas that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees and they said that they send them out on missions and one of those missions was Senator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him\nBecause she was a victim of something and he was an idiot for not the siding with her\nWho's the woman the woman is an activist and the Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct and media matters within a half an hour says I compared the woman to the third Reich\nOkay\nNow that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never\nHaving pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are part of that eight percent\nLook what happened and Kanye West my favorite guy of all time [laughter]\nOkay yeah so Kanye West who I ... I I didn't really made him I was in an elevator with him at Madison Square garden ... short pants on I mean it was brooding\nRight okay so he goes on Saturday Night live which has staked out territory to destroy Donald Trump because it's good for Saturday Night lives ratings\nThat's why they do it All right so ... goes gets invited to go anywhere is to make America great again hat and and no one

hat and and ... with the president or whatever they\nDid mhm okay now why does anyone chair\n[laughter] thank you for sale CNN on his whole day yeah I Know he's talking about what do you want to buy\nKanye West right now Taylor Swift she comes out against Trump All right and she's telling everybody in Tennessee to get them so Taylor Swift and Kanye West do I care what they think about geopolitics in any regard back the answer is no I don't\nAnd no one else does either this is a tremendous example of political\nBut what I miss that tiny tiny it was just going against the PC so he
