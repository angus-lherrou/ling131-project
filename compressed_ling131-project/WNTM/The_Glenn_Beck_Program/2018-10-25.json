that's not a very good return I think it's less than three percent\nThe reason is not what he earned his what he got to keep tells new fees when we dug into the to the contract and showed him the fees they were pay was is has been paying was three point one eight percent per year\nWell writer than his return that now that the return was after that was the ... oh okay All right so so he was making over six percent a year on average\nBut they were taking out three percent each year before they granted to to his account [noise]\nWe don't deal a variable annuities oh wait you know if you're looking at\nA Fort we deal with four one K. is our race in different investing Virginia push to get a great portfolios we show people exactly what the fees are that she charges\nOn a managed portfolio we show people what if any fees on the fixed index annuities that we use or they fixed annuities and for the most part\nThey don't have any fees so if you've got a bucket let's say of a million dollars in an hour a day\nAnd you come to us and it's all in a a this particular individual had Ninety seven percent of his money in the market at risk very wow I didn't realize he didn't realize how aggressive team was being\nWe took were taking the million dollars and we're splitting into five different buckets using some fixed index annuities using some fixed annuities earning\nMore than what is variable annuities earning right now none of those things have any phase and then you put together a portfolio where the fees are a lot less than the bases paying right now to exist me advisor but we've taken were taking about four hundred thousand or forty percent of the money\nAnd that's going to be invested with no fees at all\nSo now he's only paying fees on about ... percent his money and the fees paying on that sixty percent is less\nThan uh the percentage that he was being charged on the phone with me and so it's not what you earn is what you keep and looking into the digging into phase is so important but most people just like you said most people don't know what to look for where is it on my statement or how do I know\nPattern and more ... another question is how do I know if this is fair or not ...\nUp because you may see the fee and see that it's big and think well that standard everybody's\n... yes now that's not the case it's every all the structures are different in different you know depending on where you are and where are you invest in what you're invested in\nA so it's very important said now we you know it's the second opinion Wes where we give you bring us all your stuff we ask you a bunch of questions we analyze where you are now\nIn a second meeting we show you where you are now more times than not people didn't realize wow I didn't know\nThat's when

to have a U.S\nCertain amount of money to come in to talk to you or will you help people even even if somebody just has a simple four one K. yeah very very much so we do that you know you'll hear ads on the radio about\nSome investment guy that says you know oh I'll never put money in June and they have nose bleed fees that just like the example to issue summer I really do have nose bleed had these\nAre that's why we don't do a but when you ... been in order to have that guy is your advisor you have to have a half million dollars okay half million dollar minimum with that they can a person who's not here immobile\nA we have clients with us two years ago gave us two thousand dollars and that's all we've got you know it's grown but that's it\nBut uh that person recommended somebody else

moved to twelve she'd be getting sick from the company and I showed them if you do that and we just earned four percent in that four oh one K. how much more money she will have\nA five or six years

the same mailed the Democrats Fox is Tanya Jay powers lobby or New York city\nOkay Dave the two packages that were addressed a former vice president Joe Biden have been intercepted that was originally thought to be just one one of those was found at a male facility in Newcastle Delaware the other in Wilmington in addition another one was found this morning at the Tribeca Film production office in lower Manhattan address to actor Robert De Niro\nTalented staff of comedy writers during their jerks farmers Michael Moore's ... you know he was funny for Columbus is\nAt the time but he's not really funny enough to be a stand up comedian as we as a side has basically stand up comedy show a Michael Moore and Trump land which cannot twenty sixteen break during the weeks before the election is hoping sway the electric ...\nWhen you when you say ... and when you say like we saw um I don't think you're yet you should be careful with the use of the week 'cause I don't think I don't think I could find two people maybe you and I don't know who else in his audience might have seen that\nYeah I think they're dressed like a million bucks I mean his all his most flopped in the past few years and that's the worse and worse Sacco did okay but\nTwelve years ago as movie about a health insurance and what she claimed that the Cuban healthcare system was better than us and this was a it is sort of insane rats are no longer that rare you can find them everywhere and basically I think they use audience that used to go to movies I remember\nOr Columbine get a lot of\nYoung people in their twenties or real excited about that movie\nUh they've forgotten about it maybe they moved on to Jimmy Kimmel on a Daily Show and all these other alternative forms of comedy and uh you know Michael Moore is ... is really funny enough to be a comic\nAnd and okay so so you are you saying that it's just that he's not funny or that a is there anything to be said\nFor uh the fact that ah this this kind of stuff uh\nYou know you can get the actual people you get the people in office now saying these crazy things so he's not he's not the rebel anymore it's\nJust it's not you know he was revolutionary and we're a rebels you know alliance and we all got to you know we're all in it together will now you've got Nancy Pelosi saying all the same stuff that he was saying\nRight there is there a scarcity value to what he does anymore everyone's doing it uh there's a kind of pathetic my one at the end of Sarah nine eleven nine where he does its Hitler montage and strength say Trump is like Hitler and it's like interest into playing the speech the Trump and Hillary and that's what everyone's been saying Trump is like Hitler last for about three years he was\nHe was like is the last one to this Trump is that what party it's so boring it's been done to death\nThat is amazing observation of ... where the culture has gone because we have at that point it was a big deal when someone came out and essentially advocated for socialism in America\nI mean ... and we talked about what we're Bernie Sanders and twenty Thirteen coming out with Medicare for all he got no co sponsors on that bill and twenty Thirteen now every major democratic candidate is pitching for that pause and they're not just talking about socially you know there's a there's a problem in America where\nWe look at Canada and say that to socialize nation does not\nThat's a capitalist nation that has socialized medicine and has other thing all sorts of welfare state yeah I had you know as welfare state that's not a socialist nation and they're now on the left pointing that out that we're calling for an end of capitalism\nI mean we've gone we've gone further than just saying yeah were you know we're socialist like Canadians no no they're now saying no we want an end to capitalism and they're still getting elected\nWas\nIn a in a leader of the parade for a while but now he's kind of ... in ... it's ... it's kind of gotten ahead of her closest movie a capitalism a love story with the communist uh at them you see the Soviet Nashville handsome and and I that kind of thing is it's not that special anymore as the whole Democratic Party has gone so far left\nSo what does that say to you does that say as I say we're\nIn a lot more trouble than people might think\nWhat does it say to you that this isn't shocking at all\nI think the Democratic party is not doing themselves any favor by by moving way to the west about Obama at the time was seems like\nGehring Lee far west but that's that's about as far west as they really should care to go they really should stay out of all this transgender stuff they should really stay out of this open borders stuff they should stay away from a abolish ice should stay away from the Medicare for all of all the stuff that they're doing is not helping them at the polls and\nThe Republican Party as a result is is in its strongest position since the Nineteen twenties\nWhich is astounding which is astounding for the opposition that it is had 'em and the the the flaws or that it is that is well it's it's amazing that it is this strong a and it's only because I think of the Democrats moving so far left\nI agree ... thank you so much Kyle Smith a critic at large for National Review\n... ... ...\nSo [noise]\nI'm listening to President Trump got another one of these [noise] [noise]\nAh you know rallies and he's talking\nAnd I'm\n... and and I'm I'm hearing the reporter this morning talk about it and how out of touch he is and I thought to myself you know one of us is deeply deeply mistaken\nBecause he was saying you know this is this is this election is about Cabot all this election is about the caravan this election is about um uh shutting people up\nThis election is about tax cuts\nAnd I thought yeah that's that's really what this is about that's what this is about\nAnd they of course are saying you know those are just dog whistles set for if if you think that the caravan is not something you should worry about what's wrong with you if you're not worried about the economy and the effects of the budget and tax cuts\nUh what's wrong with you you just don't see it or are you is your philosophy\nSill upside down from traditional American uh economics in philosophies\nThat we are now on the other side of the fence promote move from one another and I I think when it comes to the politicians that's what it is they are on the other side of the fence and they just don't think this way anymore\nDonald Trump has said

program sir how are you\nDoing great thank you very much good\nSo you um [noise] uh you wrote to me last night and I'm not smart enough to understand it uh you said there is a ... there is a procedure that you're pushing for 'em to hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was that the Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they took a department of homeland security and the department of state chasing the workout room it\nWith Mexico a whereby a\nMexico would require people who enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from any of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people were coming from\nWith the intent of claiming asylum that they would have to claim asylum in Mexico rather than in the United states would be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada and a rule imposed buddy\nYou refugees are arriving in Eu countries from Syria in other words\nWhen people were fleeing a a a country that dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them where some particular reason so that they have an asylum claim\nThey ought to apply for asylum and the first country they reach that could be potentially save your that should be Mexico\nIsn't that normally what happens I mean I thought that when you wanted asylum I thought I personally I think the United states government should be running ads do not come to America with your family\nBecause you will be turned away if you were in danger come to the closest to us embassy and apply for asylum\nI mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\nYeah it should be more like that and that's not really how it works and that ... in order to these people end up applying for asylum with Mexico they're sort of going for the long ball ill Mary pass and tried to\nMake it all the way to the United states but this jury is itself dangerous this journey that so I'm\nRight with opportunities for people to be exploited\nUh it it can ... actually dangerous journey for many people especially for children and for young women or many of\nWhom are sexually assaulted during the ... and a lot of the people claiming asylum turn out not to be able to make the case that they're even eligible for asylum but once\nThey're in the United states it makes it much more difficult to get them back and we think that the asylum application that they're coming by land for Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as they enter Mexico\nI talked to a great guy but the other day and he said that he thought\nHe was working on something with the UN to put some sort of a camp there in Mexico for these refugees have you heard anything about that\nI have not but I\nDon't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a a lot of potential magnet I agree for bringing people here um if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the journey from somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become more of a problem\nAgain you you you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is the crisis with the refugees themselves\nHaving to make this long dangerous journey and then knowing that when they get\nHere the odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event at just creates a whole lot of headaches for them in the process\nSo Mike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras

Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's all wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know at this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a left wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that that I asked when the president has actually called for violence\n\nNow you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\nCalling the media fake news\nIs not calling for violence I don't like it but that's not calling for violence encouraging your electric to the electorate to harass people in their homes their restaurants places of business Maxine Waters\nIsn't that the equivalent of calling for violence declaring the end of civility or Clinton I mean I did go on\nBut we all know the left narrative and you heard it again yesterday and it will continue until the midterms\nIs\nIs over or that's complete bull crap it will continue and continue and continue many of our friends in the left leaning mainstream media were just utterly shocked that this kind of attack occurred\nOne person or remarked how they'd never seen anything like this directed at just one side of the spectrum first of all that would force one\nTo deny that the latest pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep\nIn your memory bank you might need a hypnotists or therapists to bring this memory back at it so long ago\nOh wait a minute no it was just a couple of weeks ago the rice and letters just sent\nTo the White House James Mattis FBI Director Christopher Wray CIA director Gina Haspel air force secretary Heather Wilson chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson did you just happen\nTo forget all about all of those or should I take you back to the baseball diamond which was no way but I mean how old were you in twenty Seventeen\nHe barely remember was I walking at the time I don't even know\nAnd as far as the identity of Wylie coyote for those of you in the mainstream media it's really best not to speculate\nIf you don't know you should say you don't know here's who I think this is\nI don't know there's no evidence on anything\nEverything is speculation and if I Would say already ... versus ... person trying to Iran for every body up what would that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters\nAnd blaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts you do something like that and something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold credibility but you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility\nTo be able to gain it\nWell\nFor the second day in a row Jason ... who is with us it it it he is a\nA former [noise] I'm a former

I think I was reading the tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder and um I I was looking at it and I was like\nNo not really\nI mean it's a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb\nThe shrapnel is what's dangerous than a pipe bomb the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need [laughter] [laughter] right [noise] um but there's another ingredient they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it\nUm they said they did detect some of that in there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything's spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing a\nLower or somebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want it to work\nRight it had no I mean if you're looking at this thing there is you know and I've also spent some time and some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to they\nHave screening services whether it's the secret service\nPrivate security or like places like CNN on media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would no well I was no chance just gets to the the coverage
