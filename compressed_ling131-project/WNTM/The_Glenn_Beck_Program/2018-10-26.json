Henry today are expert is Dr Thomas Bender board certified dermatologist with advanced ... skin care center a forefront dermatology clinic\nNot diminished these patients in Daphne in ... and that he's mobile\nOffice in Providence Park near Providence hospital you won't find out more about Dr bender learn about these services that Dr bender provides you can go to his website advanced germ clinic dot com that said Vance to germ clinic dot com\nDr better in the last segment of the program we talked about the re cervix laser let's talk about the X. L. V. laser what do you use that for\nWe're trying to remove excessive vessels if you have those little vessels on your nose for example on your cheeks someone who's suffering would diffuse redness just ... maybe you can't see individual veins that are increasing\nSize but he had this excess redness we can go after that as well and so patients with rose Asia you know of course you know benefit from this laser you know and the thing is\nWe have lasers and they'll try to the laser companies are trying to say oh you you know ... you know you're right you can treat dark spots your IP our country you know sun damage well we have an idea and the thing that the NFL does well with his son damage is brown spots that's what it does really well with\nBut if you're trying to push the envelope and use the ideology to all these other conditions the patients are gonna get near as good results as if you had the right laser which the ex Sylvia specifically designed to remove rent\nThat's what it's for and this is this is against something I never thought this is something I didn't know that was possible or people with with veins in the face especially the fact that you've got something like this that can treat them about maybe a lot of people that don't even know what can be done\nWhen he was asked me why me were of course constantly educating patience and when patients come into the office and they see the information that we have for them now oh you mean you can actually help me with my response you know my doctor a couple of years ago told me there's really nothing to do for that well\nYou know they may not have had a good tool for this certainly may not be something good topic ally to remove a vessel on your nose but now we have a laser that can do that\nAnd you are you you you have used that on me or and it was a a great procedure in that there was zero down time at all at least for me I Know everybody's different but zero down time for me with that and uh as you would you explain to kind of like being pot with a rubber band\nYeah and uh I mean you know without laser worst case scenario maybe you can have a little bit of bruising that's rare but it's possible maybe a little bit of swelling um but in general it's just not a big deal is likely slow most patients down now we don't want patients to plan on going you know getting overheated the day of their procedure on the beat liar that procedure et cetera but um\nEverybody's different but uh but it's it's a great procedure with the ... will be and you can also use that for various things\nWell smaller veins on the legs we can certainly use you know it has to wavelengths and so for veins on the legs we can use that and we also have\nThe ability to inject veins and legs now they're large rare costs nice we generally or for to another provider outside of our uh organization to a typically those veins and see if they can do it in the vascular laser procedure\nSo a few more lasers to ask about that you use at advanced or mythology and skin care center and that's the luminous laser for hair removal uh that's another thing that a lot of people may not realize that they can ... you can use a laser forward that\nAre typically what patients want ... hair on the back that type of thing [noise]\nWell I'm In you know for men a lot of times it's here on the back that would they won't remove than we yeah of course\nNot only is the limits laser probably one of the best here with all eyes on the market but they also have the largest spot size so we don't have really large area like a man's back I mean last thing you want to do is lay there for an hour plus ... someone you know she eats away at your back with a laser right so you know get that done a little bit quicker maybe twenty five minutes\nOr is better for all of us so that's one thing that's very good at you know of course we'll have ladies that come in maybe there are some excess of dark hair the upper lip of their ... and we can remove that for them you know maybe they have some or you know here in the bikini area they want remove we certainly do that and then of course patience legs I mean you know both men and women\nTo or want to hear off their legs so you know\nNow is the is the head yes and I've I've had friends of mine that were professional weightlifters wanted the hair off of their legs and if they know\nOr I don't think this was available they when they were in their body building competitions but if they knew they would have been here\nI swimmers of course uh they they ah do that kind of thing but like this is a non judgment zone so wherever they want their hair and they were more than happy to do and\nSo when somebody has luminous laser hair removal or is it similar to the experience I had with ... and then it's not that they really are nothing short of of a rubber band [noise]\nThat's exactly uh like it is as far as discount for it and of course we're moving in the winter months I was a great time to get two or three treatments under their belt generally a treatment every couple of months depending on the area where trading and um\nYou know it's going to take a series to get it gone and then we tell patience look you're gonna need one treatment a year going for to keep it clear after you get the series done\nOkay that was my next question is the hair removal permanent you say about once a year correct [noise] uh let's talk about the mirror Dr laser explain how you use that [noise]\nWell you know there's a lot of patients out there suffer from excessive underarm sweating [noise]\nAnd this is actually I think ... just as big a deal whether it's a male or female I mean you know when you're [noise]\nOr doing something even if it does it make you that anxious and they're just profusely sweating and they're ruining their nice dress shirts are ruining their nice blouses makes them feel more on easy and uncomfortable and so this is a treatment where we can actually bring a patient in usually with one treatment\nBasically decrease their sweating by six to eight percent for life as long as they're over about twenty five years old and they're glands are completely developed so in in rare cases I think when I say rare over the last four or five years we've all that to patients who want to have a second treatment\nAnd even those patients said that about sixty percent improvement\nThis is another thing that a lot of people may not have known was available to them and and we don't need that sweat right\nNow I mean those those nines or about one percent of your total sweat glands so it's not going to affect your ability to thermal regulate\nAt all [noise] now is there any downtime or recovery time from mirror drive\nMe some swelling for several days afterwards but patients generally can we don't want to do any kind of excessive exercising or anything like that was in the first couple of days but after that they're fine they might sound a little bit of swelling a little bit of numbness on the in her arm but generally are patients have very few if any side effects for that procedure\nYou've been listening to a board certified dermatologist Dr Thomas spender

severed just below the elbow when it was in shock he handed the soldiers his own arm after applying a tourniquet and told the soldier he needed to follow him as he got another soldier out that they wasn't able to walk the man and looked at his own separate an army and his hand and repeatedly told the medic\nThat that helped him that his arm was fine and this was in his arm sometimes we just don't know how to deal with things\nFor two solid weeks I lie to myself my daughter was fine and this didn't happen didn't happen to her it didn't happen to us and I broke down in tears\nFinally able to process what had fallen my now seven year old daughter\nMy wife forgave me for spending those two weeks it wasn't until months after\nThat we would figure out who had done this terrible thing all they want it to do after she told me about this was find is that the sky and cut off the offending appendages\n\nAs it turned out it was a twelve year old boy he was in my Sunday school class for ten

height of my hatred I downloaded your book addicted to outrage on audible\n\nWho's the last couple of chapters and I heard you speak\nThat I I realize that my outrage was justified but it was also toxic and it would become a force to be used to destroy me\nI needed to forgive this boy because we are required to forgive all men\nI forgave him in my heart\nAnd as I did I felt the burden of my

me\nHow we're responsible I had been to not realize she is probably dealing with it as well\nThere are things that we don't want to think about\n\nThat are truly frightening and I think when we look at our country when we look and we really realize\nWhy do we really stand to lose it's not our job is not our money it's the unsinkable\nIt's something that doesn't happen to us and happens to other countries but it doesn't happen to us\n\nAnd it's so scares us that we avoided and we talk about other things\n\nBut that's just as dangerous as the outrage and justice talks toxic\n\n\nIf you said

end and the American people uh see me as a fighter\nThey see me as a person who strikes back when attacks so while I'm going to do that so then you have to say okay well who started the fracas who

and everything else came\nLater when it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win see what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could do anything you want to have a chance he was he was like\nEntertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear that's how the press saw him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed\nAnd it I I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does\nOkay so then it was destroy him\nDestroy ... that that would be orders that came down from the editors with the New York times not in those words but it was very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nAnd all that will Facebook I mean they're on their ... their own video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump\nCounter what does he do he doesn't have surrogates\nI mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it\nA very ... and sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice\nWhat if he doesn't do it they are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah and the liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that\nBut he has a growing I Believe growing
