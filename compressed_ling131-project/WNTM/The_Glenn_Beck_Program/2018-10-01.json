commerce secretary Wilbur Ross says\nThis is fundamental reform and now there is no more now after\nSo tell me and let's go ahead\nAnd you look states specifically we don't want one city running the entire state and this is common in many areas right New York's\nNew state is so very we have mountains is as good as Colorado and have online as good as the Midwest we have lakes we have rivers we have we have Niagara Falls we have New York city the biggest city in the entire nation we have it all in my state\nHow in the world can that be run by one city it's impossible I Want to allow county has to be counties and regions to be regions and people to meet people and it's totally fine the issue becomes\nWhy do I want to enforce my will upon you I Want you to be as conservative or liberal as you want to be people tease me and say Larry you're from queens how do you know you know what's right for upstate\nI don't that's the point and guess what you don't know what's right for me in Queens either\nWere even how would you be you you let me be me and we can all be free to gather\nWhat a ton of work\nIt has words that's our original idea we just haven't done it in a long time so so Larry tell me\nYour day one you're governor of New York what do you do\nThere are several things I have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote 'cause it's a five way race in New York state and we are plurality state not a majority states we don't go ... for the one percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I can actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen ... percent ... percent of the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be forward when this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nIt does not just the Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is this something that the ... yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even coming in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it would make better Democrats and better Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government they will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant it's just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties that's supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that will libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government now they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] they will be a massive a massive\nCulture shock within within the uh the state and within the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nI don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years that's my assumption and I'm fine with that but I have to focus on several things one a complete re board of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay\nFor things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government I next that the credit culture of transparency because the problem with all governments now is they're enforcing the kings will\nSo they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and I don't want the government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution or what does that I don't know\nI Know I Know it's I'm not sure it's an old dusty on day to document\nEgo yes anyway I think we sort of the way a while ago yeah [laughter] but yeah that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families who met her individual businesses but individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value\nTo each community we don't do that well in New York state it all we have things called regional economic economic development of corporations\nWhich Albany which is the capital and decides where the money is spent and opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county how buttons that the county's can start to budget to zero\nSo they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concepts one\nInstead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and put a little ring spending here's one idea that does both of those we have a bridge is right now in New York state and one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial Britain named after our well family\nThat's embarrassing how 'bout instead that Britain is named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights of the bridge we retain the ads that they've gotten a business gotten that giving my ass at up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all these companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year on marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that she was on the weekends\nI got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person ... uh sixteen million person metro area\nAnd a hundred thousand cars pass in every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nOr less at Texas hang on just a Texas New York's ... Scott Texas you should listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but he has the best part now we have them do what maintenance again we own it so we still we still inspect it so damaging to our responsibility\nThere is through parrot right they begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending and spending it so guess what laugh the fix bridges but she's right now and you know if they collapse we don't have enough money\nThese guys do well I feel safer bridge is less money and guess what we can start with holes\nIn New York and New York city somebody just costs Fifteen dollars I Know I don't know if you're a truck driver I don't think a truck driver you pay by the axle you're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge\nLess money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea there many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so there you are you ... it's amazing to me\nHow we are running\nHeadlong just willing to give up everything that we have already ... the freedoms that we have and embrace democratic socialism yes\nBut we won't embrace this very American idea how do you how do you get the common sense Democrat and Republican\nWho has been raised in New York so their mentality is I mean this would sell in Texas\nHow do you get them in New York to see guys this this that it's already developed\nA forward the Republicans and they all kept giving up I mean they don't show up uh the Democrats I think I'm afraid so let's just vote Democrat the reality is again Seventy percent New Yorkers don't vote those who do vote both because of fear we can't have fear but the reason why people vote it's simply the wrong answer\nMan but I Would say that in reality I'm trying to change just to make it so that people stop voting for the last of two evils and it's that vote for someone\nAnd it is working I Am actually using if you've noticed I'm using non traditional media traditionally it does not want to cover me and polls don't want to do with me but not the media is working and I'm getting out there and people are seeing me they're responding to me and this is what's working their way to make this happen is through non traditional media and believe it or not\nPeople are getting it they actually like it I hear all the time people say\nLarry I don't agree with everything you're saying but you actually answer questions you actually have a plan and they love it and that's what I say it look my plan may be faulty maybe they well\nWe can't leave all the bridges maybe we can't raise fifty billion maybe going rate thirty million\nThat feeling when you know [laughter] okay so happy with that ... and let me ask you can I hold you over for one more break yes okay a oldie over and and tell me how we fix education\nAnd higher education it out of control its its post modernist it's indoctrinate ing and it's in ... leaving our children to debt when we come back\nTo Larry's sharp I have to tell you if I was living in New York [noise] and I was a Republican I Can't\nI cannot imagine a reason why I Would not vote for him the demo or the ... the Democrat is going to win

... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ...\nI got something last night have you seen the copy by the way hello to have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... memo yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser ah Christine afford\nShe was the she was a woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by Iraq Obama's head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nLet me say that again the woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was ... rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of\nThe year so she's not a democratic hack\nAnd also not a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in ... her expertise is on old crimes\nTo be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win\nAll right before I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any uh CNN sock it to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats\nLeft wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating\nTo you I Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this is an even he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them\nShe then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee I don't think a reasonable\nProsecutor would bring this case not to the court not for prosecution [laughter] but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nPretty significant do you think [laughter] again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl ... yeah I ... ah the homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amounts of credibility in with a left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's it ... won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why it was leaked in the final hour\nBecause every one who saw this knew exactly what it was\nNow she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several\nTimes in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute\nIt may look like she's credible are based on what she said not how she looked\n\nIf you're looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this is this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session list the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attacked change to the early eighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late\nTeens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen\nYear in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years\nIt it gets better this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report it gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged tack attack happened\nIn the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the\nEarly Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties\nPerhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties\nAnd it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post Ford narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nFor what was supposedly one of the most traumatic andme important Nick ... events of her life\nAnd a failure where we also have the late starting to develop on ice and east on the U.S gave me the bridge heading toward Avalon Boulevard

J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRace so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago\nThat they that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black man for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life and they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community they all know that he killed the Nicole\nAnd they all know it yeah so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and and let me tell you I think a doctor's poured who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt her testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nOr just a it's a series of inconsistencies that would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least its severely limits the ... the\nWindow of opportunity right so the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications ah in political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucify someone with zero evidence\nAnd then what they're doing now is that there are moving the goalposts right I I saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about ah well you know he must have drank when he was in in college or whatever who cares\nBut it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like reading at him hey Lawrence those goalpost seem kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo Shankar what we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat\nOr who uh has not lost his footing ah with with reason um\nSo the address people\nAddress people who are let's say a twenty something female that says\nYou know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes and there's also\nA a a chance that he was db Cooper ready to be ... you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a cases based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOther people that are just as qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he he's essentially being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system short of murder\nSo the question now is the commit this right and there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is the scope of tore\nRight that the guys calendar clear is that right the testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him\nSo you you have to cast that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely fine that's the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic where we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nTheirs is in the court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but you're you're you you were asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline when this happened to four times so I think people need to cast this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is to plead guilty by association ride mark judge\nI I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of this country has never met this man right so we're just going off of here see right now\nAnd based off his own memoirs of somebody who is a very quotable person who had a serious drinking issues it's not Brett ... we're we're not nominating mark judge for the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with them politically or ideologically\nThat same that's what they do and and and banana republic than a third world countries that's not what we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we\nCome back I I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second generally do you have to I'm ...
