I can remember when I was a kid there was always concerned that it was all going to get faded out not look good after several years tell me about modern siding and how long it's going to last\nWell let me let me say this and and inciting has come a long way I'm citing has additives now to it that extend the life of the color and the and they use the protection of the siding on I don't know if you've ever seen citing that you walk up to you put your hand on it and it leaves almost all white dust\nOh yes Oh absolutely absolutely\nWell that's that's the the new ... does that old siding um it Saturday now has a finished on it and and additives that that\nThey keep that from happening that oxidation from the sun um also oxidation just from from time um let me say this out and and we've had citing own homes\nFor years decades okay so when I go to a home and there's one shade of fade in Fifteen Years that is unbelievable color stay ability right\nI'm ... now and again uh signings now they're coming along way with the additives in the end the finishes that that allowed this to stay you know and and people always say well I gotta go pressure wash my side we advise everybody\nDo not pressure wash or Sadie Sadie has a finish\nI'm a pressure wash your will knock that off so wait wait till you get a plane new shouting is take a pressure spray or a a you know a pump up sprayer with a fifty fifty bleach in water mixture\nSpray it on my home and just hose at all and it looks like a brand new paint job uh I Do mine about once a year I'm usually after the wintertime and the spring will wash the house down\nUm and it doesn't take the pressure wash or to do this or you know signing um\nAdds a little bit of ... with the the the ... century that we can use on siding like I'm a lentils over above the window or dental molding around the home ... totally change the appearance of a home a\nWith lots more detail um you know added to the home\n[noise] [noise] yeah I um if I were getting vinyl siding one of the main reasons I Would go with the window world is not just a great product that you got to offer with this great our value that we're talking about\nThe I think the main thing that would attract me is just based on my previous experience with your company would be the the professional installation I just knowing that you're that you're going to put it on it I'm not going to get any better professional installation than I Would get from you\nWell and and and they lived in that the product is only as good as the ...\nRight exactly um we don't we don't a\nStaple any of our signings we hand they'll everything uh\nThe only ... that would get stapled would be your socket and that is to keep from punching in the uh the sheeting to yourself and saving those ... and the ventilation to your attic so our society is nailed on our solved it is is stable though\nAll of our medals I'm R. G. eight um aluminum coil has a thirty year light warranty so I mean\nI mean out you know that last last George I got that this\nMan said yes indeed\nAnd I mean and and and and vinyl siding you know I hear a lot of people in our area that light to use hearty board well hearty bored just like well it has to be painted you know\nOver and over again every three every two to three years and that's that's what they advise so you're going to not only are you going to pay to have this hardy board or wood siding put on but you're going to continue to pay to head pain signing is a one time cost\nAnd that ... going to do the same thing it does every day for the next Thirty years you see what I'm saying\nSam saluting it is a it again it is a money saving product with the same look and sometimes a much more elegant look then would sightings or hardy board\nOkay we've got a little less than a minute left in the show of course window world for windows and doors and hurricane products and for the vinyl siding we've been talking about and George you also do decks in fact uh what else do you do\nWell again we want to be the edge scarier ... renovation company so we do we ... we do that we do railings we didn't porch enclosures patio enclosures we do columns again we do dental molding lentils we do\nWe want to be the outside house\nOn everything except get known your ... and that's you know so I mean there's just a multitude of products that we can get to add elegance to detail and curb appeal to the home\nOkay most of the stuff we talked about today you can take a look at it at

News as secretary of state Pompeo said arriving in Mexico city for talks about the caravan of thousands of Central American migrants headed to the U.S border\nI just want to thank the Mexican government because they're stopping it hopefully before it ever gets\nTeen Ninety eight here or are they percentages of democratic fundraising in Nineteen Ninety eight they had forty three percent of all fundraising okay uh in Nineteen Ninety eight in the house two thousand it was forty seven percent two thousand two forty seven percent two thousand four forty six percent\nYou've got to see a pattern and have their little bit and you know Republicans slightly out raising them they're kind of changes in two thousand six where it goes to fifty percent Democrat than fifty six percent Democrat in two thousand eight that's brought up on his first election\nUh it's been hanging around a fifty percent ever since two thousand ten was forty eight percent doesn't twelve forty four percent doesn't fourteen forty seven percent doesn't sixteen fifty percent so you get that there's a range there from about forty three to fifty six percent that is broken and I'm fifty six was outlier most of the time it's right between forty seven fifty fifty one\nSo far in ... in two thousand Eighteen Democrats have raised sixty five percent of the money going to the house well again they've never been higher than fifty six sixty five percent a sixty five thirty five split against Republicans\nThey are out there was a congressman who came out the other day he raised eight hundred thousand dollars in his district thought he did a good job his opponent announced two point six million ... this is like it's unheard of when it comes to money and the disparity going on now\nThat we're ... the Democrats are favored to take the house I don't know how much it has to do with money\nBut if they were to lose this race would be a with this sort of a climate it would be a complete destruction\nOf any argument that money can buy elections I mean this is they're they're gonna complain I mean Beto O'Rourke was on stage complaining with Ted Cruz about money and how Ted Cruz's influenced by your ... made a hundred thousand dollar donation to him like I like this is a big a big deal in today's world um but I mean he's\nHe's raised this doesn't even clue Beto he's thirty eight million dollars more than any Senate candidate himself in history yeah for a quarter or which is incredible you said it was it compares to ... bottom was raising and what she really wants\nMore in the in the ah if you compare quarter last quarter of the campaign in two thousand eight he raised more than ... Obama during his presidential\nCandidate that's a presidential election emphasizing this is the Texas Senate ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win a\nNow it's funny in the Senate race record she broke\nWas the what was the ... record set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember senator lousy oh from New York for and against Hillary Hillary he did not win that race was not a close race even though Rick laws you wasn't a bad candidate it was kind of a close race\nIt was Hillary right in New York [noise] expect her to win but I mean again ear between Iran and fifty in almost every it's almost a fifty fifty split every year and this you're sixty five thirty five\nThat's a ... um and the other thing that's\nKind of interesting on the in the bad side if you want to get scare mongering for awhile and why not lens out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately um we haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all we all week on well now in the last two days with knowing how we just you know we have a going back in history looking at\nTwo hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent\nEight percent of them are getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running for Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now is that a big difference I mean sixteen percent it's still not high\nBut it does show that Republicans wind up losing these incumbency race is a little bit more often if you're worried about\nThe Senate there's a little bit of there's a little bit of something there should be worried about I think they're going to win the Senate I think you're gonna see a fifty three or fifty four seat majority I think they may pick up a couple of seats oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas\nAre those who were in question I rely all you've I I think Ted winds up winning by maybe ten points or more\nI think it'll be a double digit I think that's a good chance of that I wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten\n... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it'll be much closer than really comfortable yeah for I think that's where he stands right now yeah uh Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida that in ... Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't even put that on the top ... yeah well I saw it's close but don't they pretty much a toss up race but those other I mean Florida is a complete ...\nReason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it\nI don't know how to do a rifle junior I mean I'm Talking about West Virginia here\nI think Joe mentioned uh probably sealed his reelection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that brand they're all bumped up up the system when I have to\nUm I don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this you complain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain about a summer cold Lisa Murkowski\nJoe mansions voting record is much worse than all of them\nAll of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest conservative of all\nTime I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate guy he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because Democrats are now communist again the socialist in communist yeah I mean the most\nPart you think about Jeff Flake here's a guy who's getting flooded so so much by the White House and buy or the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for head for that seat that the seat and Mick Sally is running for\nA well he votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah\nYou know again ... West Virginia is the state is probably the most pro Trump state in the union\nHe won in West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it was czar they would go for I mean I imagine it's got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate\nOr you know you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capital almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota but I mean in in\nWest Virginia it got mentioned you got his cabinet vote you have a couple of it but again this is a guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a\nHe's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but is that what West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently sold though he seems to be leading in the polls is an interesting development there\nAre but I did a winnable should be winnable seat in this environment uh right now mentions leading that won fairly comfortable but even without the mentioned seat you're you're at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four without going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one it would be a\nReal surprise if they lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there is a good you know eighty percent chance that there are the most models that are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota uh she's down by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven points to the Republican Kevin ... so yeah that's looking pretty good yeah my seat\nThere I think honestly you had two races decided by the cabinet vote one was mansion ... high camp her vote against that feel that I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race though\nI don't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose it I think she's going to lose a pretty big I would not be surprised as you said that double digits situation happens there yeah look at again North Dakota as a conservative state ... are\nThey are looking at high camp and\nYou know I think a lot of people like to say well we've got this one Democrat this is what we've got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got you know democratic governor we've got a democratic senator and there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way when you vote against\nKavanaugh in those circumstances with the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is\nEmbracing the same sort of standard you're seeing from Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and all of these far left figures and good for North Dakota for just seeing her as a a as a result\nAnd that it looks good yeah it looks that way yeah yeah there's some uh optimistic things there it could but the dangers there as well I mean this this is going to be an interesting one and ... and not the thing that's really unfortunate is if if that happens\nLet's say the result is and I think this will be a good result for Republicans right now\nWhich is you get fifty three or fifty four senators in there and you lose the house but you lose it narrowly\nYou lose it let's say by eight or ten a seat you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in certain circumstances but it's going to be difficult and I think there's going to be almost nothing they can get through\nAlmost nothing with the exception of maybe some bipartisan spending bills which still find ways to get those ... I'm sure of it but other than that you're gonna get any real advantage not getting any tax stuff you're you're going to have tough times with any regulation\nYou're going to get ... you know none of this stuff is going to be easy as long as you keep running a massive deficit you'll get all those bills through yeah yeah just keep spending money and they'll vote for it yeah yeah it's not a problem to show you the house at how dramatic it is at least by the polls look and I know you're going to say well the polls got the last thing wrong well some of it they got right\nA and a lot of it they got rights including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national polls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know what let's hope we're not sure but right now the models are showing\n'em there is a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats could pick up eighty three seats a to point one percent chance to really unlikely like you say that that an absolute no what's that going to get to eighty three right ...\nKind of like having your own personal pinch\nYou don't have to worry about whether the market is up or down\nThe political headlines in the news\nThen scheduling one on one meeting you know charge to find\nVirginia O'Brian offers investment services to\nInsurance in the new he's offered to\nA\nLiving enjoy mobile bay I developers big loss can be your big game Saturday October twenty seven to listen to this opportunity on a two acre waterfront would cover both dogs are mobile bay just thirty nine nine only minutes from downtown\nBecause the roads and improvements alone were more than the selling price shepherd he's premium waterfront property two acres thirty nine nine that's painting on the dollar imagine coming home jumping on your boat and heading out on mobile bay enjoy fishing boating swimming or just relaxing on the water beats working in the back yard\nTo acres underwater with covered boat docks at a bargain price one day only sales Saturday October twenty seventh\nOnly ate lots of ... don't do like you'll love what you see excellent financing available color click eight seven seven big view dot com for an earlier appointment that eight seven seven big view eight seven seven big view age seven seven to for for eight for three now that's\nBeen lazy by what are we talking about me ask you this what okay what do you think the chances are that University in Tuscaloosa, Alabama won the national championship real I mean that's what we're talking about\nBecause it ... at the University in Tuscaloosa, Alabama got Fifteen and now I have twins national championship you get your project is that something you're let's just would be interested in you bet it is how\nI mean everybody can get it right on the furniture they sent me to get down here\nDuring the thirty six hours say while they're hundreds of thousands of dollars a perjury ... to give away went to a perfect season one for the money for that show three to get ready only thirty six hours left to\nDo is you know and if it doesn't you can do something about that one\nOut of town a lot to you\nKnow for information about contests on this station go to news radio seven ten dot com slash ...\n[noise] now jumbled un GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC fifty five\nThey're Happy Friday I'm Jake done from NBC Fifteen or on her way to eighty four this afternoon with a chance of showers and storms they will lead into the evening hours maybe impacting some outdoor activities including\nFriday night football will quiet things down the late tonight we fall into the upper sixties it's upper seventies on Saturday with a fifty percent chance of showers and storms\nIt's cooler but dry on Sunday with the high end the low seventies subject done for this I heart radio station when the weather changes\nUse the NBC did not do stay dry\nFrom the all clear plumbing in free studio goals do five ... says these radio seven ten W.

illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it uh you know in a hawkish manner ... right\nAnd you know like a thousand people are kinda qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion\nRight it feels like waiting does there just top like they're they're taught the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right look over running the security\nThey they're they're you're coming in or the right way or the overriding security and you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet\nOr the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a fairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful\nUh were uncaring were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy of\nCourse if somebody's snakes from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they go and work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with send back then\nThey ... they send back them back if they do it without permissions they sent back them but we can't uh were expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to U.S Mexico has a pretty stiff immigration law they've got to streamline law\nThat insurers foreign visitors and immigrants\nAre in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society\nThey are of economic and social benefit to society\nWeight you're you expect your immigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they are demanding writes a that they think they have coming to them\nIn Mexico you can't even go can't interfere in their in internal politics plus\nIf they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport I mean that's a [noise] a\nDaily racist right I mean like that is not yes there's not an argument there we would never know you can't do that you know you can't do that and nor should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans and the ... percent we want to make sure we're still keep Seventy or eighty percent yeah I mean I think I Would you I Would ... I Can't I Can't think\nOf one Trump supporter who would ... support a policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages of white people versus other races you what you want to people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society\nOr going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it\nI mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible lying to buy it really is it's ... ... security for me but not for me and that is not a a that is not a ... that's incredible I mean that's an incredible it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's\nPolitically wanting to plug the bottom line is we are we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up\nThat is a completely little larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there's no like this is a complete gift\nTo the Republicans to people who care about the border yeah people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting ice the gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that yeah saying hey use their use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration because I haven't heard any of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe someone someone somewhere is\nBut it doesn't seem to be a general theme for the party\nI did hear at all talking about it in the debate and I I don't think I don't know you mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security that I mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where I'm at Sally has a I think a great chance of winning or people to get because her opponent there is like\nIf you took Michael Moore and put him in his brain into a female body of congresswoman\nYou would have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's bashing Arizona oh yeah hang it's the lab of democracy she saying people are crazy in Arizona she's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truther shows I mean she is\nAs it's incredible but they decided to run her and just and thought that this stuff would not come out\nAnd and ... you know you're talking about a ... uh one of the first female pilots in history and the air the air force are incredibly accomplished has a great chance of winning in in a tough environment uh in Arizona adding on this situation where\nAre you know your he makes gives a coat pink worker a coat of paint staffer is running for Senate in Arizona and it\nWas a huge mistake I think for her to be their number they really with go pick or I don't I'm that socializing her views I don't know exactly she she's been with a lot of these uh left wing extreme groups or some maize any early to thousands to the point where again\nLike she co hosted a show with someone who was the nine eleven truther Wilder awhile\nThat's like crazy bunkers over the line right and and the fact that you have a really solid candidate there in Arizona as a border state it's a big deal there ... is another one the cruise cruise has got to lead there but I mean he's always been talking about what her security but\nYeah I get a look at the other side of that yeah with Beto\n... doesn't want no all he doesn't I I don't know that even wants to border frankly now it just doesn't seem like it and he's made a big deal out of it some of those ads are like let's protect the dreamers let's let's protect the dreamers and you know what it means\nIt means amnesty for everybody it doesn't stop with the dreamers and ...

Albert or Gilbert ... your folks your friends your community calls you bet though that's that's my nickname that are gone a bart for my entire life I'm born and raised in the fourth generation in El

... you're called a Beto and Frank twice ...\nBecause that's true I agree just learned that amazing actors now remember I didn't realize to keep that it's not just El Paso and also in the ... all over Texas yeah it is apparently what's true here yeah um and and I one of the things I Would love to do today\nTo see to test this it\nIt true that there is no example of someone named Robert Albert Gilbert or a baritone who was not named uh what they eat it looks so if you were Gilbert and people call you Gilbert apparently tobacco you do not exist you are not a person you're not a it's like we just we have no evidence\nThat you exist so if you happen to be a Robert an Albert Gilbert or an embarrassingly small\nFearing baritone and obviously you're probably going to have a Hispanic nickname right that's kind of a Hispanic man I Would probably getting better though yeah I Would I don't know what you would shorten too except maybe that's how I guess I I I don't I don't know any um people who are not Hispanic yeah who are named ...\nAnd and this is an opportunity for us a pet and do a two white white white ... we're talking Whitey Whitey to the ... the two of the white is people you'll ever know with almost no cultural awareness whatsoever\nTo be learned here we can be taught about the uh Hispanic culture I mean Beto ... has been white explaining us ah some Hispanic culture here over the past few months\nBut I Would like to know from people who actually grew up in these areas is it true that every one I'm sure there are some examples I can think of one off the top of my head whose name Robert for instance a work in calls himself Beto but is there is this a common thing to the point of\nI Believe his standard was everyone who gets ... named one of those names in Texas or in in this community needs communities would be referred to as bad [laughter]\nIs it possible is there a unicorn out there that is named Robert and his only called Bob\nIs there's someone out there who is named Albert is called al ... is that is that a unicorn is that I missed the call being or does that exist eight eight seven to seven back eight eight Seventy seven to three to five if you happen to be someone named Robert\nAirborne in El Paso or grew up in El Paso or lower mckell and yeah I mean more along the border are wrong the border and access in southern Texas somewhere or I suppose it would also apply in Arizona right now or ...\nYeah any any I mean he didn't he limited it to I Would say Texas border area but I Would I be interested to see if this is a widespread phenomenon yeah is it possible cannot ... mother\nNamed their kid Gilbert and not have been referred to as best show their entire life is that a possibility I don't know I Am just not in tune to the cultural development as much as I should be and you know please\nCome and and and whites plane this to us because we are just that's not a role here that we're just two white and understand things like that to to let ... let me let me just admitted to me\nThe ... referring to himself has Beto feels like a guy who wants to take advantage of the Hispanic community for votes I and I know that can't be true because but it's just because I'm too white to understand it I Can't quite get their cat clear that hurdle to understand why someone would do that\nAnd we will soon find out to see if we
