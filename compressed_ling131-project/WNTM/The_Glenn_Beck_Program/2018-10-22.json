warning would only benefit uncle Henry on Youth Radio in Germany when GM real and I urge radio station ... three immobile\nIs exactly he becomes amazing they have no idea what he did they have no idea who he is but he's the rebellion guy so he becomes a symbol of it by on the left I mean don't get me wrong or that people on the left or exactly who these people are of course there are but that's often the leadership I'm Talking the average every person who votes\nThey just know what's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I actually talk I talk about ways of making people better I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life\nLiberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about this I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness sorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there are many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal I'd hang on weight before it surely stuff let's start with out many Haitian go with ... absolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all standardized testing proud of high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because satirized testing is it unfair way of getting teachers it's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who at ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well ... and it's known in case\nIt is and what are we finding the funding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons is family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests or the stupid and to be some become successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way you should go where your book liberties are not a bad idea but ten years old why it's to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in the school prior to Nineteen eighty and that was I proudly Nineteen eighty there really was the department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information ... ... they might do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states somehow learn how to read\nWrite survive in the world without and at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school districts did a good job somehow that worked\nOut of the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse\nAnd they give you a quick rundown of every single time centralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some low class control and the only guy saying let teachers teach than I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready so nice testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not in the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows while riding granted measures were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state\nWhy regulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one saying these things because I crossed the entire state might say that's easy to counties across all ... to\n... get the full sharp by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders than teachers the average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminish it makes it over a hundred and fifty among\nYou dump a couple of minutes raiders you hide my teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten the last two years of high school for too many kids is\nJim study hall video games and probably smoking weed ... that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is their teeth grade it's removed because they're not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWas terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we say and wonder why he has no work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally\nNow I have people who were telling me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is will be able to show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead\nKitchen that five choices they they take a test they get a hospital plumber number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally and the lie is the\nOnly way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind the desk and it for a new computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think called you right for me I go to a two year ... to ... ... is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves Dr teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who goes back to the gate not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory down okay yeah so um so that kid who's really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and get to to integrate why should they be bored in school and they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now worries go to a two year trade school go to trace could become a plumber carp and do whatever you want to be a mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty\n... that's a problem I let my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in New York City doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that will get a job\nNot go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation if they had to go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nAllow it sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelve right I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use good luck\nHere's what I'm his wife ... going to happen\nA bunch of cool prep schools will pop up\nA bunch of great trade schools will pop up yes how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars ... well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will actually give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when these schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year for the last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each\nTwelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders is more than four billion dollars\nWe saved all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders at ... at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... ethnic or the unhappy kids now thinking about this lemon twelfth grade you're in eleventh twelfth grader you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nTo build their kid isn't there the kids in something else the kids a bully because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's a bully but now he go someplace else your teacher lemons fourth grade discipline problems almost go away why all the kids want to be there they've taught\nWas killing our children isn't guns was going to have children as lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness that killing our kids put them in these worlds all that goes away\nI Can't go shoot my fellow friend the teachers have me you know build a rocket with my class I\nCan't go ... the farm and he's going to fix a tractor I got things to do I've I've purpose I meaning I don't do things like that anymore we're\nLiving in a world of

should be the marketer and chief\nNot not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's always not only\nDoing that he's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often it's normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants to insurance force firearm now we can't get it\nThere's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more well how do they need insurance now\nWhen when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore\nQuite for any kind a firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yet and that's the unethical part that's the issue\nRight and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by the fault no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we have a ... if you

literally what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before a complete legally totally above board you are now a violent selling it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons

a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the Senate and lose the house or at least makes it possible since capital that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance\nA very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight would be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are at Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid ... two thousand six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively so\nRelatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of seats um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races there favored in\n... and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happened the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where the down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that's been losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things can be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still hasn't even they're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still going to have investigative power gonna have subpoena power you're going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive while we're on a blue wave\nTo now almost laying the foundation of [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah well your weight loss but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had a bad a better chance that this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all toss up and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh thing now I mean I think it's a real ... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling at the ... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate\nAs you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten or fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like chipping away I'm the type of course a blanket role but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and\nThat may just be because they're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder because I Would consider myself an independent yeah\nAnd there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know with that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being right higher likelihood that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats like yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so and the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way at any time between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming\nA more rigid in and we were ... could come down\nTo the independence mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... that I mean\nI Would think their disgust with what's going on right [laughter] if anything\nThey don't like the overall system there's one other interesting just out of here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's there's burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense night in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent two dozen fourteen was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number is now jumped\nIn October of two dozen itching to Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while it was going on is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats\n[noise] is it I mean the only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan\nRefugees what else has happened I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh\nUnaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages you know I was in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand Eighteen polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls are for that ... are OK I'm all the October ones obviously after including then include the migrants a caravan situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only place it's low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine percent in two thousand sick\nThing about a five mile delaying now on ain't in West you're traveling from Daphne to move the old than a crash on the way west bound in the left lane and near battleship\nPark when the wind for some swelling in both directions nine mile route between ... and you can also the Nobel an accident on airport boulevard at ... university boulevard with time saver traffic I'm Lisa Baquet\n[noise] now doubled you when GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen\nAnd with a look at your Monday weather forecast I'm chief meteorologist Chris done from NBC\nFifteen cloudy skies tonight and most of us will stay dry or maybe a few sprinkles around fifty seven for the low Seventy one on Tuesday forty percent chance of passing showers most of that close to the coast\nDry weather for Wednesday warming up to Seventy six and then a stronger storm moves in on Thursday bumper storms a good bet Seventy degrees on Thursday I'm chief meteorologist Chris done for NBC Fifteen news and this I heart radio station is\nOctober twenty second what's new today on the free I our radio shack out I was talking to her radio resentment inside a studio featuring a brand new episode with the legendary\nPaul McCartney none of them and treat taunted sound with Joe leaving the talking about his new album Egypt agent and of course some discussion about a little band called double beat also we were ... when we were playing music I heart radio present in the studio check it out now\nNot June the second highest October opening weekend of all time just behind venom Halloween dominated the weekend with a massive Seventy seven million for ten million dollar budget and film also set a new record for highest October opening day of her hand picked up a good be plus into a score from audience there's already a money maker and there is a good chance of\nMore Michael Meyers coming to\nA star is born spent a third straight weekend in the number two slot counting Nineteen million Seventeen day total is now up to one hundred twenty six million and with limited direct competition and to a bohemian Rhapsody opens next month one looks to climb up to at least one hundred sixty five million or so by the end of his rod\nSlipping back to a certain place venom took in an additional Eighteen million to give it a Seventeen day total of one hundred and Seventy one million paints also strong across the world with an international total just shy of three hundred million\nGoose bumps two hundred Halloween repeated a number four with nine million over the weekend for ten day total of twenty eight million and first ma'am clocked in in fifth place with a million giving it a total just shy of thirty million over two weekends\nI'm actually a weekend box office we view on hard radio [noise]\nChecking out the movies this weekend Fisher box office\nBased on the twenty twelve novels firing point their reaction thriller hunter killer Gerard Butler stars as us submarine commander who's crew is tasked with sneaking into foreign water is to rescue kidnapped Russian President to try and avoid World War three Gary Oldman who's gone and Linda ...

unhappiness and so I think it's very important to um as far right as they come on the right versus left continual but it's very important to remember that the purpose of politics is to maintain a framework for ordered liberty so that you can go live in the communities of love where you're actually raising your kids and built\nA better mouse trap or app or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left or they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are\nThey're anti constitution so\nYou know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about politics but at what point do you see good people\nSay enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end ... what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did a to Nancy Pelosi and California\nHow are you aware does did to Mitch McConnell at all in shallow and Kentucky exactly battered\nBecause there is no second or third just moved from there\nThat doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that\nPeople don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off the table and so on and on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have persuasion as any goal\nThe the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rant which headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking a beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is ...\nItaly built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I I'm In\nI'm In the middle of a little downtown to sort of restored downtown and Omaha right now\nAnd there's no end to fight here and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media ecology in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties sixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy\nSo that it was sixty percent of households that that basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content\nBut it was shared content and there was an American way\nWhen you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics or you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two there are still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured\nThat I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans\nShould do is ignored them [noise]\nSo what is our\nOur we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time is the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone\nYeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nSo yes ... or ... them out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said\nThe first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from the fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity\nThat way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia which\nIs that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense to death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness\nIs do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy\nAnd that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um
