of nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice he was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan ... trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part to overeat budding emerge\nRunning a murderer is now on the free I our radio I just open the\nMy on your smart on Google and listen to news radio doubled in the M you and I are in radio\nYou are you\nKnow boom boom\nBoom I Do a\nLot at home\nReal saw those is on the\nYeah\nKnow the thing you know what a guy that was Tony ... it has to Jesus Christ show I Am\nYour holy host happened to be with you or this Sunday as am every single Sunday right here\nAnswering your questions and talking about things that truly matter in life and the afterlife here's a a really quick way to tell whether you're listening to Portuguese or not if you hear it and go oh that's pretty Spanish\nNo ... no a French oh an Italian if you say those three things the fourth choice should be Portuguese and you'll be right\nJust a little tip for me to you know\nWe started earlier today talking about the concept of paganism and how it permeates really everything the that if as a believer you are trying to run from\nAnything dealing with paganism that you will have an easier time trying to pick an actor who hasn't\nBeen in a film with who Tony Kevin Bacon\nAnd that is to say that they're there in life or any culture that cultures are built upon really ah somebody living in a place looking to the left in looking to the right and seeing what the natural resources are to make clothing\nOr to make food and this becomes the culture\nSo if you know you see the uh Mexican culture to culture or um you see\nYou know to decide you see a Native American culture or you keep looking around and seeing oh well this is the German culture and if you pull them apart you'll start seeing that they intertwined quite a bit\nAnd the Mexican culture the use of certain instruments including a\nYou know are playing a certain types of songs that sound like they're ... when you when you hear them go where did that come when that comes from Germany\nSo when you see these things or or hear them and you go well where did this come from where you'll find that they melt together or American Indians are no longer living in the peace will culture changes and grows and uh\nIt's not that to the accordion was native to Mexico it's that it's brought there and then it gets used in ah the foods if you look at the region\nUh I'm I'm always humor by people that go into different parts\nOf Central America and all I can start looking for\nA thirty is thinking well right they they've got beans\nThat rice they've got no they don't and that there's different even though there's gonna be similarities in certain places are going to be differences and others and this is the same with religion or face you have the word of God which is in in scripture\nAnd pointing to things both culturally that\nWere going on in the time both with Kagan's and with\nA are Jewish brothers and sisters and these things are all taking part in going in different directions serving a particular purposes\nAnd still are intertwined with their immediate cultures as well the food of the day and the you know the the you think of the Passover you think of the things that are taking place with the breaking of bread that's all because that was the culture of the time\nSo some things around religion will change as well\nIf you want to read yourself of all pagan concepts it's not about Halloween Halloween really although it's a derivative or if you traced all the way back to sow in\nWhich was a Celtic festival yes where you can say well that's pagan but then you have a pope Gregory the third\nDesignating November first is all saints day than the day prior automatically became all Hallows eve and that becomes Halloween so it has a Christian twist throughout the centuries as well\nAnd you start looking at these things and seeing that it's more than just the obvious and that's what I Want from you when you're using discernment discern not just based on the obvious but about a true understanding about what's going on there are things in Christianity that uh our our ... our direct result of paganism across\nMost certainly the fish and the application of the fish fish most certainly\nYou look you know at the uh the symbol for Virgo you can look it up on line\nAnd you'll see the fish imbedded in that very simple along with the Hebrew character from ... you'll you'll see these things there's there's more to it than just to clean lineage and that's because people are participating in it doesn't mean have\nThe economic on in your house or ... grams or it's not what I'm

silver as a hedge against inflation I'm here with Ron of what we're going to find jewelry runners now good time to do that\nI think it is if I could put every single way and not sell a single thing I Would but of course I'd be out of business so I have to buy and sell gold and silver bowling and all the time and I can't say historically but for the last three to five years is probably the lowest it's been in the most affordable spend it a long time when\nSomebody gets gold and silver as a hedge against inflation do they necessarily need to buy large amounts you\nKnow we have people to come in and just by one silver diamond people to come in and spend five to ten thousand dollars depending on what their needs are I mean if you have a large portfolio or a large savings or investment four one K. four one K. account that you need to protect you need to get a larger hedge if you're just trying to protect a small amount of smaller hitch works you don't have to start big\nUm it's the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent or said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out\nIn this time in favor of the Democrats it started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's a type of gap that leads you to lose the ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible ... cents Kavanaugh that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance of very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid two dozen six midterms\nI'm and I'm which is which is crazy\nIt is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen even if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nYou know relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you look at kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's that's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if there would be able to sweep all of the races their favorite and\nUh and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those\nRepublicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is\nWe know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some places you know whether the down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split it's going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they loose that's been losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has may even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on a train in the house you're still gonna have investigative power to have subpoena power are going to have been\nPosted nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation\nOf a oh\nYeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh facing a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of them\nBy chance but I mean they had a bad a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate paths to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all taught supper and some of them looked like they might be leading Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's a real a real it's really going to come to the independence how are the independence feeling\nAt the ... there is an interesting group because they are not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten were fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because part of ... and gauge more like typically um that's of course a blanket robots typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and she doesn't eat uh Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder\n'cause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know with that four percent jump\nWas it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican\nJust because the left has gone in saying\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever the ... that being said uh you know I vote Republican\nI mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats like yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way it anytime between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that's ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming\nA more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything\nOr they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting this out of here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked about ... a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters so ah in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal since ... in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen ... Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while they were not as high as in two thousand six for Latino voters wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats\nIs it I mean the only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan\nRefugees what else has happened I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh\nUnaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages in July or August ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls are for that so after okay um all the October ones obviously after ... men include the migrant a caravan situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would ... the only place it's low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine perform in two thousand ...\nSays no it is their whole lives that this is going to be interesting it is like it's like\nYou know back in the nineties the opening of Star Wars yeah it's this is now what people care about and they care about it in almost a cultural entertainment sort of way be which I think fascinating\nAnd not necessarily healthy [noise] that's good that people care about these things you know I don't think that people a lot of people don't seem to care about them about the issues as much as they do about just the passionate disagreement with whoever they're on Facebook where we have\nAnd we can say ... did not deserve to die this way nobody deserves to die that that way however\nShe's not the guy that everybody in the press is making him out to be he's not some freedom loving guy\nHe's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs the Muslim Brotherhood that he was pushing for was an Islamic\nState\nHe wants an Islamic state in his own writing in the Washington Post says yeah we have to have a an Islamic assist rule\nIf you dismiss as Islam assist rule under surreal law then you'll never have peace in the middle east well wait a minute I'm not against Islam I Am against Islamic rule\nSharia law tell me where it's working out show to me where is that working out where is it protecting human rights no thank you I mean\nIslamic rule just by none other group of Islam is is what you have in Saudi Arabia no thank you\nI'm going to give some of the facts of of this guy and it's not a conspiracy\nThere was a conspiracy to commit murder to hide it and\nWe have found is that [noise]\nNow America needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue but let's not paint\n... into some freedom loving friends because\nMobiles paid for a jungle mornings on news radio seven ten doubled un P.

still talk about things that we had in common\nWhat's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now and they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two\nThere are still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media as if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope for a viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignoring\nThem [noise]\nSo what he is are\nAre we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the things that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nSo yes ... a a player but soon I'm Out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you\nJust said the first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe ... day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity that way bigger than their policy preferences\nAnd so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature if you will out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents\nHave known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forests and statistically the number one driver of happiness\nIs do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if those four things are true or even if three of the four true you're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe\nThat we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of stick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this ah and you're looking over the horizon and we want to talk about that we are talking to Ben Sasse\nHis new book is called them

divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them a why we hate each other is an awareness that\nThere's actually national security exposures for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people that live in the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise] [noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took a sweat twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes

Sabbath Fox's gr now Scott has the latest live\nThey just know what's happening now isn't working that's why people listen to me when I actually talk I talk about ways of making people better I I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life liberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about that I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness\nSorry so tell me about that was struck there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about uh education I I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making hemp and the candidates legal\nI hang up before it short lived with me I should go into education\nAbsolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all centralized testing prior to high school I Know and talking about doing that because they're nice testing is unfair way of bringing teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools\nAnd it makes kids what ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and it's known a case of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests and feel stupid and to be some come successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy standardized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined where you should go or you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why it's to keep control of what's happening in the schools I'm not okay with that\nNow you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about how many do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states some help on how to read\nWrite survive in the world without at at a department education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked\nAt the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse and they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some low class control and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready to testing you will lose about we will lose in New York state we lose about four billion dollars\nFunding it's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion so losing four billion not in the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose at four billion meals loose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators go away and then it shows what riding granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive\nWhy regulations rules checking boxes and the only ones saying nice things because I crossed the entire state might say that's easy to counties across all sixty two\nI'm going to fool sharp by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders then teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average ministry makes over a hundred and fifty ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you hide my teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done wind the world we have K. to twelve neat K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably some that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirteenth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWest terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we say I wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who would tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAt one uh ... told me said Laurie my interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is for people to show up at the clock in the morning it is so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course\nAt sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey can ... number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind the desk and ... and the computer all day mhm that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think called you write to me I go to a two year prep school to get prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go to years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready I graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who goes back to the gate and I thought sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory it okay yes I Do um so that kid was really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and get to to get a great why should they be bored in school and they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things no worries go to your trade school choice to become a plumber corporate or whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old\nMy problem is they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough and you're doing it's a problem so do that we don't like that go get a job\nWhy not go learn a work work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation is filthy yeah to go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nA lot of these

amazing\nThere is the best part when he schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year these last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each twelve thousand times the four hundred thousand ... is more than four billion dollars\nWe saved all of the federal funds\nWe've removed tons of administrators\nWe've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core a we've made teenagers

WN GM\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat come in with Larry sharp I'm doing a story on candidate a for a for New York uh\nHe is libertarian and uh is making waves in New York and he's a voice that you should hear because his his policies are different than the Republican and the Democrats and I believe they're very very workable in a\nIn an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system or you know that feels like the old Soviet size styles centralized system is beyond me but I'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um\nYou are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is pushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment\nA and trying to de platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for governor to impede business period\nNo ifs ands or buts if I don't like in the industry or like something I never said if I Want to our freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief\nI should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's not only\nDoing that she's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants to insurance forest firearm\nNow we can't get it there's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more widely and insurance now\nWhen when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yes and that's the unethical part that's the issue right and this is you're\nMaking New York state residents criminals overnight not just say if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by the fault no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in the state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight\nAnd we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant say fact was passed and twenty Thirteen and it's a fact said that certain aspects of a firearm make it legal or illegal literally ... what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before completely totally above board you are now a violent felons\nIt was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to not joking is true story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes all the cops worth ... revamp all because of that in other words but it now if you're retired cop once you retire well now you're a felon again\nYou know I'm an actor to come up\nThis this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad\nThe the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy ... constantly who project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a businessman\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over a million since he's ascendant thrown over a million ... leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet\nRight in it yes it's so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they are pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we're Lilly who had literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes so let's take pensions do chew pensions\nAre ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises ... who worked their whole life and were promised ally yeah what do you do\nYou see it here in Texas would you believe for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you'd have already
