{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "Um how important are the pictures\nOr you know next to the price the the pictures would be the most important thing that the most important part of the marketing because if you don't have great pictures to get it\nI use a professional photographer that's how important it is and you know I ... I spent quite a bit of money\nOver the course of the ear on the photography um but it sells houses you know because of the Internet\nPeople have the opportunity to look at all this stuff on line and if your pictures aren't great they're just going to say next right\nUh you know it used to be that the agent figured out what people were going to go see based on what they want it that's not the way it is today by the time they come to you they've been on the Internet for six months\nI mean they've been looking and looking and looking and um\nThey gonna they're gonna be real involved with what they see a because they have the ability and it's great that they have the ability it helps ... helped me narrow it down um so the pictures are critical um\nWhen I was looking for a house there were homes that I was very interested in neighborhoods I was very interested in but if there weren't a lot of pictures or just a few\nI immediately eliminated it as a possibility of going to look at that house because I felt like something must be wrong\nIf there are only three or four pictures and they're not good pictures\nYeah you're right that that's what everybody thinks if you don't show the back yard why I'm at once called an agent because um you know I look at the pictures to before I show houses and or\nIs it you know I'm looking for houses for buyers just like they're looking for houses for themselves and one came up a we have what we call hot cheat it's that everything that's happening immediately so we have access to it\nSo I have access to the house is at the minute they come on the market or if this price change\nAnd it's called the hot chick and so I'm looking at the hot sheet one came up and I said well this looks promising there was no pictures kitchen\nI mean that's one of the most important things you don't you know a lot of houses you don't show bathrooms because bathrooms unless it less the bathroom is enormous\nUh it just it it's pretty hard to take pictures of it right um so that's not unusual that you don't see a bathroom but it's pretty unusual you don't see a kitchen so I called the age and I said why isn't\nKitchen and he said because it's the only part of the house that hasn't been remodeled\n[laughter] so what are you trying to do surprise people [laughter] are they you know uh so the house didn't work I mean they were looking for a house that had been completely re done\nAnd the price certainly didn't reflect that the kitchen hadn't been re done so anyway that's important\nYou know show pictures and how many pictures do you so you use a pro how many pictures do you think you are you should use\nWell you know it depends on the size of the house really\nUh it's not unusual for me to have fifty forty or fifty pictures in okay you can't put that Betty and the MLS so I just I put them on a link okay so I just click on it um\nBut I think the MLS allows us twenty five or so pictures I normally use that out um but uh if the photographer I'd I'd put on there with the photographer gives me and usually it's forty to fifty pictures\nOkay so it's that it's that important that you put that money on their\nYeah not only that rubbish brothers doesn't video a so we have a video on there\nA ... that are you going to do is click on a so this you know there's people want pictures and so we give to them um and then we put it everywhere known to man on the Internet\nAh because you want to be where people um are looking up the robbers brothers site is the most looked at real estate site in in a ... a south Alabama uh they it's phenomenal the number of people that are\nWent through that site ah but what I was phenomenal it's we have a new listings page and a new listings on that for two weeks and I mean that is really sought after a we also have an open house page\nAnd they stay on that for about a week if they've had an ... if they are having a pet an open house because people are still people are looking before and after you know I'm I'm so uh and that site is ... pages is real popular\nUm they're also we're also an jello but I Want to point out to people's Zimmer was accurate I'm sill oh\nShe'll get see active listings but they don't know when the listings or poll because they've been sold or they've been taken off the market so you can be looking at something that\nIs no longer available or are they what they would reflect the price change because it's pulled from the MLS but their information isn't updated in terms of\nSales so I'll have people call me want to see how soft yellow that I sold a month ago okay [laughter] so you know the the better place to be looking for for accuracy is rubbish brothers dot com or Sandy fresh dot com\nBecause that stuff is up to them in it\nAnd it and it pulled when something is sold or or or is no longer on the market\nUh before we run out of time or if somebody hires you and they go through this process with you that you've already described during the program\nA wants all the pictures are taken and it's in the middle class and you put the sun in the yard what happens or you've done or you still grinding\n... okay [laughter] I'm Still doing stuff\nUh we we all we do a lot of marketing be on the Internet on social media or on a especially Facebook or Instagram um YouTube um places that that people are looking constantly I'm I'm constantly putting it on Facebook\nPlus rubbish brothers has an automatic feet put it on Facebook but I don't think it's often enough to do it to\n'em and um you know making sure agents are aware that ah the properties on the market uh\nAnd also keeping up to date with the the clients I mean I follow up on every shelling [noise] um I I calling the agents or texting them until they finally tell me how the showing when or if they're not after me then obviously we don't have a sale but I Want to know why\nOr what caused the buyer and not be interested in the house because it's something we can fix I'm going to fix it\nOr try to get it fixed um uh so that we can get the house so I'm so that they're going to hear from me a lot because I personally call to get the feedback\nI people who work for me but it's not so that they can talk to the clients so that I have time to talk to the point\nWhere at a time we could go on for quite some more time with Sandy Ross you can find out more by going to say be bras dot com that Sandy frost dot com or you can call her six so four sixty five fourteen to five one six so four sixty five fourteen say at least last [noise]\nSo when you're on your way to

wherever we fall there either I still like I don't but like if you if you're let's say if somebody's like John write a joke about smoking pot yeah I don't know\nOf that world Syria so it's not going to be that the bright standing by knowledge is really like\nSmoke pot and then went to Taco Bell like that's all I I Know the ... eighty thousand foot view of that life but he was talking about like Christian culture growing up in church just south of sports like these are kind of area where I live like\nRight after this bit of this was like a lady that has a Bible verse for every type of situation and people like how'd you memorize all those versus like\nThat in my head that's just I I live that life and it's just in my head I run them memorized let's just do it so you're going to be a great comic stick to what and you know and a lot of people say you should like when I when I Lived in Hollywood for four or five years and they were like hey you need to get rid of this like\nChristian angles because it doesn't appeal to everybody\nReally you're ... you cannot get tickets to any of\nYour show yeah well I apparently somebody's coming yeah yeah yeah I I learned it out right yeah\nBut I don't think it's you don't think like you in today they're so used to be when like Johnny Carson could put you on the Tonight Show and you could be famous\nForever and that would make your career if he invited me over to the couch as I mean yeah you're Shandling was is that right now I mean you could do or\nThe United states for the rest of your life and now they're so which HBO Netflix Hulu YouTube to see every there's so much you don't need to be broad ... ... I was at a in Cleveland the there's the theater right across the comedy club and it was sold out there is lying around the block who\nWho's performing you would think like the Beatles yes I Want to like some kid I never heard of yeah no it's it's it's amazing to me as I ... I was amazed the enemy where you don't have to just go\nSee\nIt in comedy is very subjective so you could love someone it'd be like Glenn check this guy out and you could be like not for me yeah right yeah because comedy is Barry ... subject you can't tell them and you can tell him it's not funny right what this guy's funny to me yeah so that's that's what I've what I've experienced so you are with you know\nSo uh you know one of the things that when I when I uh was\nI feel like do they tell you it looked like somebody\nDoes it do you want to do they do know that you know how bad it is somewhere colonel Sanders just like I look like Glenn Beck I don't know [laughter] that was going to go to a different direction I don't know if\nYou heard this before the like the look like Dave Ramsey with hair [laughter]\nDavid actually really good looking man [laughter]\nAll right this is making me a little uncomfortable I have a new world set or the U.S [laughter] I go to a ... and now this isn't helping because I was three I'm going into what's going on what I propose to my wife yeah she said no [laughter] and uh\nAnd ... ... ... what year was a citizen of IDs okay yeah okay [laughter] the rational respond to write the nineteenth alright yeah I'm just trying to get an era right out of the others so she said no and she said the reason why is because\nWe don't have God in common and I said I'm you know I I Believe in God I'm On everything and she said you don't go to church and I said I see you every Sunday after church and every time you come home talking about\nThe people who were honking at each other and yelling yeah they're running the park oh why oh yeah yeah I Know it yeah it's crazy yeah it's crazy how\nPeople are in church and they're finding that but they're like they're looking at their\nWatch it on ... ... ... yeah yeah yeah they won out which of these ... these video mountain road rage and the church parking lot is like I make all these ...\nI make two videos a week and some of them\nConnect and some of them don't just probably like your content of your books sometimes with people like\nYes thank you we needed a sometimes you put your heart and soul into something like yeah you're like what was that one that connected or not that one connected ... yeah 'cause you're I don't think you'd have to be a Christian too or good church going person to you've heard about that mhm from your wife and baby like yeah I Know how it goes and they're like yeah then it's just\nA what's funny is\nThe juxtaposition of ... that you know God first survivors [laughter]\nHow did you lose it twenty steps away\nThe human spirit wouldn't you say like if you like you see someone on T. V. and they're given a run down and you just go\nThat's not right it doesn't seem right that guy's lion mhm you just know because everyone is a human ... like you can spot in sincerity and why that everybody loves that is because everyone when people get mad at my jokes at the live show 'cause you're going to come and the whole crew is going to come to night\nSo the government couldn't get to come and you know yeah yeah well bring up on ... ... people people are like stabbing each other we have a ticket to that's what I that's our goal\nYou're right I mean it's a good ... a comedy show you want a few good yes at the ticket to people\nThe people are like ...\nWhenever I tell a joke it's like a cross the line I go oh stop I I Know you've got a text each other this personally you're young and I know like right when the radio when the lights go off you know like if there's an interview there like come on it would be real this guy\nLike because that's how he generally said on or they don't yeah that's what human [noise]\nAnd I feel like I've connected with you 'cause you're like somebody's like talent somebody's like telling us the truth out here yeah you know what I'm saying and that's what people I think comedy is comedy hard in two thousand Eighteen I go\nI think it's way easier because you don't to to cross the line you don't have to say anything [laughter] right\nMhm it used to be in the nineties you had to say the most profane disgusting I never even I Can't believe this is coming out of someone's mouth but it into does anything we heard everything we've seen everything ... so it's kind of coming back to like a Jimmy Fallon type\nI I I said years ago that I thought the only thing left shocking\nWas what up in individual actually felt yeah that's the only thing left shocking you really are feeling and want to say but you don't\nAs I I Can't believe you said that yeah oh yeah well I have a joke at my act about uh like everyone like we're all good Christians in here we're driving down the road and seen that cyclists on the side throws I Wonder if I just like [laughter]\nLike why is that why does why why it happened and vet\nThat joke has stayed in my show for about four years because it every button yeah because you have what's at the bottom of that you're a ... you want to be the person in church that and then the real human yeah is the guy who all have a dark\nSide yeah ... is the guy now might be something might be better or worse than others some ... some might be against the law and some not bright sunlight\nActually some of the reason why\nThe the reason why the outrage and the culture and people were coming after cabin are because you were like\nIf if if we can notch him down\nI feel like that's why the tabloids exist says what are the outrage exist because you'd think these people are above view the people listening that are ... are like Glenn Beck is up here\nYou know the people listening now okay [laughter] you know they know they're like I'm Better than that [laughter] much better that there was always when everybody started even\nPlaying field and then you get you know that's what you get rich or famous or successful or the c._e._o.\nTo ... you will be down here and him be up here is not sit well with people so if we can somehow\nExpose them as a human and that's what I I've studied my act for a long to every scandal that ever comes out past their politics athlete that headline should be person acts like human mhm\nRight yeah well about ... ... well some of them [laughter] some of them are ... ... oh yeah yeah oh you he was drinking after a long day America yeah\nYeah I got to get that yeah that makes sense yeah or like our he you know is the kind of the thing I don't want to get into politics our guys but on the thing with Kavanaugh was agree or disagree on\nHow well goes or whatever people who said I Can't believe he was angry you where I live\nIn January you can you know there's no human on the planet now that you wouldn't go okay enough\nOkay yeah we were like ... there's and there's no avenue for like defense he now like yeah\nLike people with somebody came after us the ... we have

I don't think it will I think it should it should be doing a ... to here's here's\nAnybody capital allied or for allied anybody they should be held to account\nYeah here's here's the thing I don't care if it is mark judge or if it is a professor Ford right if you lied you should go to jail right that this this is too serious this tour the country apart\nAnd it a little what if this was coordinated if it and I mean Chuck Schumer is well if Chuck Schumer lead to this\nHe should also stand some sort of penalty but anybody who is involved you know there was one guy who or what was it su

five accusers\nYeah yeah this is the Newport Harbor guy yes but look when you get when you get into a situation and and this goes right back to the need to think what we're talking about did you see a list so mulatto yes this week say\nIt doesn't matter if individual men get crushed\nIt doesn't matter because women have been abused for so many years and I have no sympathy for men innocent men who get crushed I mean once you're in that zone and we've discussed this before your interest\nAllen is you are no we don't care\nYou know if some guy didn't do something like ... whoever it may be and and and you get it in your career and family and everything else was destroyed you know that's the price you got to pay because of the past injustices a against women\nBut that is that now that is the ... bill that's the combination\nOf post modernism and social justice social justice now is the vehicle for post modernism and the idea is it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth because others have been in her situation doesn't matter if he did it\nBecause others have been in his situation\nIt what matters is is communal justice\n[noise] that it it is that other people are talking about in
