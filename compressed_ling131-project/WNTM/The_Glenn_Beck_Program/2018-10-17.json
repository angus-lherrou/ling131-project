L. V. laser what do you use that for\nWell we're trying to remove excessive vessels if you have those little vessels on your nose for example on your cheeks someone who's suffering would diffuse redness just new global runs maybe you can't see individual veins that are increasing size but he had this excess redness we can go after that as well and so patients with rose Asia\nYou know of course you know benefit from this laser you know and the thing is\nWe have lasers and they'll try to the laser companies will trust so ... you know ... you know your IP ... dark spots your IP all can treat you know sun damage well we have an idea and the thing that the NFL does well with his son damage is brown spots that's what it does really well with\nBut if you're trying to push the envelope and use the ideology to all these other conditions the patients are gonna get near as good results as if you had the right laser which the ex Sylvia specifically designed to remove read that's was four\nAnd this is this is against something I never thought this is something I didn't know that was possible or people with with veins in the face especially the fact that you've got something like this that can treat them maybe a lot of people that don't even know what can be done\n... of course constantly educating patience and when patients come into the office and they see the information that we have for them now oh you mean you can actually helped me with my ... my doctor a couple of years ago told me there's really nothing to do for that well\nYou know they may not have had a good tool for the certainly may not be something good top ugly to remove a vessel on your nose but no we have a laser that can do that\nAnd ... or ... you have used that on me and it was a a great procedure in that there was zero down time at all at least for me I Know everybody's different but zero down time for me with that and uh as you age you explain to kind of like being part with a rubber band yeah\nAnd uh I mean you know without laser worst case scenario maybe you can have a little bit of bruising that's rare but it's possible may have a little bit of swelling um but in general it's just not a big deal is nine will slow most patients don't know we don't want patients to plan on going you know and getting overheated the day of their procedure on the beat liar that procedure et cetera ride but um\nEverybody's different but a ... but it's it's a great procedure with the ... and you can also use that for ...\nWell smaller veins on the legs we can certainly use you know it has to wavelengths and so for veins on the legs we can use that and we also have\nThe ability to inject bans on eggs now they're large costs nice we generally or for to another provider outside of our organization to take a look at those veins and see if they can do it in the vascular laser procedure so\nA few more lasers to ask about that you use at advanced or mythology and skin care center and that's the luminous laser for hair removal uh that's another thing that a lot of people may not realize that they can ... that you can use a laser for that\nAre typically a ... what do patients want the hair on the back that type of thing [noise]\nWell I'm In you know for men a lot of times it's here on the back that would they won't removed and we you know of course not only is the limits laser probably one of the best of all is on the market but they also have the largest spot size so we don't have really large area like a man's back\nI mean unless you want to do is lay there for an hour plus while someone you know she eats away at your back with a laser right so you know get that done a little bit quicker maybe twenty five minutes\nOr is better for all of us so that's one thing that's very good at you know of course we'll have ladies that come in maybe they have some excess of dark hair the upper lip their chin we can remove that for them you know maybe they have some uh you know here in the bikini area they want removed we certainly do that\nAnd then of course patience legs I mean you know both men and women who want the hair off their legs so you know\nNow is the is the head yes and I've I've had friends of mine that were professional weightlifters that wanted the hair off of their legs and if they know I don't think this was available that when they were in their body building competitions but if they knew they would have been here\nHave swimmers of course they they ah do that kind of thing but look this is a non judgment zone so wherever they want their hair and they were more than happy to do and\nSo when somebody has luminous laser hair removal or is it similar to the experience I had with ... and then it's not that it it really uh nothing short of a a rubber band\nThat's exactly like it is as far as discomfort and of course we're moving into the winter months was a great time to get two or three treatments under their belt generally a treatment every couple of months depending on the area where trading and um you know it's going to take a series to get it going and then we tell patients look you're going to need one treatment a year going forward to keep\nClear after you get the series done\nOkay that was my next question is the hair removal permanent you say about once a year correct [noise] uh let's talk about the mere a dry laser explain how you use that well\nYou know there's a lot of patients out there suffer from excessive underarm sweating\nAnd this is actually I think ... just as big a deal whether it's a male or female I mean you know when you're\nDoing something even if it doesn't make you that anxious and they're just profusely sweating and they're ruining their nice dress shirts are ruining their nice blouses makes them feel more uneasy and uncomfortable and so this is the treatment where we can actually bring a patient in and usually with one treatment\nBasically decrease their sweating by sixty to eighty percent for life as long as they're over about twenty five years old and they're glands are completely developed so and in rare cases I think was a rare over the last four or five years and we've all bad to patients who want to have a second treatment\nAnd even those patients said that about sixty percent improvement\n[noise] this is another thing that a lot of people may not have known was available to them and and we don't need that sweat right\nNow I mean those those lands are about one percent of your total sweat glands so it's not going to affect your ability to thermal regulate\nAt all [noise] now is there any downtime or recovery time from mirror drive\nYou know this will be some swelling for several days afterwards but patients generally can we don't want to do any kind of excessive exercising anything like that was in the first couple of days but after that they're fine they might feel a little bit of swelling little bit of numbness in the in her arm but generally are patients have very few if any side effects with that procedure\nYou've been listening to board certified dermatologist Dr Thomas spender with advanced or mythology and skin care center a forefront

and murder of a journalist I'm Dave Anthony Fox\nNews secretary of state Pompeo has left turkey where he held talks the day after meeting with the Saudi king and crown prince who promised a thorough investigation into what happened at the Saudi conflict on east anvil Fox is Simon on monitoring the latest fly from London\nBecause as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS\nYou know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce\nSo ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so living behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul would absolutely health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS\nHounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true\nWe we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there\nUm and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground you know and and it's it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys were from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that and and the reason for that is because they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into decided they can't run away because it you know they looked like me are white guys read beard and ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so\nYeah so you went from that um to say and I I've got to do\nI've got to keep doing this ... um and that brought you to\nBurma mhm right yes and now you're working with an as rain fun yes in Burma yes and last week talk you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update for us\nYes absolutely so\nAlso to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from ... or ... you were telling me that you were trying to organize a mattress people yes and you were going to bring them all together slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago\nAnd I met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border\nAnd they they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to how the ... marine funds help they know this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist okay I'll all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray that beginning at the end and it's it's it's really really good thing um\n[noise] and so I met with these guys and I explain to them like what we can do and I had already been working in there and done several trips with the ... in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to how this because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the Burma Army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive so\nWhy why are they doing this why are they doing this these\nTribes [noise] it's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic Berman to control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lands they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject or surf class you have to basically serve departments and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus they don't like you 'cause you're Christian\nRight that adds that just as a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know Christians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because we're the ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that\nThe Burma Army attacked them even more\nTell me what you wrote me\nSo I brought I brought with me several photos have somebody I'm over his mercy its best they're apologizing for getting so I brought with me [noise] several photos of of what I see all the time when I go to these places\n[noise]\nAnd these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry\nOf of one particular um attack that happened\nUm this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you had any photos of what's happening and what's going on and in these photos you see dead civilians you see\nKids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage these or intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's a that's a baby\nThat's a baby intentionally kill and the baby didn't die right away I'd survived for about twenty four hours and then died\nAnd this just looks like it's in the woods\nYeah they're out in the jungle these people have nothing and ... still wants to attack them and take more from them and so every time I go there every time the ... shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and I can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the artist for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we save a lot of people's lives\nAnd a villager who had been pushed out of his home by the army him and his family had fled the army and they and they had built they built a a a new hot out in the ... out in the jungle in the middle of nowhere um\nHe he heard that than as rain fun was there and he came and found me and said hey I Want to I Want to I Want to thank you please come to my house for dinner tonight so they gave me on a motorcycle and I drive at this man's house in the middle of nowhere\nWhen I get in there his wife is cooking pigs that for me to eat because that's the big fat and rice and ... and ... leaves and so

tree and he's like this is all we have a snack on while my wife prepares food and he gave me\nTree bark to eat and I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this guy and he has nothing is literally nothing and she wanted to give me ...\nBecause that was the best that he had and so I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark but this man and\nI I was I was so overcome was just like in his gratitude at the level of gratitude he showed for us for that for the mouser infant being there it was it was unbelievable it was so touching and then later on as I was leaving as I was leaving the jungle another man barely speak any English\nUm he's um I'm On a motorcycle and he's driving me out of the jungle and he turned ... as he's driving he turns me he says thank you and I said oh\nLike oh good English

make sure that you grab your tickets or you can do to Glenn Beck dot com slash tour a we're going to see\nIf you can spend as much as a democratic socialist a game show that I don't think you can win no no I think we all lose in the end and you know the\nSad part of the sometimes do Democrats can be very positive for Republicans sometimes democratic candidates are big win for Republicans really and we're seeing a case of this here it appears in Texas\nWhere Beto O'Rourke or Robert Francis or you know as his parents wanted him to be known 'em\nIs going by as he used to call them so called right when it was cool when it when it's beneficial to be called Bobby called himself Bob yeah now he calls himself that All right so Beto is running here in Texas and if you don't have and you\nHaven't seen this you haven't been watching a any national media as far as not just politics I'm playing outside of that Ellen and cold there in Yemen hurry where CNN town hall coming up tonight just him um again it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democratic donor base out of thirty eight million dollars and going to have gone to close races ... you know it all seems like\nCruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we know this could change\nBut well they could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger on JFK\nAnd that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have it I never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or sees me fifty two forty five is the\nIs the margin now with cruise leading by seven points this is from by the way the same company that is hosting the town hall with better tonight CNN their poll thinks you forty five\nI think he wins by twelve\nAnd maybe as high as Eighteen I mean that would be a real surprise uh no it would be but you know when I mean is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe believe the polls here in Texas\nYou know it'd be great if he won he won by three but I I just think that there is this something that ah you know when you get when you when you get right down to it\nTexans are going to say ... to ...\nI tend to think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think I think tens possible though I mean nine or ten is definitely possible um interesting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for ah governor here in Texas\nIs winning by a much larger margin a usually is there I don't have the one I'm right in front of it is it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know there's so much he's up by age Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were Abbott is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll is\nIt the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the other thing that's interesting about it is\nThe um ... you think of it break\nBread country right in Texas ... however are the poll shows the fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance and only forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters words a forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas it this way try this on for size ah a\nDonald Trump is everywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and they're really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh can we talk about today and I don't want to talk about the ...\nYou know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life\nTed Cruz was a very big picture or a big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing

about whatever\nShe had much more I mean she was credible she was okay it's\nJust not gonna happen than not going to get back into it um and they didn't report it when it happened\nArgue why are they then getting into the Monica Lewinsky thing\nBecause they have to at least acknowledge that Hillary Clinton beyond all rationality is that is putting herself out there in these positions where she asked the\nRe litigate this stuff now the reason she's doing it is she wants to remain relevant\nSo she can run again for president [laughter] no I'm Serious come on come on back I'm I'm really you you know that I'm the most brilliant political analysts in the country now I don't I Am\nTelling you that she wants to run again for president and\nTo know I Know she wants to run do you really think she will\nIt depends depends a lot on Biden\nIt depends a lot on um whether she feels that the field against terror is weak which it is absolutely week but the bigger picture is that the Democratic party doesn't know what to do with Bill and Hillary Clinton\nThey don't know what the deal with them\nAll right so Bill Clinton and Hillary going on a road and they were in and talk to their\nDevoted supporters this isn't an accident [noise] this is a is a trial I mean to see how many people show up how enthusiastic they are a below say look when I was president we did all this\nAnd Hillary was a grade a first lady as she did all this and then she was a great senator and she was great secretary's day\nThat's what this is is it ... it up across the country to see how it's gonna fly but if you think Hillary Clinton is just going to go away quietly into the night she's not she wants to be president and she realizes that the Democratic field\nAs it stands now is extremely weak who's going to vote for Elizabeth Warren I mean that a non\nAmerican Idol [laughter] know rushed her yeah it's horrible\nCrushed to the Boston Globe thought it was doing a favor by saying oh yeah we actually got a

candidate in a way\nBelow as in the ... the number one political strategist\nA do you ... how could she come out with\nThis whole thing with Warren without having someone on record\nFrom the Cherokee Nation to support or I mean I she ...\nShe has her grandmother who once told her when she was three [laughter]\nAnd she had high cheekbones and that's because way way way way back um uh she was a chair\nOr as a mother or\nYou know was a source of all of this but look I'm getting back to to backs a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is a ...\nOh yeah All right John shut didn't fit in to the me too movement obviously she doesn't fit in there because she has her husband um\nAnd she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because\nShe didn't receive Scully she's\nYeah she's a system a Paul what they call in New York She's a Paul so but she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game and I talked to Bill Kling about twenty minutes or I mentioned to you last time I was on um she and her husband say you know what\nThey may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than what ... is up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg\nHe was going to run for president of the Democratic ticket and you know outside of New York nobody knows who Bloomberg is very smart guy by the way stream Lee intelligent All right but he doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do a lot of money and he'll be in there\nBut other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy it and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next year\n... and older senior\nCitizen I I Will tell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for running I don't think in twenty twenty ... twenty four\nI don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether Michelle Obama has the drive but certainly she would be formidable and then there's the rock and it's the it's the reverse\nYou know ... they're they\nDon't have the resume I mean the Obamas have you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPretty sure near to the you know I'm not sure you need the ah the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I were to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really doesn't matter anymore\nTo smash that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a different version so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\n... extremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right\nYou might you know this was in her time the next time around you don't want to go up against Trump a certainly doesn't want to do that but it took twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it\nI think the Democratic

press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties the some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past if\nIf somebody stood up let's say you know some group we're standing in the community uh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever\nUm and they followed the king um the rules where you just never swing back\nAh that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties the press played that coverage I don't think
