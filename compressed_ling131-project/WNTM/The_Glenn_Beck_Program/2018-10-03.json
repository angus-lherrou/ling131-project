{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "I mean for a certain situations porches patios a den something simple that sounds great ... those options exist in before we always had to go the other route when a lot of cases it could have been over ...\nNow the sound bar the basic so does sound bar itself isn't that an amazing piece of technology but it just I never would have dreamed that it could sounds so good coming out of that one thing\nIt packs a punch sure sure yeah I'm\nA as night and day uh just listening\nTo your normal TV and turn it on and then if you if you really want the full experience and not totally one hundred percent recommend that you get to add the sub um\nWell ... to another level I Would like to have it I don't have it\n[laughter] I've got it and I know I Would like to uh you know I was the last ones didn't ... I think I may\nGet look at getting ah the one we talked about before it's called a a beam which is a smaller version of what you have yeah because I Do have a traditional system in my family room does still sound really good and I want to keep\nA so maybe in the bedroom it's this much smaller versions so to put that what you have in my bedroom I think would be a bit of to me a bit much now I have another option I did do that yet\nSo it's this intimidating\nI'm always getting told to turn it down [laughter] and I can I can tell and [laughter] even though I Know I can\nControl the ... system on my smartphone and I think it also has a remote although I don't I don't use the remote I can also have Alexa a turning on and off in fact Alexa can turn on and off the television as well right so everything is talking to each other\nAnd it is it's nice to know that these new things hitting the market\nThey're making them compatible with the ... stuff well another thing about it looks if you want us to do it I I don't know if we've talked about\nThat before I didn't\nA newer that just came in front of you had a lecture or not or the Amazon Echo or diet but we can set that up for you to tell us to turn the security off as well so we all I didn't know that ... to just you can say you know elect to turn on you know you can\nAnd so it it's compatible with it\nOkay we're gonna have to look into that too so this is this is just like security in that when you go into somebody's home you you really try to meet their needs you don't go come in with the with one size fits all\nYeah you're exactly right total opposite we it's a blank slate when we walk into someone's home\nThat's when we start we want we want to customize it around their wants and needs and now we can do that within you give us a budget and we can make it we can make it work for you\nEvery day every single day is is honestly a new adventure for us if we've done a hundred jobs not one of those were like the other\nAre now the job you did for me on audio and video was just that one room\nHow many people want you to do an entire house\n... a a a lot uh I mean what are the options there we can take what you have with that so notion we can just get room by room we can customize each room how we want to do it someone says you know I'd like a couple of those sit and above my a cabinet send the kitchen\nOr you know I'd like to sit on the counter or you know what I don't want to see him I Want 'em in the ... so we have a device that Senate snakes that we can run the speakers into so we can just take it room by room customize it at the end of the day they can have an apple like you have and they can have\nFive six seven eight rooms and they can play 'em altogether play him individually play different sources are different you could be playing pain during your kitchen is someone could be in your back porch play in a you know Amazon Music or whatever\nOr so it really has a lot of ah individual control volume control and that's what people want the last thing they want is\nIs to go into a room and be able to play music but they have to run back to the receiver or whatever piece of equipment to change channels a ball game and all those kind of things so that's what makes that experience so nice\nOne of the other things that makes the experience so nice is that the way your installers install so that there is a minimum of any kind of cables are wires or anything like that if it can be hidden it is\nThat's we pride ourselves on the you're totally right um we want to give them a different experience than uh some\nOf the big box stores out there that might have a\nWe don't give you that than just about us and now I mean if you can't if we can give you that go to the store and buy it and just get some my ... handyman to put it in and or or go get it yourself and put it in if you feel like you can do just to get a job so we don't want you to think that way we want to be done with it and we want you to say man you know\nThat would have taken me hours or or I'm Glad they did it I loved the jobs that that's what's so important and gives us we think relevancy and and what we're doing\nYeah it is a the installation is as good as it gets ... with these items that really is now you you um you help me find this television and installed it or you do that also I mean we talked a lot about the audio but you help people if they want TVs as well\nYeah it's part of the a beer and say it's a part of our bundled service it's you know as the TV is uh something we're we do for our customers just kinda is uh almost as it thank you for using us to service\nWe to streamline the service for them make their experience life easier not having to go I'll go home I'll go to best bombastic TVs and meet you over the house you guys are coming at nine well you know\nWeather than do that which TV too we want to look at endless price out that TV if we can keep the price of same or even save your money it's a win win for you because now you don't want to mess with it yeah the margin taken I\nJust kind of we're giving you this is good prizes you get it anywhere else and we're just going to have everything with this and\nMake it a lot sooner rather installation and I'll tell you now there is nothing in the base there is no hardly any margin there's hardly any money and that's for the big box stores as well I mean that's what they a lot of these TVs the the big stores consider their loss leader\nThey'll get you in the store and make hardly anything on the TV but then you end up buying a ten dollar hundred and fifty dollar ac my cable about two hundred dollar TV amount that cost him twenty dollars and now\nThey've made a good margin at the end of the day and they're making it on the the ad on she'd get with that\nWell it it helps of the to get it all through you not only for getting the best price the professional installation\nAnd also the part of the professional installation that looks fantastic but also um\nAh the installer helped me learn how to use all of it that also could take somebody a week or longer to figure out because it's not just one thing everything as as we've talked about is communicating with each other and it helps to have somebody that's that's installed it in those all of it to go over with you\nWho you brought up a good point and if I can say this real quick so as a lot of things became wireless ... in some things that customers could install I was scared that\nYou know years ago and thinking man you know is this going to be kind of it just out of the business here I mean you know as this technology changes what I've found is were needed more than we ever have ever been needed because we it has to do some serious technical programming a\nMaking all these things work were needed more now than\nThan ever it's such a such as the need has changed dramatically so my thinking was was wrong\nWay ... well and

with the rest of humanity\nI Do not believe the victim\nI Will take seriously the account of the accuser then I Will look at the facts if there was a preponderance of evidence then I Will presume that person either innocent or guilty\nBut after I've seen facts is this kind of stuff was going on this should all be in the court of law\nIf you are a victim\nSociety will do nothing for you because we cannot do anything for you if you haven't gone to the police and reported it\nIf you believe that we live in a rape culture then you have a responsibility to go to the police and document everything that has been done\nThen we as a society need to do everything we can to make sure that justice is served not on a collective basis but judging it by the individual case\nThat is a just society that is America\n[noise]\nWednesday until we're hearing here listening and then going back program one\nOf my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds it Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gay but it was an interview in fact where he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go\nAnd then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and Eric Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just\nSays it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and ah and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... or and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and make money or they have a certain ... world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did in which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGland they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seeing that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... Stein or have science a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and there's a very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they're getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yes it's a verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed\nRight that's like going to a dictionary that will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's real problems\nYou're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly well because it's occurring right real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was linked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about ...\nAbout these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive if you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah\nI'm going to put my fake news story the pointed this out in the open you have combat and by the way the news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news add that the Russians ran of\nJesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you voted different wet I wasn't but that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter] but you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias\nYou know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right why we'll you'd I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent\nYes and it's not very good\nAt it is not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line the ... dot com Peter ... with it and we have a lot to discuss because of the plant forming\nA and kind of a role in from our last conversation about information out of you know that it's true and we'll prove

and it comes from a a quote from the guy who's\nRunning Google that you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line that's terrifying beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I wanted I Want to talk to you about the platform me I Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice\nLet's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or any but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies\nAre are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing here yeah and I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first to consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine\nGoogle actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning they blacklisted the entire Internet that shows you the ... the scope and size that Google ... wait a minute we it's it's a ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW\nYes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous\nAnd a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using a Google product somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but is your company ... you know it may be John Smith at acme incorporated dot com but his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product\nBecause if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing\nAnd it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example\nRobert apps signed this caller who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a harbor PHD in psychology um Iran uh did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this was back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech if you have on general or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of those emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves they view themselves as a company with a mission\nSo here's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually\nYou are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research so Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product yeah we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of look there's that this is just at the beginning let me tell you is boogie story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay\nThe center is the main city of aging how many people it used to look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they

interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office I witnessed Dr Ford help McLean prepare for a potential polygraph exam\nDr Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraphs work and help to McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nLet me play this audio again of what she said under oath\nHave you ever had discussions with anyone ... attorneys anyone how to take

to somebody who is looking to take a polygraph test anyone never never\nNever well we know somebody's lying here\nWe know we know someone is lying right do we still because we have somebody we have somebody who has accused her of teaching someone else\nAbout a polygraph\nWell she's innocent until proven accused I think that's important that we keep it either she now that you moved acute she is accused she's guilty so if we're going to use the same standard that the left is applying she is a lawyer\nShe has perjured herself\nCertainly shouldn't be a professor anymore she should not be a different sense even be allowed to work at a fast food restaurant I don't think so how can you how can you possibly believe a liar on anything she says\nYou want this standard because this is the standard that's coming this is the standard\nThat we are now running to embrace this is the standard that our children this is the standard that we ran from this is why we're America because in every other country this was a new idea\nYou can always come into my house and just take me you can't just throw me in jail you have to have an accuser I have to know what the charges are\nI have a right to defend myself I have a right to know who my accuser is and dress my accuser\nI have a right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty [noise] this is what America was founded on is this is an a uniquely American idea\nThis was the genius of our founders you want to flush it away\nGo ahead [noise] but I Will not be part of it this is the American idea\nNow listen it is\nSo imperative that you understand what this is if you do not understand what you're fighting do you think we could have won World War two\nWithout naming the Nazis\n[noise] do you think we will ever win this war on terror with out naming what it is about what is driving people to the terror\nV. is laments ideas not Muslim ideas Islam is ideas that sure real law is the prevailing law and if you are not under surreal law you were an infidel which means I can kill you I can rape you I can turn you into a slave\nThat is\nWhat the war on terror is all about\nAnd we will never win it unless we name our enemy\nWe would have never won World War two if we were fighting the Germans we we're not fighting the Germans we were fighting the Nazis\nWe would not have one in ... in the civil war had we been fighting the south\nWe were fighting people who didn't believe in the constitution we were fighting for the freedom\nOf all men that's why we won and by the way if you don't think that's true we lost every single battle up until the point\nThat Abraham Lincoln said this is about slavery\nLook it up\nWe wouldn't have won the the American Revolution if it wasn't against tyranny it wasn't against the king it was against tyranny and it was for certain ideas like the idea\nThat you were innocent until proven guilty\n\nWe are fighting post modernism and until the American people understand what post modern ism is you will lose\nYou will lose every battle because you will only grow frustrated and angry\nWhich will play directly into what they want to happen they want us at each other's throats they want us to be irrational they want us to be angry they want us to just to start swinging and blind rage\nThat's their plan\nAnd until you understand what they're doing until you will understand that this isn't really about Ford this isn't about the charges\nThis isn't about anything this is all about the patriarchy this is all about white men have put together in this case a rape culture and they have kept people\nDown and it doesn't matter if he really did it because other white men have it doesn't matter if she was really a victim because other women\nHave been victims this is about collective justice\nCurrently entitled social justice but make no mistake this is collective justice\nAnd collective justice\nTo put it into the terms that are Christian will understand is anti Christ\nCollective salvation is anti Christ collective justice is anti Christ individual salvation individual justice\nThat is Christian\nYou cannot balance the scales\nBike convicting someone who is not guilty because someone who looks like them\nHas done it anyway\n\nI don't think America understands and I think you feel it I think you feel it I don't know if your neighbors do but I think you feel it we are extraordinarily close to the edge of the abyss\n\nAnd I am doing what I promised I Would do I promised when it come when it came to that time and I asked you to do the same I Would

what\nWas it and I don't know where's the house\nNotice that people are not laughing they are smiling and they are cheering but they are not laughing he's not meaning this is a joke he is instead stating the facts and the absurdity of this case\nAnd people are cheering because finally someone is saying it in his case to give President Trump\nBonus points here he's saying things that I don't think any other president would have the balls to do at least no other Republican president bronco Obama would have done this but only only Brock Obama in ... if ... you know in the last recent memory

know like the ... parade is a different time okay\nSo ah he's not mocking he is stating the facts\nThat's what's happening now Trump mocked the victim ... stew I've got a few words for you to look up that I think America needs a refresher course on could you look up victim ... huh\nI mean the DNA that's definitely one of the word victim Glenn victims and down by the way we should point out that

as an observation here Glenn on the victim is if you call her a victim you are condemning his guilt\nOh you have already decided the case if you call her a victim when you are in a headline for example and you say he ... a mock victim\nWhat you're saying is Brett Kavanaugh Kevin always guilty correct so you're saying it without having to say what's your say what you should say instead could you look up the word accuser\nAccuser yes here okay ah accuser accuser a person who claims\nOh wait this is starting to sound accurate it is a person who claims that someone has committed in a fence or done something wrong okay so in at all sure either her\nAn accuser so he wasn't mocking he was stating the facts of the trial\nOr the or the hearing\nAnd a A N\nCondensing the ridiculous ... of the

I mean even for thinking this even just for comparison\nYou can't if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed our war huh well I Want to see what it was like when they originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and the and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer did will have a local copy stored on their computer or their device\nUm and and this is a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally when these services are often trying to\nEncourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own set of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm with the Apple TV for example\nAt the Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of the movie to access it through their ... servers\nExactly I'm\nSorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded a something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kendall\n\nSo that allows you to store those files locally on your own device\nBut cars that Kendall is tethered through software right where connections to Amazon Amazon has the ability as as a show ten years ago to block it move those files strong\nMuslim affable you talking about all go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years ago chewing it a different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way they've forced everybody to have it exactly\n[laughter] it's bizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce\nThere is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making for my tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\nYou it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they are constantly knowing what you do with that product and you have that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk about a little bit about the change their cars that is a that's a real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break\nAnd then we'll come back and get you to answer that question a and just the\nChange in him capitalism change what does it mean to enter a world where\nThere's really no ownership of anything\nFor four years now relief factor has been helping uh my team here in the studio\nAlleviate pain late last year um oh school mine well I Want to tell you about really factor really factor take it it's really good [laughter]\nI'm married and you can buy really factor with gold one thing you can I don't think you can well okay so I Want to tell you a little bit about the goal line the new silver maple flex allows you to break off a smaller pieces a for a barter Andrade of sub silver\nUm there's a really I mean we just talked about the debt\nI don't know what's going to happen to the dollar nobody does nobody does nobody knows what's gonna happen bitcoin what's it going I mean there is if there ever is a time of of catastrophic change there's going to be a time when we're all going to have to kind of worked together and figure things out or because of the things aren't going to work the same with with dollars\nMay I suggest that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a they have the maple flex going which is this this bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it around it has a maximum flexibility you just break off pieces and\nAre you going to have you know one tenth one quarter of an ounce of silver\nBut they also do it in gold and its own made by the royal Canadian meant the only people that carry this is gold mine\nJust look at the numbers find out for yourself is the world hurtling towards\nA fiscal sanity or insanity\nAs soon as the stars start rolling the other direction I'll stop talking about this but I don't trust that we have anything that's going to go into um bring us back into sanity other than
