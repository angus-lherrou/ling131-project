Mikhail\nThe Gulf Eli Japan's on us checking off and for the latest news radio seven ... when you went ... and I are it's radio station a nine point nine W ... three mobile\n[noise]\nTrump has been briefed by a secretary of state I'm Dave Anthony Fox News\nThere are lots of stories out there about what has happened my\nBumper moments ago talking about the presumed murder of a Saudi journalist in Turkey\nWe just aren't going to allow the process to move forward [noise] a lot of facts to unfold\nWell do you how did he lie what do you lie about he said he drink to excess from time to time yep what are you lie about\nThe idea is that we're all other because other people around them are like well I think he did he people did blackout how the hell do you know not oh he would know that right or maybe he did I I don't see how that's all that uh\nThere's no way to know that into the conversation but the bill and there's no way to know what if the ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this\nIs the\nAccusation that everyone who supported Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person even from people like you know there are people in the left that you know I'm sure\nThe restaurant I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford ... ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they're saying which is they accuse us of believing\nForward\nIn around about sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want him on the Supreme Court right and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accuse me of a bowl of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I I think I don't think it happened\nYeah known either if it hadn't been I think it happened with somebody else\nMaybe believing that is so is this is a I don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't fair but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official\nOr in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades then talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party like\nWater we and the person who's making the accusation has an overt\nUh dislike for the\nParty of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist is march that women's march rallies as as an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in that motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost it's like it's going to sound bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor that indicates that this uh this events occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would ever called the victim I called them survivor but ... when I when they leave I Am\n... survived this assault by this man if they've assault didn't happened they didn't survive and [laughter] yeah I guess we could all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so far life yeah look I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible what you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence she make it up\nWhy would she lie about it that's a good question because I Love this one mhm possibly come on your motivation [laughter]\nWhether that gives you should like this I don't know when I tell her to go we talk about uh yeah I Know we\nTalk about the the women's right to choose it is to fend did as if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one\nI wouldn't defend my children's lives about as strongly as they would they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so\nVital is insane we've seen them foreign crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week and we're five five accusers accused the high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't like him\nYeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle on receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against the being anti gay\nThis happens all the time you know why people are horrible many of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things that you can explain it happens all the time\nAnd the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing the swastikas on their door for nothing you know to like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused we may do we know for a fact the fifth accuser recounted his allegations after he made them\nWe know the the fourth accuser didn't even bother right any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or what had happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seemed ... the seem credible to even Democrats\nWere the first two and in the second one is the is that there's a ... their right they went they the person who made the allegation said I I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate the person and that person said\nNo it didn't happen and she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember to even happen exactly\nIs the old act on Sunday ... operating evidence on that one either and there was and look the Fort one was only ... I think taken more seriously than the others because there was an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people if there was no evidence proving that had happened here um and then of course obviously people like have it on his uh his uh what is worse thing now um but\nThat one was serious because she went and just you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing\nRelatively credible job it recounting what she believed the story was who knows if it was true or if it was completely felt false the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation\nAgainst someone but it's completely false\nIt's just an eight yeah of course you can do it I mean but as we heard with Hillary Clinton she said they were they vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this but they\nThe the media access if this is entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter] I Know of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five days and then probably in all of them\nAnd ... you brought up the high school situation in California where they call it the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accused is one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nUh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault\nOr and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk I don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him take credit I didn't like him\nReally encourage or how about the Ohio University student who ah got threatening notes about how they didn't want her in her elegy peachy lifestyle to them to be in the students' Senate anymore at Ohio University\nUh she was a angry and frustrated and disappointed she said I'm a shoe you may find my me revolting unworthy of a threat of my life but in reality it's your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head you F ing a whole I Am proud to be who I Am and nothing could say or do you ever change that\nBy the way the ... of course admitted to sending the threats to herself\n... or or the woman and why would you do that yeah why what could her motivation possibly be it's hard to to in this case it's not hard to detect with Brett Kavanaugh\nOr a the a woman in Texas who said a state trooper sexually assaulted her until of course the camera footage came out and her own attorney had to say we're sorry for bringing this case we didn't know about this at the time\nOr the charges against the for dentist accused in Las Vegas of raping a ... a people and that was also found to be completely false and untrue or\nAnd what he found out it was an air soft gun and now he's not you know this story you know ... cause I mean it let's just say you had a realistic looking air soft gun ... that media lost it a little are you I assume they all have the orange thing on the end yes just ... you know let's just say that fell off or something or you can eat it at blackberry what'd you say\nHe's walking down the street or he's walking towards the school I can understand someone passing by me like a what the hell's going on and sharing the police yeah\nAnd what happens if they show up and they talk to them they owe generic ... are getting at the orange piece of people are gonna freak out and then you release them right let's say a max the maximum penalty but we will look we're going to take the gun will return it to you later\nInstead they found the ... gun in his truck and arrested him for disturbing the did they realize it was an air south yeah they knew what was in ... they said it was an air soft gun and they're they're still\nBeing congratulated for their sweeps accent [laughter] I Hope that I don't know\nI don't know what are you going to do with an ... I mean if you shot somebody in the eyes yeah you're supposed to work goggles right when you're wearing yeah that would hurt a you might put an eye out my mom warns me more than me about that a word that was a kid\nUm but other than that\nI I don't know what you're going to do with yourself gun that's so dangerous that they had their arrest the kid when they found out it's an ...\nBut he wasn't even walking down the street he posted a photo you didn't on right now buddy didn't didn't say I'm going to use this at school and none of that\nVery bizarre [noise] Mm\nFollow us on Facebook followed ... news radio seven ten Donald un P.

I think he just he contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff\nMember of the Washington Post columnist wasn't any or he'd written it's relatively new yeah because he had left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness what's going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new\nAnd you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... a first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean an important that we are able to air those things\nAre but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was a feeling he's made like he's tried to capitalize on that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one the biggest political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like fifty years ago and he's all out and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven\nUm right so this is not a new accusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about for like ...\nOur allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Iraq Obama was plenty friendly with them to\nExactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there was no way the bronco Obama would've done anything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point no longer and it wouldn't have done anything about this it's a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the media coverage\nToday the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker\nWho is expensive right I mean remember good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again the big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the\nRoom remembered this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as the bad guy who who was who's incompetent Brock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nAnd it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years since the lower than me so it was a decision made sense Charlotte Charlotte me\nTo go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision in in the minds of people who want to praise to the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking admission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military member especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean it you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options in and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nNow that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on let's investigate this before we act irrationally\nIf for uncle bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something\nIt's just the you know the the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely absurd fast with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who's a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's brought about by or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the board and and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this was a man who was murdered\nA potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your bones up something happened there ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't fair and more of a story here maybe that's the story run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still and I'd be age yeah should be\nUm breaking news now\nUm Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nAre actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ...\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them because they just paid us a hundred million dollars\nOf course there are always paying a hundred million dollars or a relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that kind of I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there there are these considerations and that is why when you're making\nA decision as the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term I'm\nBy a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority\nTop priority is not a Jew ... murders in Turkey\nRight like the you know I don't know if anybody knows this but we're ... we a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore so studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things all over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a columnist\nIs a big part of the reason why a you know I think the media care so much about it and they're prioritizing it over you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like it's this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up working for an American newspaper\nSo it is a big story and the and the details rounded are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why it captures the interest but being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative\nAnd there's a lot at stake here a lot at stake I mean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they're going to retaliate and if it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in\nThe oil that's what they've already threatened All right go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply well I think we get scanned little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got all your\nA cheese crossed in ... before you take\nThat happens you know there's three times last week alone for me and it was fifty some

self\nYes shouldn't ... out of that situation she's also quite annoyed by the Little Mermaid she's banned that as well she says the songs are great but they don't give but don't give your voice up for a man or a man thank you ... there's a lot of women are doing that today\nThe main message modeled on a ... of really the entire movie a is to give up all of your rights to men and wait for them to rescue a ... especially a rash of rich guy\nThat's the message you should be taking from those movies I'm\nChristian bell is also fearful that Disney Princess as are sending the wrong message to her

a a a print a date with a magical spell right on the princess yeah and she's sleeping because she can't wake up right unless the prince kisses her that's kind of the premise that yeah\nSo it's a it's

possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was definitely part of her

moment about what we were trying to find that Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people\nSay that they remember this this incident uh she didn't\nTell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what had happened what mine of it it happened right none of it right [noise]\nUm and we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one of the witnesses she named instead came out and\nYeah I remember that party I remember hearing ... really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like you know very distant and I I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in\nI mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on for something like that just one person saying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident which just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party a Kurd none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from\nSlate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape not sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to go down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was saying like perjury charges or something against or\nFive people said ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred wow so now while for one person who was at the hotel or at the party and the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred\nOr a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn pantyhose in their shared hotel room broader explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband then her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rate that the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe ... and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked a rapist like by the way I'm going to renovate the president over there a dark\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended\nNewspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was a prison outside the hotel window wow that is a\nThousand times the amount of even alleged evidence that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet that was ignored\nFor ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats\nAnd now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after they never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again to them\nHillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump\nAnd that's why they have no more used for them\nBut I mean Bill Clinton goes wrong is still makes a big level speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there it's it's the situation with with a double standard that is so bizarre\nAnd the fact that they that that the media actually thinks we should take in their ... current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when you report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system\nWith actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened I mean\nThat is well that's the system we have it's the best in the world and the idea that we are now supposed to go through these kinds of records and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it\nIs now or standard that isn't sanity it's insanity\nAnd yet you have Hillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is some ... can show evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated a reception of Michael\n... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy their so pissed off about that and they do not want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point but what a clown he is he is yeah\nIt's it's

you want to know what happened\nFor solving given\n[noise]\nYou're listening to Glenn Beck around with guns do Tripoli Seventy Seventy ... or there's this there's\nAn interesting thing from the New York times today and it is they do this little podcast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm well he did things in front of girls right after you ask them if you could yeah and that and they said yes at odd part of the saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alley that much if any allegations of him doing something\nThat against the motives will write like he would ask they say yes\nOr or um there was one case where\nUm he\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure and himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics power dynamic absolutely yeah power to marry makes you do all sorts of because as a comedian he's in ... he wields incredible how right in this country now incredibly limited to ever\nFired at any job in the nation are you in any job you're a sarcasm is just reality in a situation\nThat they're going to go and what they were saying they're saying they ... some\nPeople were other comedians and you want at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there is something invited her back to his trailer to do its thing in front of her which apparently was 'cause this is his shtick\nAnd and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it in force her to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation ... learn to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously ... right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I I have a issues I'm Sorry\nSay that is is that sexual assault and the accusation there I Know that he was shown what she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right man he admitted in such a general way that people kind of a make it easier well he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make them right and I think\nThat the one I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's evidence\nThat he did this to anyone\nSo it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again just making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was the folks who scares away from right you're not supposed to just as the other and people will commit crimes in the future and listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is\nFamous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedians I never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks in it as a ... or Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while because that are loose okay well I'm In a doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he's bounced around just several clubs around New York since and they let him on stage so the New York times there's an exhaustive report about trying to talk to the club owner but why you let him on stage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision listen\nAll the people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy and he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like\nNever mhm might never say never\nWell can you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence never work again he says I don't care never this is an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the owner of a place where you would say\nParticularly to a female customer who is somebody that's on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton was credibly obviously accuse in Juanita broader I mean I think nobody will expect a
