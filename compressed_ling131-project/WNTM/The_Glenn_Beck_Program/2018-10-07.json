any good\nI invite you to check out our Web site that Jesus Christ show dot com find out about our cup club all that stuff to check out the Jesus Christ show dot com or that last call\n'em brings up a lot of thoughts about family and connection and I know that\nI'm a life is built on relationships it really is and I've said many many times that scripture\nIs all about relationships uh-huh it doesn't seem and that's not to be some new waging modern thought of wiggling everything down to relationships it's the truth if you go through the beginning uh an Adam and Eve to the book of revelation\nIt's all about the interaction with one another and interaction with God\nAnd getting\nTo the the focus is to the center of relationships is the key to everything in life are breathing\nYour job your well being ah your home the peace at home all of those things really center on\nHow you interact with others and can relate\nAnd that means by relating I means not only are you know if you think one sided late that you deal well with relationships that's not a relationship\nIf you understand people take time to understand them and in a case of being a parent and leaving money to your children are putting in it and we will I Know that there's a lot of factors that you're thinking about I'm dealing with\nUm well this person took care of me or this person took time with me but there's also things that you have to think about when you're gone and the relationship that that leaves 'em the rest of the family members in in the siblings and how that could build\nRivalry or a book that rivalry or a interaction cause problems in the interaction of those those siblings\nAnd so your relationships never stop isn't that fascinating that even when someone passes on\nThat really the spirit of what they bring to that family unit or whatever continues to be a part of that family and often times there are um parents that ms treated children or a favorite one or did something\nThat that continues to to last how many times have we had a phone calls on this very program of people calling in and saying something happened a long time ago that parents are even past instill permeates\nOr has a driving force\nIn relationships to this very day\nSo obviously relationships are incredibly important and sometimes people get wrapped up in the fact that their their chemical or chemistry or you connect with this person or a don't connect with that person but ultimately\nLearning how to deal with other people learning how to understand other people's needs and and uh who they are as a person is part of communicating and part of having relationships\nYou need to take time\nTo understand and to learn about those people as well and I encourage you to do that in all walks of life family friends everything and I know that there's a lot of noise out there these days and a lot going on in the world but I Want you to remember the simple words I Am with you always

charges are upsetting a and and uh they're obviously they triggered an entire a national conversation about sexual assault and sexual harassment about the unequal way or the women and girls are created in this country at the same time there is as of now no contemporaneous corroborating evidence\nFor any of the charges as far as we know we haven't seen anybody emerging say yes I remember that and that is an important part of the story as well\nThat is not just an important part of the story that is the story\nThat is the story and I for one\nI for one we'll not condemn Ford and I will not condemn a a Brett Kavanaugh I wasn't there I'm not God there is no evidence they need to vote to confirm and we need to stop the witch hunts [noise]\nNeither listening to blame that so [noise]\nIn my book addicted outrage um there are lots of examples of\nOf why we should really be talking about something entirely different why we should be talking about how do we make how do we strengthen this\nAnd spread this around the world\nRight now are dialogue is America's sucks nothing is good everything is bad and that is absolutely not true\nIn the middle chapter of the the book I I ask this question\nIs this worth saving\nNobody is asking this we're talking about getting rid of capitalism changing our whole system changing everything about it it doesn't work no one is asking the question that must be asked first is this worth saving is America and the west good or bad\nIt can be both because people are both but is it\nOn the on the whole has it helped more people or hurt more people\nWere not having that conversation we are having it now\nArthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the Seattle area um he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think it's the first time I really saw poverty as well I think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson a\nFund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we had never seen anything like that\nThat was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good viewing month how're you doing\nI'm I'm I Am great I'm great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not talk about\nWhat capitalism are and what this country has has done what the western way of life has done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window and you make compelling case because you didn't commit this with politics in mind\nYou know I don't you know and and a lot of the things that we are talking about today I was listening to the last segment of your great show and and you you're talking about this big war this big cultural battle that we're having those countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about\nThe Trump Administration or about capitalism and general these are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having in in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot [noise]\nUm you've done humans work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we're so unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean\nYou're going to have ... if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it\nAnd listen to people saying the most violent ghastly things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knocking the night it was going to be no jak booted thug nobody's going to take you off to prison and God Bless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having the dome proxy wars that's completely unproductive\nSo ... right now I ... you know the big ideas are being trashed the ideas of\nFreedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense yeah but also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back in the eighties of those starving Ethiopians\nIt bothered you and you actually that that set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives of most of my [noise] my my left wing friends or family that I care about poverty and ... and I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening to us when the leaves\nAnd and that their their obligation infect their privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world what really matters is what works what system works full you sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters and I found that there was one system of pulled people up to billions all around the world these are big issues that we need to be talking about in America today and how we can do this better\nThan you give me some of the stats Arthur I Know you I don't know if you have him off the top of your head\nTo toe absolute or so from Nineteen Seventy\nAnd killed today you know when when you and I were really little kid um that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on it was really in the seventies but people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old in Nineteen eighty three is starving children\nAnd it was ghastly from Nineteen Seventy until two eighty percent of the world's poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been eradicated no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nLike front page and the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not a news story you only see the things that are going wrong\nBut the truth is that ... billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of starvation in poverty Glenn since you and our kids and there was one thing that did that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me Arthur um that we are not using the first task of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we uh we have\nWe think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter you know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it as Adam Smith lines out it it can produce really bad things as well\nCapitalism depends on the people who are ... are wielding it but also uh depends on on what our goals are\nSlow and it's got up to now would you agree with that\nYeah that's well that's the problem is is not capitalism a lot of what we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff is going on with powerful people in Washington DC and in every state Capitol around the country\nThat's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people [laughter] so so competition is good competition politics and economics and the competition of ideas factor that you know the ... the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a friend democratic nation is very very important [noise]\nAnybody wants to shut down competition on behalf of powerful people\nIs not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy and doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas to compete means to do it better than the other guy barely peacefully and respectfully and to win over an audience and ... that's really what we ought to be doing and that's what we're moving away from\nOkay so Arthur I'm gonna take a quick break and I want to come back with the question that I cannot find a satisfactory answer on I Am a big believer in capitalism however\nThere it throughout history some people like Vanderbilt et cetera et cetera they get so much money they have so much power that they are controlling things and it it just seems to spiral out of control when you have\nYou know a just a lock on this wealth and we are creating people through Google et cetera et cetera that are doing the same thing how do you balance the power how do you\nHow do you make sure who's who can compete against Google how are you going to do that how does that work when you get to that point to that like to hear your answer on that when we come back [noise]\nClan\nYou know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there's a system of preferences for legacies [laughter] you know if you went to university so you know four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying you got into the lucky genetics club\nYou know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience so so that's actually what we need to be thinking about don't worry about Google were a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't try is today that's that's really an American thing\nAnd why can't they rise that can't rise because we have a discriminatory system of unequal education were poor kids are walked into public education systems their parents don't have choices number one number two\nIs we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers [laughter] we don't have a vocational and technical education systems which are the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country and most importantly glad we don't culturally value\nThe skills that come from actually not going to college where people actually work skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did The Apprentice system go away\n[noise] but went away for a bunch of different reasons but part of it had to do with the fact\nThat you know back in the Nineteen on until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America where white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades\nAnd and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater white kids black kids every kind of kids should have the opportunity to succeed through hard work and skills and put holiday should have without going to college\nAmazing or there but it is that the early I think of apprenticeships that I think you know you're going back to\nCharles Dickens times since we've seen it it's amazing that those that really disappeared in the sixties and seventies\nWith more

Glenn\nBeck dot com slash tour okay back with a Arthur C Brooks he's the president of the American Enterprise Institute\nArthur though the ... who is we're talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics it was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it\nOn both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is is a rational human being is like this is this is not good and none of this is good um\nYeah however ... ... we're not having\nAny one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has gone awry because we've deep ... you know unpaid from that\nCapitalism is is got a horrible name you now have fifty percent of young voters saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden isn't\nIt isn't and and by the way there are some people standing up for the bill of rights by constitution guys like Glenn Beck and when you got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and ... and good the big problem as there are too many people in the media and politics and entertainment in our polls campuses\nOn the right and the left or orchard dining out on the fact that we have a culture of contempt in this country contempt for each other\nI mean Glen you and I we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politic\nWay out fine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and and people that we love we just have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have to hate him and there are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful by trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talked about the things that really bring us together\nAnd then try to disagree in a way that the competition can actually\nConvince other people persuade other people of our ideas but that's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich\nBy by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I say capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nYeah I Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time their way not to take that on his by trying to create liberal tears that's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive and to say that their belief system is stupid that will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing\nTo do because these are your brothers and sisters as well the key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective a moral objection to the people\nIs to is to give voice to the fact that\nYou you want these social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right\nAnd get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship because it was lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history\nIt's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody has ever thought of in the history of humanity and say and now the problem is not that this is an equal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives sold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden can you describe what that is\nWould have to recognize that we don't have to agree\nIt's okay in this country to have actual disagreement that's the basis of our excellent your message has always been so good pled because you don't hate anybody and we have to as leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our

bluffing at the table I've got this they fold they don't want to fight they're not willing to fight\nDonald Trump allowed this to happen and Kevin I would've been completely discredited I think under any other president he would have just gone away discredited because they would have said you know what it's not worth it we don't believe those charges and he would have had no platform to defend

should be used to it by now but um you know why that's why people voted for him yeah for for this very reason he's willing to ... he's willing to stand and make this fight because he believes in it\nBut then it's ... it's just nothing I really didn't think he had it in it yeah you know we've talked about it before\nYou've got to admit when you're wrong and here's another case of me being

that all conservatives are rabbit about guy somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a ...\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with them but no I was willing to die in a sword for em em remember remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he asked them later I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next the nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy you know that that's the thing to do because then you have them battling just on abortion right there at the same place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt conservatives getting to the polls\nIf if you put a staunch conservative somebody who says yeah I think abortion is wrong and if it comes before me I'll look at the case of course but I think it's wrong I think it's murder\nAnd ... and ... versus Wade was a terrible decision you then have\nRepublicans running to the polls and you'll also have Democrats but I think that your

Glenn Beck command All right we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Kevin ... which again I'm\nSo we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know she gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial\nRapist Oh thank you that's up in the area important it's so important is very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold the role\nThat relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge or or ah or I'm a attorney general general attorney general would raise a good one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's just a certain candidate\nWho's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman or he was dating now there is an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this ... business separation between the capital case in the case of the cabinet tastes happens or thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay\nAll right so there's a difference but that's one difference ... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nIssued a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know never remember with Ford we have no even sense that there was a relationship of any sort of between ... and Kevin ... we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that when we got both of those so there are a little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course well yeah well in their words case they both\nHave a note from there do they get around those cases are the the Ford case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which he referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling that would never named Kevin ...\nThe notes from uh the uh Alison teeth Alison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might know it's a slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes or that do to ... actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is\nI'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll usually leading me yeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not um being forced she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with the of course I'm a Ford F ... name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it\nHappening then people forward named\nSay that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of those that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nA key that within a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down\nI don't I'm including things like tax I'm writing um the pictures\nAnd are those are things that she showed two co workers in real time real\nTime and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that Ford told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like you have an a or said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but ... and I mean you I mean you don't have video tape ... tape\nNow we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the bail us with a friend and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence in fact I don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the four case so we I mean like we haven't seen him out more we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alison case\nAnd only five percent of people believe her the the platitudes you hear from the media and the left I mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether Ford was abused or not they don't [noise]\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard\nIs

Stein a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\n... one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very uh you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it's secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results and the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\n... is a Google is a verb but now I'm not a noun verb\nAuto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary that will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yeah that's real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly what because it's occurring right real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this so it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about\nUh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineer's saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put my fake news story appointees it's out in the open you have combat and by the way have fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton\nThat fake news to add that the Russians ran of Jesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince\nYes yes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just\nGoogle the company a lot of people don't realize this I didn't realize this if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information um if you're using if you are using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple\nNine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nTo be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information and want to dominate the space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um what can be done um with the algorithm or I'm concerned about some things that I think are really dangerous and the platform ing and be racing voices right because Google thinks\nThat says you know that's that's not right that's eight speech we'll get to that when we come back [noise]\nWere mobiles days and that didn't use radio seven ten W when GM\n\nWants to end underpaid time we knew it\nWe're here to change that we can't do any one thousand dollars [laughter] when one thousand dollars every hour radio seven ten WNBA ... de\nDe jour for your dinner and when I feel I mean\nYou could make it rained in front of your least favorite co workers driven by mobile bay Harley Davidson new ownership new attitude the Gulf Coast premier spot for all things Harley Davidson is where you could get a new army for as low as one oh nine month find their events on Facebook there's always a party at\n...
