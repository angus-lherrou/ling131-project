yeah we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know she gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you that's up in the area important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold a role\nThat relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge or or ah or I'm a attorney general general attorney general would raise one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up ... because there's cause for certain candidate\nA who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nA by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this ... there's a separation between the cabinet occasionally I was a case\nOf the cabinet case happens or thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's one difference on a professor Ford she had a spotty memory issued a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even\nSense that there was a relationship of any sort between ... and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that I got both of those so there are a little do you remember where they happen you know she does remember when they happen okay does\nWhat did she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\nWell yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from there do they do around those cases are the ... the forward case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison teeth Allison's I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries um and that kind of a difference to you might you might know it's a slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you those using meeting\nMe yeah and she and you know and in one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being forward shift and have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with the of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening the people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them said I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nA key those in a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've\nSeen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax um ratings um pictures\nAnd there are those are things that she showed two co workers in real time real\nTime and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had to Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but ... lives and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well it\nWas you know tape now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exists some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the cabinet thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing that we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the ... and we don't have that evidence yeah I mean we have a a a ton of evidence\nAnd in fact I

room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like\nWell what it what it does say when he does\nIs that it plays into a larger picture up this man he was in his anger when he was drinking and this shows the he's capable of doing these things\nSo if I Know what I'm saying even reached further I Know if he would've come on and he would not have been angry\nI would've thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like the anger\nI Want you to hear me clearly\nI did not have sexual relations with that one game thing yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful as\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the

done she served her purpose she bought time they used her as a pivot\nTo something new okay so there there\nThere's nothing new there there is nothing new or the press would be saying well you you watch what's going to come out this FBI they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out and said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was and I wasn't going to say anything but I Know\nThat that happened none of that is happening what is happening\nIs people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury you watch that's by the end of the week that's what they will be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump the only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way you have\nTo have a plan and announce it in the same press conference that you say\nYou know he he you know quit or vote went down all went down in ... or an down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference\nYou must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election now the only in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely because you don't need how long did they do take to do to the ... sessions\nAh ah ah I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February eighty was the boat went down so let in for weeks and three or four weeks for an hour we probably could have a fast rate other things going on gay so you have four\nWeeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks\nThe one who can get that the the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely\nIt's already been done he's only under get done that quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done that quickly or another senator but Mike Lee is the guy and Michael is the only senator on the list\nTs so so you've got you've got Michaeline you could select Tim let's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow [laughter] which\nI wouldn't strange accident but it could happen I mean it happened in Indiana Jones a and and and ... one of them are the guy would they were fighting on the ... yeah I mean was turning around if that happens to Kevin\nWell this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane there'll be delivering a the New York times guys playing but anyway so let's just say\nAnd it makes him into sausage mhm uh\nYou need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate we're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is ... ... pro life uh and he would vote\n... the bottom line is he cares about the constitution that anything I mean you will vote he will vote the constitution and he will also vote for a ride of life he's not going to go in there with an agenda but he is a right to life guy so Kevin I wasn't good enough here's Mike Lee\n[noise] now doubled un GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen and with a look at your Tuesday weather
