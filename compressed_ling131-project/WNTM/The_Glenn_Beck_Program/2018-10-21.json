or this Sunday in them every single Sunday right here answer your questions talking about things that truly matter as my producer\nNeal and engineer toning enjoy themselves in their own little world we have business to do an ear jets\n\nTracy welcome to Jesus Christ show oh I see what's going on to see\nHow people in my church really wrong with me and the congregation that church with restructuring pastors in ... and now some of those doors are returning back to the church and my question is how do I have fellowship at these people I I can forgive him as I'm called to do but I don't trust them and I feel so protective of my church\nOK rightly so I'm ... ... they're running your church in in what way um you don't give names and so we're supposed to fix but\nThat the pastor was not to put it in a way he should have been and um it was found to be that they really did wrong and and that we had to we had to restructure because people were willing to step down to the the church and to keep the congregation I'm intact\nOkay so this was a big deal it's changed the ... the entire structure of the church was changed but horrible\nAnd the people that have the problem or they\nThey created their own church OK and many of them left that and now it's kind of cutting back almost two years okay so there's a lot of it that it's still there and they'll feel that\nOkay but the but this is the beauty of of this type of relationship if people can make mistakes I guarantee if you look down on the pencils in your house ... research as well right um everybody's going to make mistakes\nThe the purpose of the buddy Christ is not to this is you know there's\nYou've got the reformation and you've got the split of the church and you've got to know Catholics and Protestants and they butt heads on occasion and then the Protestants are making little factions of Protestantism and they've got groups here in groups there now they start butting heads continues to go on and it's the most frustrating part\nA of Christianity\nWhen you were you looking at it so the purpose of it all is for you to all remain tied to the essentials\nAnd those are central store who do you see that I Am a mother the trinity all of these things the resurrection these are the essential or the face the rest is peripheral garbage it's just the\nStuff that the that that you're gonna have to get through it's like in a marriage or any relationship um the essential or important that you love and that you trust each other and that you are are focused on the same purpose of happiness and a gross\nSo in the church you have to be single minded and those things about God not just the church\nAnd if somebody makes a mistake and there's a huge division in our wounds and there are scars and then they come back you have to at least allow that you're going to take place you have to\nAnd many many have come to effort to the church and if if asked for forgiveness or have I'm going for it and acknowledged good at what they've done but I'm asking about the knot\nAnd well then you confront them and that's my question I have absolutely you grow up\nTo them and say listen but you put it on you know that it's not about them this is about you wanting to heal through it um and don't put it like they are doing well usually listen I I'm having a real issue with fish and we were here and we do it here and don't feel that you're better than them 'cause you stood\nBecause everybody will make a mistake right but it's that you're there and you had to watch it and in your pain to buy it\nAnd and each taught that out with them so you feel like\nYou know the church needs an apology or something like that but talk it out to be brothers and sisters in this face and and not be pushing against each

information and all kinds of media sources or\nA you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines law that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors or have always working\nUh you know even even when they listen to their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand you know and everyone knows humans are kind of already an adult when people are you yeah\nOf course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like\nA Google Search engine they turn off the bias detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause I think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust sweats higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate or one cause or one company or whatever it may be one product\nIn search results uh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it now we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people [noise] uh I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea\nBeing manipulated and without leaving a paper trail\nFor authorities to track you\nKnow that is scary\nIt is you um you leave this out in the in the creepy line I'm about\nHow Google has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and\nWithout an agenda [noise] um and then uh how they have ... you know that when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect have absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the U.S almost no one was aware that they were seeing biased or in a search results are still favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was\nThat the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nSo you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you uh we did have a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there in two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent of people in the study a casino bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs are in their voting preferences so you know this is\nThis is unprecedented in human history this is this is\nJust this is an ability to shift people's thinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and ... and it was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs or around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and\nWithout lead because when you're showing something someone search results not like a news story they just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you\nOn the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\n\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know we'll send in Bernays\nA in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that\nThis is the this is\nThe system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda [laughter] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called\nA can of ways big tech can shift\nMillions of boats in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA that's just one of ten ways uh that I've identified over the years that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment\nAh that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\n\nUh and they they they are I mean some of these effects that that that I've discovered\nAmong the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they're ... or ... years and there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well in two thousand and sixteen early she was out of the sixteen or working in secret uh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people are seeing while they were using the Google bang\nAnd Yahoo search engines that was the election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system and so it was a first ever\nCreated and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty late and that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time will actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world\nAnd will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point uh you know our issue we well I Wish we could be fully up and running and time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but\nWe will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nA that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which Glen\n... but I Am I travel [laughter] what\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOh my gosh oh my gosh\nOkay we're going to come back and uh and go through the others if we have time he'll talk about some of the other things Google\nIs doing and what we're supposed to\nDo about it you need to know about it you can see it in the creepy line\nIt's a new documentary the creepy line dot com the freebie line dot com [noise]\nMobiles news radio seven ten WN T.

most prolific serial killer in America is to bring friends and family you do not want to pass up the unique opportunity to change hearts and minds about abortion\nAnd I ended up killing one of these pay\nPay or to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned a lot of fun it was definitely fun fun right hum that he misses don't exist but they called all of our problems anyway right [laughter] the honor that\nUm but yeah so we learned our lesson we we took the criticism we got from that to heart ...\nUh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge\nLike a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of financial racket going on there it's its own big problem and I hope people continue to\nAddress that uh secondly we decided that um we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we hadn't gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise] that would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong\nBut it's it's not what happened um and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's on the recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and since he's been recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published um tell me about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took\nMay be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nOn my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I talked to hell in the other day yeah\nAh so this was in in in the men's amount of work it required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers of typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow\nYeah it's a lot of work there was an insane amount of work and these are all fields\nWe have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers and striking us are only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper in and I paid ... is a\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably\nThe highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight looking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published if people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process\nBut typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure um our paper spanned the ones we wrote spend Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven and\nAnd so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know un un twelve in the pipeline that looked like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end we not gotten pulled\nOKC so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and an

with muscle and to say that that's not true is\nTo be mean to fat people pat phobic as they call it ... and that was accepted\nYeah that was expected that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity or who wrote that who claimed that a Brittany actually as a professional body builder or Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind to this guy being the author of this\nPaper for fat body building was just kind of

of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just said he says this is our bank says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so loaded argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to be in a very privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temporary thing we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the Florence Ames\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being converted and so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what already exist in a great deal of be a feminist than race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrifying this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah first yeah and then later they were a bit concerned with the death of a scholarship and and they kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly paper they claimed for example that we can grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on\nBut um but the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able

but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and\nDoes endorse Medicare for all\nAll the big names are for it already there are many of them were cosponsors of the bill or it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they

will go through this tomorrow but I just\nWant to throw these at ya I'm Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college you know that is a fundamental um a a a a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and it's a big states can control everything well then ... what do we have it can't be that way so we had the electoral college\nWe are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter it will be those three states\nLock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat pretty frightening\nPretty frightening so now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right I mean we have to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this is an idea that\nUm and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and I know Trump sports that for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but\nUh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe this is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean that you know it'd be which have been that wants that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\nRight as citizens should run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural areas can do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand it taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them but I also have to be applied to\nThe city it's ridiculous right and it's headed by the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the other hand out right\nAnd you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could er race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThe way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly\nSo things could be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next the the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was Senator Barack Obama was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they wouldn't be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas way no that's the opposite this the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for king right with these the several stories in our own the ... give you the argument for it came\nRight I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly\n\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and\nThis Swiss army knife has failed or no you're\nNot using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure part right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland but Portland but\nThat's how I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the

shirt stuff started beating\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and and the mayor\n... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse he's\nTrying to make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right they they act and they're just thugs they don't act and their do
