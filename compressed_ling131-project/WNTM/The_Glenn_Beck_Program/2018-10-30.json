check on the press\nSort of this\nThe key message in President Trump's mid term playbook hate the media fear the migrants caravan save me from a democratic oversight\nHe's trying to stay on message despite the Pittsburgh massacre and the fallout from the wave of mail bombs that means he's bashing the fake news while news rooms or on a heightened state of security\nAlert it didn't seem to care about that with me when they were attacking me and my family was under attack that means he's talking about a migrant invasion at the southern border while authorities examined the Pittsburgh shooters

shifting the resources of government to substantiate his lie\nAt the same time on Fox Tucker Carlson review or wrists reassured his views are viewers that migrating caravan is a real thing but what do you do with the invaders\nAll of our Darcy emails I think the natural question to ask is what to do with invaders this rhetoric from Fox is particularly charge because\nA flooded tells the Fox audience one doesn't lead invaders into their home when faced with the invaders one generally uses everything at their disposal to confront them including force and that's the message that Fox is

all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no\nBut what does America say\nIt is classic mail is military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened

far well uh we're one week away and this is one big it falls the with the chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category I'm pulling spend close and now we start to\nTry and move them around a little more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are down to only three tossup races\nOr we have moved uh Missouri and Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident of Indiana\nThe polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time\nUm but we're moving those to lean Republican that the lives there was a Ted Cruz is still lean Republican state\nA ... and a a Mississippi and North Dakota are going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure toss up still and we couldn't really move them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved to Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points place falling has a lot closer are really a toss up race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the top ... category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we moved to Florida to a lean Democrat\nDate a again this is a tough race because you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen a movement towards about towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one as a lean democratic state um we moved from Minnesota as well from\nFaith Democrat to leaning Democrat polling there [noise] you know I still think that's going to the Democrats but at the polling is closer than I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we moved to lean Democrat as well\nOr was a tough race for most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be leaning Democrat at this point ah and let's see we've got a New Jersey and Wisconsin and leading Democrat as well\nSo if if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nFive for Democrats so\nI mean it's pretty it's\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat is the lead it started to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans in the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we see no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big hope for a pick up again this is a state that voted for Trump by thirty points\nAnd Joe mansion I think he you know I think he's solidified his seat there with his pro cabin I'll vote yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and high camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slight leaders were moving these days I Would normally keep those in the tops of category but for a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now yeah I mean people are voting all across the country right now or it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back and give us some of those results on the house terms\nThat

[noise]\nWelcome to the program Mr pat gray who ah precedes this program on the blaze radio and television network a and also has a podcast that you can listen to and download\nAt your leisure ... welcome to the program Patt big news of the day to you is\nI Would say the possibility of the president issuing an executive order ending birthright citizenship ... problem well problem it's an executive order I agree\nWith though [laughter] so you're all day with it yeah whatever [laughter] isn't that the justification yeah that is the justification I think about what happened is it would be challenged and then it would go to the Supreme Court which finally\nOkay for the Supreme Court to rule on that the fourteenth amendment is not about is not about illegals coming you're dropping babies and having them be citizens out you know what it's about no\nThis was clearly again I said yesterday everything after the tenth amendment basically is a ...\nIt's just to reiterate or did you not get this yes blacks\nWe mean black people to pay for that right on the thirteenth amendment fourteenth amendment is oh jeeze okay and they get I'll stop it yeah here ... ... ... ... literally\nDemocrats knock it off ... yes their children are citizens to yeah that's what this was right this is not about coming over here and having\nA baby and then you know a sneaking in cross having a baby and then being able to bring all your family here ludicrous that what that was\n... and so it's interpreted now all this time\nRight but you can't you can't you do it with an executive no but if he's doing it with an executive order so it's challenged and it goes right directly the Supreme Court on kind of okay with it yeah\nAnd that's I think that's what would happen yeah um because they will challenge it\nThey will challenge it and I want I I ... I Hope that there's a way to challenge it more than just\nBecause I constitutionally I think you know the president can take issue an executive order that goes against the constitution but I Would like more than that I Would like them to rule on what the fourteenth amendment actually\nMeans it seems to be a disagreement among even original is with the constitution as to what it actually means or whether that's included and it will be internationally there is yeah I think that would be interesting to see like how that shakes out because you know one of the things we've praised Trump about relatively endlessly is I have been hit the job he's done with the courts\nSo he needs to the judges he's put in would now rule on this and with there being some level of debate even among original is\nWhether this would be allowed or not it was going to be fascinating yeah it does happen imagine\nChuck Schumer and ah and Nancy Pelosi riding up that brief as a friend of the court just come in and say no no judge Kavanaugh\nWe we really believe this that guy has got to be a Superman to not ... not at least think oh\nReally I mean you can usually come with a Pittsburgh shooter and say no really he did it he is really really bad you know we need to incarcerate him not even though we need to incarcerate him and he was you know there's got to be a part of it but just goes\nOh that's what you want [laughter]\nSpeaking of which is interesting to see a everybody bending over backwards in the mainstream media and a lot of the Democrat leadership tried to pin the Pittsburgh shooting on Trump the most pro Israel pro Jewish presidents we've ever had in the history of this country and he's responsible for this it's pretty amazing\nIt is ... ... you know what can we play we play just a couple of things [noise] listen listen to this this how far they have gone so far they've gotten here's here's Joe Scarborough and what he had to say listen to this\nMake a um [noise]\nYou know in a week [noise] people get to make a decision if is the America they want to live in because right now the only constitutional check against this sort of important to have your guy really a guy who was sending a message by time and time again tweeting about face forward\nTalking about his bad hair day there that was done intentionally [laughter] send a message\nTo white nationalist says about me that much\nWith them I'm going to watch a baseball game I'm going to tweet about baseball World Series\nAnd just not that I'm I'm not going to let it occupy my day\nThis is how twisted have become you know so twisted they well and that's from a\n... a hard core conservative yeah chilled our daughter oh nobody's more conservative than Joe no you know not I mean not\nHere's what I Want you to do I want you to take the smart crypto course because I think everybody should have at least a hundred dollars in in ...\nSee it it's just this is game changing stuff and between a bitcoin crypto currency and block chain\nThat is the future and you need to understand it takes is Glenn Beck exclusive course right now smart crypto course dot com smart crypto course dot com or call eight seven seven P.

Fox News President Trump the first lady along with her daughter Yvonne ... son in law Jared Kushner traveled to Pittsburgh to honor the victims of Saturday's mass shooting at a synagogue the president's\nLooking at it to look at the cover of what was it a Newsweek Magazine said we're all socialist now and as soon as we said we're going for socialism\nOr they immediately said were racist now when you point out uh George Soros this week the media is trying to say anybody who disagrees with George Soros is an anti Semite that's kind of the same thing that you found in Hollywood with your case is about\nI did I did and they basically taken the position that anybody that is a Republican or conservative is racist is anti Semite is\nIs a homo phobic and it's just their their way of kind of the ring us I mean I'm an American of Mexican descent and show at my wife is Mexican should first generation\nOr you know a un American\nI ... it's ... they use this identity politics to other us and then they completely ostracized and it just isn't that hack mode and it's something that it it it goes into understanding why Hollywood is so\nLast waning and you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that are so one sided that only tell one side of the story\nSo you know that is when I saw this I said you know what we need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling as a as a way to do that\nSo that's what I ... it was it was astonishing kind of moment to to call out a man that is getting in bed with other people's kids and to actually have the entire community turn on a purely because we were conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go through\nWhat is it that the what is it that they have about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear Hollywood is such a small community and it's run by\nSo few people and it was just such a fear for losing work and one way and it and on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where\nThey're it it's very competitive to to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of the conservative\nUm and then anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets to think of them on conservative that they're conservative they run from that person so that a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like the invasion of the body Snatchers\nThat this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their for getting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very the unhealthy community that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they start to you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years start to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know I I I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking his anymore you seen the rating start to go down but now it's our time and now there's this new frontier for conservatives\nWhere we need to start creating content for ourselves and we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do\nUm and that's what we're trying to do with red tailed America that's on the eye heart radio a pod cast a shooting I heart radio [noise] excuse me I heart radio ...\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you\nThe Patrick I'm\nI have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly that the that the business people looked at Megan Kelly and thought while she's a great gift she's she's very credible she's great interview you know we have our own\nKind of sixty minutes [noise] kind of person I'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire her\nAnd that's when the social justice warriors all around them remind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um\nAnd no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her and so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized ... the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network where their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and the entire me too movement had a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um ... it basically she was you know print brave in doing that um I think you know from a career wise it might have been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet and here's a woman in the me too moment and exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become\nJust a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in the way that it was a God given birth to a man I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and it was easy to get rid of her because of that um so yeah I think that's what happened\nIn the egg and Patrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red
