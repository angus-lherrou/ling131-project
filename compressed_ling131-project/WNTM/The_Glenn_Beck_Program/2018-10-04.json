I'm Sorry I won't take it on somebody else's I'm a word\nI've worked with him we've seen him in social situations it may be true I've talked to him personally I I heard his explanation\nI'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt\nOh my gosh the world ended when I did that guy I lost friends over that okay well whatever so you do not surrender but as I said with Bill O'Reilly if I find new information and Bill O'Reilly actually is that dude I'm going to be the first to torture him\nI've heard you say that to his face yeah or or on the phone yeah you know you said to him yeah but look if if if this turns out to be something that I cannot be associated with but I'm sure they shut down the lowly yeah and he was he was fine with that right [laughter] and so what did the Republicans do first they stood with Kavanaugh because\nThey believed he had a right to answer these charges but they didn't mock her\nThey did say this is a sham because look at the facts\nIf they want if if she would have um appeared during the hearings\nAnd you said well this is a sham cars look out of ... no no no no there's still time but because it came out in the eleventh hour there were facts that led to the Republicans to say and I think any human to say okay wait a minute a slow down on this\n\nWhat did we do the Republicans then said let's hear her they were gracious tour they said we'll come see you what happened the Democrats\nLied the Democrats through a flaming or an insult to anyone who said that the Republicans it'd invited her and she said no you are a monster the Republicans did not respond in kind\nThen they sat down and they listen to her did you see the way that she was treated in the line of questioning nobody rolled their eyes on the right nobody mocked her while she was there\nEvery one was deferential everyone was kind to her everyone wanted her to feel comfortable to speak in case she had something actual to present\nMost Republicans went into watching those hearings with an open mind I listen to her\nAnd I thought okay she has some credibility here now it's time has gone on that has gotten less and less as more facts have come out but I wanted to hear cabinet if Kavanaugh didn't have a strong response I Would have probably been and said I you know I don't know I I think Kavanaugh's\nI don't know I was at least willing to consider that point Kavanaugh spoke I said I Believe Kavanaugh\nOut of the two of them I Believe then it came to the FBI they said look it's just I mean you can't give us seven days just give us seven days okay I'm not for it because I Know what the Republican or the Democrats are actually doing which they did\nBut okay Jeff Flake said seven days so we gave them seven days it's still not good enough for them\nBut nowhere has the Republican Party\nUp until and this is debatable up until a Donald Trump mocked her the other night and I don't think he did he mocks the process he mocked her evidence you didn't lock her he mocked the evidence\nThe evidence is mock up all\nThe ... the Democrats are remarkable but you'll notice no one in the Republican Party has has taken her apart called her name's or anything else what they did do is they sided with righteous indignation\nIf they continue to stand with righteous indignation based on evidence and facts what's happening you're seeing\nA shift in the polls you're seeing people start to say wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute you starting to see people back the Republican Party you're seeing people start to back\nThis entire process as being a sham because we allowed the people to come up with that\nWe allowed the people we just said let's look for facts and the facts will speak for themselves but you will you will not be able to do that if you're punching back while you're looking for facts now this has never worked before that's what\n[noise] now jumbled un GM Gulf Coast weather from NBC Fifteen it with a look at your Thursday forecast

you\n[noise] hey how are you doing very good thanks for calling in what's on your mind\nYes so quick question just kind of going off of your book now with the whole cabinet and going on all the attention seems to have turned away from Trump 'cause there's no outrage there all the allergies with Kavanaugh I'm just kinda wondering how you see the interplay between that\nUm because Kavanaugh is an easier target because Donald Trump has not responded in the fashion that they probably expected him to respond and the reason why I Would imagine is because you know he doesn't have a you know a good record on speaking about\nYou know moral issues and so somebody has said how shop and he has that has that has given him real power because\nThe Trump is a is involved on this is is he going to keep standing and because he has a spine yeah he's standing and that's what the president needs to do at this point and it is also allowed for the very first time\nIt's given a spine to the Republicans so they had to go after Kavanaugh what ... what else are they going to do he's the he's the target but Kavanaugh also has remained cool um until it was\nReally appropriate had he come out and made crazy you know angry statements prior to know\nBut his his timing of being angry is not a sign that he has a reckless temperament it was appropriate for the time if you are thinking human being and you you are looking at things\nFor you're looking at the facts level you completely connected with Kavanaugh's opening statement where he said this is ridiculous you have destroyed me you've destroyed my family he made a statement that was full of facts refuting the things that she had said it was totally appropriate\nWhat's the result the result is I think Kavanaugh is going to the win the nomination\nIf he doesn't and it will be ... be because a Republican or maybe a couple of Republicans lose their spine because there is there are no facts on this so they lose their spine if they do it they will be losers in this\nDoes that help you Brian is that what you were thinking\nYeah that does make sense that this kind of finding the weak target as opposed to the strong line and that's what they do is they exploit the week and um yeah so I appreciate that\nI'm new wanted to I'm going to send you a book for getting on the air is if you get on the air uh start sending your books if

I'm telling you were going to lose Texas because of the Californians they are just going to vote the way they voted out and we are not the same place that's what\nWe're not the same play it on and and they think like California right takes a while so Alexander Hamilton said five years and that's what they went with was five years but you could not vote in America until you've been here five years otherwise you would turn this place into wherever you just left\nNo anchor babies citizens goes citizenship goes from parents to child not to chai not child's apparent\nSecurity risk can be deported and permanently banned from the United states the government must protect the borders during times of war states will have a definite role in immigration so that is what they that's what they originally immigration law okay\n...
