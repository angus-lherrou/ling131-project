I guess you could check your makeup or check your face and make sure you can find and had a couple of spots for some change so when you were getting ready to leave\nYou could take a dime and go over to the pay phone and make a phone call or prior to that you could take a dime or a quarter and get a ride home that showing you how far back those items yeah she made but very very cool little piece of history\nA we have a lot of those available in stock only one on display but probably a dozen of them available for people to look at\nBack when smoking was not shunned like it is nowadays they have some absolutely amazing sterling silver cigarette and cigarette cases\nThat are very very beautiful designs including one that has a hand painted design on the inside that you would be embarrassed to see and you would probably be very upset his uncle Henry to look at that because\nThe lady is not wearing a whole heck of a lot but it was good to have ... unbelievably beautiful designed to be painted on the inside of the of the cigarette case but the cigarette cases solid sterling silver so that is very cool and very different very evocative of a different time in our history\nA you start moving forward from that you can look at some of the sterling silver rings and earrings and bracelets and a lot of times people look at them and like you said they're shocked and disbelief that's only twenty nine dollars is a catch twenty nine dollars it's a sterling silver bracelet looks like a beautiful expensive gold tennis bracelet but it's not a sterling silver with some ...\nIt's basically thirty dollars so if you wear it for a while and love it that's great if you accidentally lose hope you don't but if it happens\nYou're not out thousands of dollars you're out less than fifty bucks so people love picking up gifts like that for themselves girlfriends boyfriends kids grandkids are all sorts of different silver rings I mean we have many many rings out there on display we have many more that are not out on display\nOr then moving up into some of the ... pieces and those many of those are new items so we have the slider charms\nThat are very popular for both Alabama Auburn south Alabama ... we can actually get pretty much any harm that's in the SEC but we don't necessarily carry all of those in stock I'm also earrings we've got the south Alabama jak earrings and necklaces and yesterday she can come out of the shop and check those out\nAnd then we have those those silver rounds and some some gold bracelet school necklaces some very very beautiful gold earrings there in the front case and getting up sort of sliding over into the coin and and currency side of things everything's from some beautiful Morgan silver dollars some old Confederate paper money from the you know from the Eighteen sixties\nIs obviously a we actually have some United States currency from the late Eighteen hundreds as well very interesting bits of history there a twenty dollar goal he says five dollar gold pieces we had a one dollar gold coin back in the day did you know that\nI didn't know didn't have a clue\nTiny little thing about the size of your your fingernail but very very interesting little little bit of gold there and you're like what the heck is that that's a dollar coin but so small I mean I lose it if I put it in my pocket it would probably fall out I'd lose that aren't the smaller than a dime but a solid gold coin\nUm you start looking at some of the coins we have on that side of things we talked about those trade dollars we have those ancient Roman coins that I Know you were very excited about\nThe fact that you can hold a piece of history in your hand something that is two thousand years old and was actually money and worst something at the time is pretty amazing to me um I think you like a lot of the silver dollars as\nWell right yeah absolutely do absolutely did so a lot of people like the beautiful ones that are beautiful and circulated condition you can see all the details but\nI like the ones that are so worn down they the stories they could to we're gonna have to cut that we didn't get through a pet at the door yeah we didn't get get halfway through so a take a tour yourself mobile bay coins and fine jewelry twenty two oh for government street image immobile\n[noise] in some of the stuff we've talked about you can see on the mobile by Quentin fine jewelry Facebook page [noise]\nWe don't think about how much we use our hands in day to day functions or realize just how complex and delicate our hands are until they're hurt\nAnd that's when we can turn to the specialist at Alabama orthopedic clinic immobile uncle Henry here for a oh see welcoming Dr Jeffrey boat ride to a oh sees team of handed upper extremity specialists they had the training to provide specialized care for both\nCommon and complex hey that upper extremity injuries and conditions things like carpal tunnel syndrome trigger finger tennis elbow Ganguly insists this locations fractures in the other injuries your hands are in great heads and Alabama orthopedic clinic from surgery to therapy I Yossi has the staff\nSo he wasn't exposed and the fact is I Believe a yes or every country that has relations with Brazil's a has a reason to be concerned because we still don't have any clarity on how will be a ...\nGovernment to trade so you don't know exactly what's coming he he\nGrew up in a time where there was military rule in Brazil and that was that was overthrown a and democracy came and she has hinted in the past that\nUh that's the way you know you should run a government he has he has called for in ... what are the Ninety nine a civil war\nUm and the liquidation of about thirty thirty thousand Brazilians he is extraordinarily divisive but he is not he's not talking about a smaller government he is talking about a government run by the military or at least be has in the past correct\nAnd he's still around it by military so a haze closest advisors today are a military so a a an exception is a ... just a that is appointed as he's minister of economy this guy is a liberal so\nWe have several differences of regarding President Trump as you mentioned he's a he's a liberal\nAnd he uh comes as he had strong relationships with financial markets in Brazil so\nThis is the man that he points that out as a the base of the trust in his government but uh\nHe said he uh ... it's not clear how he will manage his own team he has had some trouble controlling\nOr his advisers that have given a interviews\nOr saying things that he had later to a unauthorized them so uh it is possible that uh he will close down and keep a very closed government regarding the press for example he has been using social media as his base the communication tool [noise]\n... this is the kind of ... kind of the same thing that you go job is said\nWhen he was running the first time he said oh no it's not going to be this way I'm not going to do and he immediately came in and he started taking over the media and and the\nNationalizing everything is ... is there a ... ... is that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him but as the military and is it\nWhen you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect here most analysts are don't see any mediate a risk to democracy as here we'll take office and\nImmediately he will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time\nWhat is expected is that maybe he could uh promote some change in constitution\nAnd it is not clear how he would do it he has\nA suggested that he could create a council that would ah create a new constitutions for Brazil and that would be submitted\nTo a vote for ah after it so and in ... to to people to a electors in general so\nHe had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back when he takes office\nBecause the fact is that he's not going to debate he uh is giving a just a few interviews and usually he controls the process has been speaking mainly through social media so he has no conversation from\nThe press and this ah creates a and unknown territory we don't know what's coming but a analysts most analysts don't expect something so drastic ah right at the time ... clothing because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong\nA performance in ... from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of governance ... he and he will be able to do some of the changes that he intends\nTo but we still don't know exactly what what are those changes\nIt can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\n[noise] uh that ... son it ... and he posted on line a while back a photo of him I'm next to ban in and said that\nAs said he would be glad to help in the campaign or something like this at this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved and was responsible in a great part of a bull so not a strategy\nBut a ... himself a came to public afterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it\nWhat do we know fact is that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ...\nAn expression of this right wing movement that with the uh in other parts of the world and he quotes a Donald Trump and is a movement so he understand that it's a it's a clear wave in that\nDirection and so now that would be an expression of this but we had no a clear indication that he would be involved there is a picture of him close to the president's a presidential candidates an a and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow that we don't know exactly at what point\n... Clarissa when when is the election final fifty\nNine percent of valid votes and ... that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one\nSo it's a big fence and considering the current ... we'll ... we'll be elected uh we uh yesterday we had a recent poll that gave also now fifty nine percent of valid votes and\nThen that that that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one\nSo it's a big ... and uh we we would have to have a new fact something that would be strong enough to change the scenario and and it's very likely that hit\nHere with the election and a signed up to some more we'll be following a thank you so much for pre shit okay\nThank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history a he has\nA he has a a very very strong history of um\nOf dictatorship a love and passion and uh he is non it'll blow you away\nIs it just because you know like the Washington Post really cares what happened to this guy so therefore it's become a big issue because if you can go after a cushion her and and and Trump because of the relationship what what what do you think\nI say yes on all of that I'd say yes to all of that um I don't think if this guy was a preacher\nNobody would have been paying attention rather did we got one back and no one yeah nobody seemed to care of this one because it's one of there's\nA the press cares more about it but also foreign soil and you know the suitcase thing it's a pretty amazing story\nWere mobiles season for news radio seven ten doubled un P.

I'm going all full I I'm I'm just I'm going to\nI just thought let's all complain\nAbout the names of out ball teams but what's ... how ... from here on out our our audience what's called our tribe and we mean it in the Native American sense it's a tribe to trial it does\nThe I mean there are studies that show that the average person of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to show that\nThey've chosen show any DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want any\nDNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test the DNA against we have to use people from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well way\nAnd there's the the theory is that they those the same people want to migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she is Native American blood is not even what they tested or and even that it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you\nIf you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed and like to point out over the years he would not show the his Canadian blood\nRight like that's not the only to get what they said oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore\nHe was Canadian with DNA does is it shows that lineage against shows if it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns since\nWonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's a thousand times more Hispanic than a hundred friends disorder or [laughter]\nThat's true it probably would show that uh but it's always interesting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and\nFalling flat on her face first of all as it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was\nUm it was her great great great great grandmother I think ah several generations back and um when she register it was in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and and this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of thing you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right ... and they were able to get away with that\nThere'd be some serious incentives to do that number one obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother Titanic secondarily yeah but what have we learned from progressive\nWe've learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now or denying her what she herself has identified as\nShe said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not that was what we were not allowed to apply to any money we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have\nTo accept that she is so we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter\nDoesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous this story is just so rich I don't really care I don't care either but I don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just like look I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those yet those got them you know we've got to start making them\nOr I Want one more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from however\nYou know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my ... my grandfather actually took a horse of being a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet\nAnd he talked to him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else ... and\nHe took him and he punched him in the head and knock the horse out okay so in my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this\nAnd he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's true I gotta go in and say it's not my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true oh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing you oh yeah\nThis is what it was but it was the was it was not true somebody advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls and I was ... I almost made it\nInto WWE but how many times have you told a story you been on the air for how many years never never I've never you you've you've yeah yeah yeah I get it I again if she\nIs ... trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you better be right on these things and that's\nWhy I decided I can give you that I got what it's about is I give you that you're not a huge story I mean ... you know we will you know what is a huge part of the story is the Cherokee Nation came out yesterday and said quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship\nCurrent DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lint lineage such as return ally a to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation using a da and ... a test to claim any connection to a Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nIs inappropriate and wrong and\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses wildest honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal air at the edge okay look it's not a good look\nYeah they're they're not they're not offering the piece by peer to her or she should probably zip it\nAnd it does not go on this whole saga of the last few days with the ... as you point out ridiculous story does this not ... the whole uh serve as a gigantic warning sign to Democrats to not nominate her this is\nA oh no no no no I look I Want to know\nThis is this is science to show she's ... years of high really she yeah she's great she's great she'll get the the minority vote\nShe'll get the Native American vote and vote and a huge crush while anybody who is one one thousand twenty six of anything is going to be voting for I'm afraid of her she should\nNow W.

wouldn't have been that different on friday night the the guys who are looking for a fight they got in some extra kicks right and so that's maybe five seconds of violence that wouldn't have happened if it went your way\nThat's five seconds out of three days of terror or anti Islam was was threatening to venue they were giving death threat to this old lady who answered the phone they're\nGay hang on hang on we're starting to let's go back to what you were doing what the venue is what will [laughter] and you have to hit on the poster because uh [laughter]\nI think the poster is just a entertaining but go ahead\nWell I Would try it again I'm a Gucci killed his socialist samurai sword in Nineteen sixty and it's a funny trolls that a lot of right wing guys do it sort of like the tennis shaping\nRewrites the helicopter rides for companies in the early part of a satire right right so it it it's that kind of set up I announce it on Tuesdays call myself a toy again like Gabby\nAnd I bought a shot myself into his mom shot um second we announced that and anyone who knows me to know is that a satire antifa\nGoes all the blast they started attacking the venue attacking the old lady there the calls are coming from all over the country by the way\nSo this was a planned attack that anti for his work I think the in the in the people working in their hand traditional as well organized and well funded\nSo then that those attacks continue night before the venue totally trashed windows smashed ridiculously pretentious manifesto nailed to the door that says that we put the Republicans on notice\nA this is only the beginning we are not civil which by the way the Hillary quote a then I get to the venue that night for the next night total in outer chaos you're just we made signs screaming hurling bottles of your and\nOne of them hit my car on the way out or ... or organized rallies like\nThere's this kind of ... you'll see if you really get deeper into the foxhole where he is calling in the front thing you know you guys over there over there I citizen journalists get beat up\nThey take a backpack their police to arrest him\nAnd then they they arrest the citizen journalist\n... no not sorry they arrest three of the of the end who mob this guy okay but I had I interviewed him today and he was talking about coordinated attacks it seemed very military so this isn't anarchy these anarchist circling off\nWell you you know I I don't know I'm sure you are um and to FAA Austin\nIs a on their Facebook page has called for a guerrilla style tactics they've they've called for a what do they call it a black shirt army or something I read a a red shirt army I Can't remember 'em but they're calling for\nPeople that just want to go out and do what ... normally does but they're also calling now for a an actual standing army and they were looking for people that know military tactics that could teach people so that's that's happening and of course Facebook doesn't have a problem with with covering that but\n... must be the Mets had tried that police are looking for that my citizen journalists told me about [noise] um so yeah that those guys were charged with assault and robbery because they took his backpack so now you know when I by the way peaceful in the uh Martin Luther king guy ... saw the same experience right up till now and it's been days\nAnd then when it's time to leave I come out there I've got my plastic\nSword I make a choice that you know what can you choke and that's when they hurl the urine that may I jump in the car\nAnd then a group of Proud Boys are are the last ones to go they they leave and the video just came out yesterday on breaking nine one one on Twitter\nThey're attacked by antifa fully clad with all their gear and they throw a bottle at them and the huge fight breaks out and now the newer world that fight would have been you know hey cops cops or something like that\nAnd then Malcolm X world it's a little bit longer but again five to ten seconds different so we're splitting hairs here you know the real issue is we're up against homicidal lunatics with no gender helped plan and it's not like they know where we're going to get\nYou know our our gas and oil from after the revolution and these guys just want to burn America to the ground and the media is on their side\nYou know so it's so frustrating because um we had the same kind of thing happening out in in Portland, Oregon and uh you know Portland has I I don't know who this mayor is what I mean\nWhat the hell is he doing where that they're already directing traffic ... the police are standing a block away and then they do nothing\n[noise] well my understanding with these super laughing towns like Berkeley in Portland is\nThe mayor allows anti for re chaos and then he can say sorry Trump's supporters are trouble I mean look at all the chaos that happens when someone who likes Trump shows up when when Republicans and conservatives are around so well that's just you know if you don't want to antifa around stopping huh\nThat's their sort of Monaco and it works\nIt's interesting because it because the initial video seemed to indicate that you guys were in the wrong that they had they started this and and they started the violence\nThe second video that was released however shows clearly someone from ... throwing something a at a at a the ... the Proud Boys and and the Mets won the fight breaks out it was not something that you guys at least ... the main one that has been covered it was not something that you guys instigated\nAnd it's strange how quick the media is to run with the evil Nazi narrative without doing any research whatsoever and isn't it strange to how the media takes up five second clip and makes that\nThe total story when we have days and days and days or some subterfuge stays in the domestic violence it's almost like I'm at I'm at a point now I think they don't just like ... but they are antifa\nI think a lot of these journalists these little hostile bloggers will go to rallies the masks on I'm convinced\nI Will tell you I I uh\nI'm having a very hard time defending a the press which I have\nTried to be more moderating or on my on my words with the press but the the deeper we get in to the violence on the streets and the calls for kick them when they're down in all of this stuff are you there is no excuse when when when the when they will not Cole\nA mob mob an angry mob when everybody knows what that means I I don't know what I I don't know what to say I I mean how\nDo you and I can't go to restaurants Tucker Carlson just today said he can't go to restaurants and no one and only when conservative can go to a restaurant today that's a new one and it's because the the media will throw around a white supremacist\nLike it it means absolutely nothing a white supremacist as someone who sees white people as above all other races just inherently better and wants all the other races out of America that is that we're markedly esoteric\nView to have it it's a crazy if you to have and they just throw it on it and it sticks like glue\nAnd it affects our families affects our lives affects our personal lives\nThere's gotta be some culpability there\nOkay so Gavin hold on for a second I Want to own a take you over across the breaking and just\nAsk you what it is and you believe what is the America then you see and that you are fighting for [noise] back was Gavin McGinnis coming up and just a second let me tell you a little bit about gold lying if you\nThink this
