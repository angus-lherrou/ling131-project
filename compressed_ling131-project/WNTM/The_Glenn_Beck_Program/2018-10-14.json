I mean because I saw lots of tea partiers going to the Supreme Court in banging on the on the walls and by the way I have plenty of Supreme Court decisions that make me want to bang on the walls of the Supreme Court right but we don't do those things\nBecause they're both were supposed to be in a civil society right I Am I trying to remember I'm trying to remember all of the people to tea partiers\nUh chased down with their children you know and the homemade signs how many people they chased down in restaurants and surrounded cannot think of one exam in fact if you want an example of this what did dancey below sea do during the health care bill\nShe and a was a John Lewis marched out in to the crowded\nIn to the crowd trying to get them to do that and they wouldn't do you remember where\nThey tried to get them to be violent they said all kinds of crazy things throw gasoline all over them and then they linked arms in March bravely through that crowd when they didn't have to\nThey were trying to get the Tea Party to become of violent mob they didn't\nCan you imagine what would have happened if Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh would have linked arms and tried to walk through the crowd in Washington D.

they're taking over that's ... that's a riot that is why it by a mob yeah did you define mob police look it up in the dictionary find out let's let's make sure we\nKnow what we're talking about mob\nMob a large crowd of people especially one that has this orderly and intent on causing trouble or violence\nOkay and and the quote is a mob of protesters that say their usage so is this\nNot a disorderly crowd of people that are trying\nTo ... to ... percent on causing truck in tents on causing trouble I mean I guess if you think well Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person and stopping him is good so that's not causing trouble I mean if you going to go down that road I guess the end that that doesn't does it say there and unless you're right\nJust as intent on causing trouble right it doesn't say you know ... with an exception of those who are absolutely right what what I'm saying\nThough is that the media does not see harassing conservatives as causing trouble correct\nThat is the issue correct they see this as a parade feed it that's like the you know there it's basically you know charity we're at right I mean they're they're doing good for the people you're stopping these evil or old white people who have names like Cruz\nOr that you know [laughter] things better yeah [laughter] I mean they are by the Irish guy who runs this hour or [laughter] let me tell you the white people white people do ya [laughter]\nReally bad oh really [laughter] okay\nSo let's listen to a couple of things first we have CNN we just played oh you're not going to call it a mob yes I'm going to

of\nHe's the one who has been violence in his speech he said why things like this I lacked punch him in the face Trump said that at one of his rallies he said knock the crap out of them are what you and seriously okay Jeff Mack the hell I mean okay alright okay we\nGot it now and that's what she's saying she's saying that Donald Trump is the one who's violent and their speech a let's go to

...\nI think there's real trouble on the way and has reason to say that here's Rand Paul\nWhen people like Cory Booker said get up in their face he he may think that that's okay but\nWhat do you have to realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face\nWhat I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violence when I was at the ball field which basically was

to bring our best when the world is at its worst headsets or just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books on outrage kind of a nice time you could talk about outright\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to do diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime you know rage and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you\nKnow damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged his response would be very different than yours and I appreciate your responded\nA and mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean that just said I'll just say I'll just say it you know dance response or the way a lot of people feel like I Know you are\nThere's a lot of built up outrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country ... from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about\nReligious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again I I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups\nRather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture is old\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about bond offer and that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandon their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution\nUh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture and our and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not everybody we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that we live in two in every generation of space there are challenges\nBut this is our moment and it ends in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways\nA that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now the views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to hum we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is\nAnd the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around to the American woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know don't stand up for things don't I mean when you said your fight but you fight or a you know for example uh you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly to not\nParticipate in creating photo and false crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically\nWere winning I mean look at the Supreme Court but the Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president would have stood up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways but you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know\nA trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because it they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\nWell I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a there's a difference\nBetween the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the girl does of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life\nAnd then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some some self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them yeah and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life not yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were\nKind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's\nOur goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot in Christians in the age of outrageous is to just to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some approach and and and plan for what's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey\nAs well and I think it really challenge a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions are so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all just for tea juggling you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses in Jesus and\nWe take Jesus Moses out who are we modeling who are we modeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our art type [noise] back in just a second [noise]\nClan that\nTake

doctor Kermit costs now how the woman goes into a clinic comes out of there is no police report and I helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover\nAnd in the process we're able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a is the president by oil university which is a Christian university in California uh met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party and state legislature there in California\nThat was trying to change laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more well he ended up getting to understand each other better the will the bill was ultimately not moved forward was dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now\nI'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying that Christians need to try to do that\nAnd I do think that in doing so well act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically because of the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean ... that's not an uncommon of you know some of the some of the worst\nThings I see on social media I I click on a link and I find go to the bio and its first think listen the thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained as slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you\nI'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're gonna come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit and we're going to crucify you the family set down kids at all and wrote a letter and said we understand we forgive you for that\nWe're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with Peter unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate because you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about trying to hold back the advance of course that he's a pagan\nAnd he says this a while for the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these in pious galleons empire ... not only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their about by the name of the
