Fox News President Trump in Florida this hour the first time in a campaign plates in the final days before the midterm\nReally didn't produce much and in fact he was really allowed to just you know\nCreate a lot of victims so a lot of the victims of Bolger are still very angry with the federal government or the department of justice\nRuin the victims be\nA ... you know to dozens of families who were the victims of white these crimes I mean why do you what\nI see what you're saying but he did he put anybody behind bars did he have did he ran out anybody that\nIn the end that a government get anything\nAh that's open to debate the Boston Globe would tell you that yes yes he was a wonderful informing him that they broke the story but there's evidence to suggest that it was a it was a greater cover for just protecting Whitey because with the uh a\nFederal authorities trying to crack down on the mob or the Italian Mafia or any hit on the mafia would have to run through a Bulger's winter hill gang and some people feel and claim and there was strong evidence to suggest\nThat the informing part\nWas just the cover and really\nThey were allowing Whitey the live so that the then head of the strike force in New England to bring down the Italian Mafia a guy named Jeremiah Tio solve and was looking for a little quid pro quo like hey Whitey we'll let you do your thing as long as you make sure the ... the mob doesn't you know\nKill me ah because there were incidence of lawyers and prosecutors are getting killed in retaliation for bringing down the mob so you know a lot of those allegations have not been proven but his real\nConnection to the information that he gave as being actually great invalid and information is\nIs to me one of the myth of this case\nUh you know we'd we'd need much longer\nTime period to really discuss it but the documentary kinda delves into the how much free reign the guy was given and again if you're an informant for the government\nIt doesn't mean you can go and commit crimes that means you're working hand in hand with the government in exchange for some benefit like a ... like not being prosecuted or a lesser sense it doesn't mean oh please go out and Rob kills steel and maim people are and there were there have been several\nCivil suits brought against ah the department of justice that have not gone and the families a direction and so there's a lot of that there's still a lot of bitter feelings amongst the people who were who were victims of Bulger's crimes some of them were you know criminals themselves but that doesn't that doesn't mean it's still a man or\nThe end doesn't justify the means arrive for this guy for a quarter century\nUh was allowed to just kill with impunity I mean he was tipped off in advance a about wiretaps he was tipped off in advance about potential rates are so it's really a complicated and in fact some people believe that\nThe sixteen years he was on the lam living in an apartment in Santa Monica with his girlfriend Catherine Greek uh there there are many including myself who believe that the government really wasn't looking very hard for him until a new regime came in and then after sixteen years they decided to bring him to justice and\nAnd there was a trial in the summer of twenty thirties\nSo let's talk a little bit about the first myth that you talked about that he was known as a you know a good guy in the neighborhood isn't that yeah I mean this is my impression and maybe I'm wrong in this isn't that kind of the thing with you know Al Capone\nTried to do that and you know people like to think that I don't know these guys are just you know they're whack in just the bad guys there actually good family man you know and there was a day when you would kill a man and then you'd send his wife flowers\nYeah is that any of that true\nI ... that seems to be the case that ah you know he also did some very good things as well you know for at times but for for some people um and also for example there was a big bussing crisis in South Boston you know a there was an attempt to\nDesegregate and there was a a bussing order issued and Whitey actually was very vociferous ... you know in campaigning against it and that kind of\nRallied south Boston residents are ... to him um\nHe was a good guy but because I mean that helped create cover for him and then a hill\nYeah exactly and his brother was a famous politician so there was all you can\nUse in there as well you know with a will you know bill Bolger president of the University of Massachusetts in a prominent politician I'm so there was a lot of messy gray areas there with the balls\nAre so how did he was he involved was he just the guy saying yay whack him or was he involved in the killings\nOh he he took pleasure [laughter] and and being involved in the killings and you know his his signature because back then there was no DNA evidence his signature was removing teeth of his victims um you know uh so that they couldn't be identified\nBut no no he was a it was a willing and ruthless participant in some very grisly murders and how was that there was a there was a a\nNeighborhood house that they had called the haunting where a number of these victims were buried in the in the dirt basement of of the actual house that they used as a meeting place so there's ... there's just a\n\nLot of grizzly detail with with this case but uh I mean the real for me the fascinating thing is after sixteen years\nOn the land they finally caught him in Santa Monica living quiet you know living a a quiet a life a\nRetirees life you know he had a ... almost nine hundred thousand dollars in cash and stuck in the walls and the coterie of a machine guns and weapons but living a just a quiet life and when he's finally\nCaught and brought back to\nBoston for trial you know he offered to plead guilty in exchange for this is another I've been looking at some of the notices and these are some of the things that have been left out you know he offered to plead\nGuilty if they would take it easy on his girlfriend has you know who is living girlfriend Catherine ... who joined him for the sixteen years of being on the run on and off you know he ... he was willing to plead guilty if they would take it easy on her and give her some very light treatment a and the\nGovernment refused and you have to ask yourself why why did we go through a multimillion dollar\nTrial a four Whitey Bolger when the ... you know the the the conclusion\nWas foregone at the smarter than trial nobody thought he would be found not guilty I mean the evidence was just overwhelming um and it probably\nWould have saved the state uh quite a bit of money to not try him but but ah they didn't take it easy on um um how they can grow and how they catch him\nA there was you know they decided to focus on the girlfriend and they play some advertisements a and a woman or ... you know noticed ah not Whitey but the girlfriend and called it in and got a nice reward for that\nSo we have suddenly prosecuted the woman who turned him in\nA well no no no no not the woman who turned\nOh another okay another woman did not the girlfriend another woman current event okay okay yeah now he was killed yesterday I never I I I mean I besides Dr seuss I didn't know who would come up with a lock in a sock\nA buddy apparently was was killed by a guy they think is they I should say is\nThere is a guy in prison who is a mob hit man who they think killed him they know we use a mob hit man I'm who would was everybody against this guy was he marked for death as soon as they could kill him\nA well look I don't I don't have the details of yesterday and it's you know it's hard to say but you know he is responsible for helping or you know bring down the Italian Mafia so you would imagine that uh there would be people who would be out for his his death or and you have to ...\nI shouldn't you know the the security and you know it's still unclear to me I'm Still trying to get some information as to why he was being moved that why the multiple moves and why the lack of security uh you know some people are speculating that this was a purposeful move\nUh I I Can't say that but um you know a guy who's involved in\nMultiple murders over decades and involved in bringing down the mafia or you know with ... with you know be a target\nWhere we're talking to a job earlier he is the director of why the United states of America versus James Jay a blogger who is the you know Whitey I'm and I'm I
