I think that's pretty good analogy so I went out there can understand now there is no one and done procedure the more sun damage you have the more years we're trying to correct\nEven with the CEO to it's going to take several treatments to take care of it and so he ... the CEO to we generally tell patients enter probably be healing for five to seven days\nAnd really that's to the patients benefit because when I was in training\nWhich now is getting further and further in the rearview mirror about Seventeen years ago we didn't have that option you it was all or nothing and so he literally take the entire outer layer of skin off and you let that region right over about a month\nAnd you can imagine with all the bacteria and viruses are environment it was really hard to keep patients from getting a secondary infection and if they got a secondary infection they had all kinds of complications so\nI'm I'm sure that there's some people that are listening that would love the idea of of a a resurfacing to use that term again\nUh but they may think well I'm sixty too many years the sun or I'm sixty five too many years the sun why even consider it can it work for somebody in their sixties\nI think it's a wonderful procedure for someone really of any age\nUm you know a number one all of us are living longer which is a good thing and so I mean I can remember my grandfather you know and he was one of these guys that do you know doesn't matter um I'm I'm leaving this world tomorrow we're going to see you know going to have an ... you know right I think you said that for about at least a decade or longer we'd only two that I have that person uh my\nAnd way too that did the same thing in worried about passing away Twenty years ago\nSo yeah and so I think that I'm most patients are really excited to take good care of themselves and like we like we said we're living longer patients are feeling great\nYou know seventies eighties even in their nineties there there are still active they're still getting out there uh and so I think that you know we're going to see patients getting procedures like this on up into their uh upper ... upper ages\nSo somebody sixty five Seventy years old if they come in for CEO to retrieve a nation they're going to get a good result\nThey are now they're probably going to need more treatments live then if they would have come in when they were forty five or fifty five and of course that's also depending on how much sun damage to the head now if there's someone who worked outside is a PE teacher worked outside in construction or you know those type of of\nYou know employment opportunities then they're going to have a lot more sun damage and they probably need to come in sooner than someone who has an inside job us alive you know most of us didn't do the right thing in our teens and twenties well and we got busy with work and kids and got a little wiser and start wearing sunscreen we did have an opportunity to get outside and so\nMost places that come to see is even ones who are growing skin can't just say you know I haven't even been outside much down not a beach go or whatever for the last two decades but\nI tell them all what we're doing the forty years before that [noise]\nYes so the results are going to depend on how we treated our skin through the years correct but you're still going to get some results even if you come in sixty five Seventy are older you're still going to get some results yes now I when I go to advanced during clinic dot com your ... as website\nI look at all the different lasers you've invested in every kind of technology possible to help people out and help people get the best\nPatient outcomes can you explain the difference in C. O. two for for re Juba nation of skin versus the peak kosher laser 'cause they both understand or used to revitalize the skin but they're different lasers\nThey are the the ... second laser or you know we had the ... for the exact laser we have the peak of second lasers those are the most advanced lasers that are made\nAnd actually you know I think he probably have to drive at least four or five hours in any direction to find another one they're they're very expensive piece of equipment\nOr you're not proud of myself as a electrical engineering major the air force academy having an absolute best technology available out there and so we're actually using that one for both face rejuvenation and tattoo removal and we had patients that are driving from three states to come to Mobile Alabama Daphne, Alabama to get those treatments\nBut the big difference is it will take more treatments to achieve the same go with the Pico laser versus the CEO to the big benefit for the Pico is no downtime you have some redness swelling maybe for a few hours and that's it\nOr less risk of complications um it's just very forgiving procedure so I think that that's really the big difference that I educate patients on and what we'll do is a lot of patients will want you know as much bang for their buck out of the gates loaded the CEO to\nAnd sometimes it's hard even for a retiree to find a week the hill so those are the ones here too and then they'll kind of you know come in and they'll do a series of Pico laser procedures over the next one to two years and they're going to turn back the

I mean so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating as you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're nuts if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go Google device yeah not use them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance apparatus only\nYeah ... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know and one of the reasons they do is it the best what\nRight like this is a problem because the the part of the reason why it's the best one is because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right\nUm you know or the search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used as it's better than a you know I'm ... I mean\nYou know as you get into deep stuffing you but I don't even know how to unwind myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know what you talked about with um certain browsers a use other uh you know at all apple products right use Google\nFor the injured search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go duck duck goes a a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using and I went to go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on chrome\nSo now I got straight ...

and there's no police report I helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions not suspect abortion because now movie opens October twelve\nA you know people ranting and raving on the radio and television and newspapers and magazines and all that stuff is competitive and people are very wary about it you know they they're they're biased detectors or have always working\nUh you know even even when they listen to their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are kind of already had about ...\nPeople are you yeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows that the research shows when people are using something like\nA Google Search engine they turn off the biased detectors they automatically become very trusting because they think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOne cause or one company or whatever it may be one product\nIn search results uh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed him in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it now we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people a I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes where there's no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track you know that is scary\nIt is you um you leave this out in the in the creepy line\nI'm about how Google has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda [noise] um and then ah ... how they have ... you know\nThat when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search result uh that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrect you absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the last\nAlmost no one was aware that they were seeing biased or in a search result socialist I favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nSo you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you uh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there in two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent of people in the study uh could see no bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs are in their voting preference says so you know this is\nThis is unprecedented in human history this is this is\nJust this is an ability to shift people's thinking and behavior worldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and it was they had the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs or around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and\nWithout leaving a paper trail because when you're showing something someone search results I felt like a news story they just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\nWould you is it an overstatement to say whether it's um you know Wilson and Bernays\nA in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that this is the\nThis is the system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda\n[noise] [noise]\nOh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article a called a can of ways big tech\nCan shift millions of votes in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation effects are seen as the eye me\nThat's just one of ten ways uh that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment\nAh that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they're I mean some of these the effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd their ...\nAnd there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\nWell into thousands sixteen early two thousand sixteen or working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people were seeing while they were using the Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was the election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders\nIt's called the monitoring system and so was that first ever created and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton who am I favored by the way as you mentioned\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty late and that's pretty extreme overseas leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nThat we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point\nUh you know our issue we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I Would say that's not going to happen but\nWe will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at\nMore than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nOr that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which\nGlenn in trouble [laughter]\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay I'm who's ... hey [laughter]\nAll right let's let's say that are a very good in the
