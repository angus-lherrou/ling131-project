the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate the way they got elected yeah it it used to be\nThat the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly\nSo things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly\nThen the next ... the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much slower but it wasn't just that it was slower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for wrecked trying I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was Senator Barack Obama was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they wouldn't be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president\nIs only supposed to veto saying if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas way no that's the ... the the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\n\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed\n[laughter] are you arguing for king right with these several stories in our own the mic give you the argument for it came right\nI mean okay really they've failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I'm trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed\n[laughter] or no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for and I would also argue the failure park right you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland but Portland but that's how I I'm\nSorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry\nSo you know the ... last week the\nPortland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing

you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [noise] I mean\nEspecially with a union job would be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter]\n[noise] what ... what what laws do you even have in Portland now\nYou can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young women they break his window and chased him down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they had a a\nA law and order march and anti fall showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law browns shirt stuff\nStarted beating kicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and the mayor\n... release a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we do want to make it any worse\nHe's trying to make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right they they act and they're just thugs they don't act and their do nothing's\nUse used affects your life imitating why America\nOf and the latest

going over it with you\nYou know the saying may you live in interesting times they always say oh that's a Chinese curse that it's really not no it's not may you live in interesting times is not a Chinese in fact the first place that we can really find it being sad\nIs in the Yorkshire Post that's in England in Nineteen thirty six a guy stood up in parliament his name was a sir Austin Chamberlain and he was um uh he was a meeting with union is\nAnd uh he spoke of the grave injury to collective security by Germany's violation of of the treaties so he\nSaid look I'm not so long ago\nI spent some years of service in China and there there was this old Chinese fellow who told me of a curse may you live in interesting\nTimes and there is no doubt that this curses followed up on us so it's not a Chinese it's this this guy is the only one is the only place we can really find this but I've always liked that\nBecause I don't think it's a curse it's a it's a\nIt's just the saying and you decide if it's a blessing or a curse I personally think it's a blessing\nMy dad taught me what I was really young that no matter what happens to you there is no bad\nNow he taught me this when I was really young but it took it took me hitting rock bottom alcoholism divorce everything else my life completely falling apart before I really learned that it took a dark chapter in my life that that taught me there is nothing that life can hand you that is in itself bad\nIt just depends on what you do with it\nIs this going to change you in destructive ways is it going to make you\nAngry are you going to be filled with bitterness and despair are you going to be looking for vengeance\nBlame\nOr will you allow whatever calamity has come your way to strengthen you\nThrough enlightenment through correction new understandings humility\nIt's up to you\nSo living in interesting times I think that's a blessing\nAnd we're going to learn this one way or another we can either learn this the easy way like with my dad telling me or we all learned the hard way like I actually had to take hit the end and learn through just total collapse\nBut one way or another humility will rain again because we have we have an unbelievable lack of humility in DC in Hollywood of a story today to tell you about Michael ... play who's now quitting\nThe music industry he says he's tired of the celebrity nonsense\nEverybody on the left and the right we all have an ego problem we're utterly convinced that our side is absolutely right and if you violate that if you violate one part of that you're a traitor you're a traitor to the race the party the cause whatever\nThey are wrong and we remain right now there are real true right and wrong but there is there is truth\nBut I don't think any of us are really looking for at least a large section isn't looking for it we are indeed living in interesting times\n\nBut he is ... is our crisis is our problem of them problem because that's what the world is trying to sell us I personally think it's an ... problem all of us both sides all of us and\nMaybe we don't see it because we're so busy staging and filtering and enhancing the colors on our Facebook or Instagram pictures that we can really no longer recognize what what\nIs true even about our own lives\nBecause everything that we print in post most of it is ally one way or another subtle or bold its ally\nAnd why is that\nBecause we'd been marketed to ever since we were born all of us if you were born after Nineteen fifty you were marketed to your whole life\nEspecially now it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse you are not complete unless you wear consume you own your vacation at or you don't buy product a or B\nYou're not complete you're not good

opinions now our products as well that you must embrace and where somebody else's not yours\n\nAnd now we're in the final stages where we ourselves are products companies like Google and Facebook and

marketers are trying to fill that in for you you buy this product and you can say I am cool where I Am in style I Am rich I Am smart you by Democrat\nAnd you can say I am compassionate\nYou by the Democratic label I Am smarter than others I Am science minded than it does it even matter if you really are doesn't matter if you've ever given a dime or given any time to anything just by buying this label you are compassionate\nIt's the label that everybody needs now if you want to buy Republican\nWell then you get to be patriotic guy unpatriotic I support our troops I support family values it doesn't matter if you're a whore in it every night if you're a ... by the Republican label you can say that by the Christian label and you can do whatever you want\nYou just use religion to excuse you

Fox News President Trump and the first lady touring areas of Florida and Georgia torn apart by hurricane Michael\nWhose brutal they haven't seen anything like it and the possibility that hasn't been in his life as the winds almost two hundred miles and this\nAnd I ended up going on one of these [laughter] hey\nHey or to publish open access journals that as apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned or was it was really fun fun right on that he misses\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway right [laughter] that [laughter] um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we\nTook the criticisms we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge like a\nCouple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a a financial racket going on there it's its own big problem and I hope people continue to\nAddress it a secondly we decided that um we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise] that would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and admitted that we were wrong but it's it's not what happened on\nAnd uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's on the recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and it's since he's been a recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took\nMaybe that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week um my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same as you talk to hell in the other day yeah\nUh so I this was an an immense amount of work it required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow\nYeah it's a lot of work\nIt was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and no one has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily\nHaving to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing author only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines I mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I ... is a\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to the university and say hey I got this many papers published if people are being considered her tenure there's a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process\nBut typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spend Fifteen some disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spans seven and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know un who you at twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end we not gotten cold\nOkay so when we come back we'll we'll go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA hand to hand article where they got a little gold star for [noise]\nAlright are a sponsor

objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the\nProgressive stack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it does not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just it says this is this an act says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah they're loaded argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a\nInventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility wants to determine how privileged they are the students are ranked according to their privilege\nUm then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class\nSo the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means they\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the way in the ... privilege classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being comforted and so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of the a feminist and race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrifying this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and then it kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly paper they claim for example that we grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on but um but the idea that\nThat giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to reach spoken over him interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\n\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published ... ... what would that\nMean to the university system would would want to send me and\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom and got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo they decided it didn't come to us\nOut of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some ... some ... uh educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics\nCourses I guess that's the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as\nYou know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journalist wasn't some fringe
