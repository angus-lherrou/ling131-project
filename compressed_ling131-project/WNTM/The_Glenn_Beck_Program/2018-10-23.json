E. Y.\nHas banner raised dot com sign up for their newsletter there and you'll also find ... cigar shop on ... on Facebook that's how bad a race cigar shopping lounge twenty three fifty one airport boulevard\nPasses off from reading your hands out and bring it with a guy who can vote on all wrong\nOn that in your home team from half about provide information\nFrom economic county border for less than what\nWe're back here on news radio seven ten W. N. T. M. with heads heating and air conditioning [noise]\nOne hand junior and Carlos ... are here with heads\nA and we started the hour talking about getting maintenance done for a variety of reasons of course this time of year I mentioned that I think about maintenance because I've got gas or a gas heating system and I think in terms of safety they don't want to make sure that I'm completely safe\nUm Carlo are important to get it done also before the first cold snap\nYes and in ... bill generally we have pulled out a jacket by the time we hit Halloween and thrown at on or kind of thought about it and by the time we hit Thanksgiving\nWe will have turned on our heater to use it to take the chill off or naturally keep from for you know getting too cold and the bottom line is a it is safe is to have that checked out prior\nTo using it initially\nUh if you do end up procrastinating are forgetting and then you do have to use it because that cold spell came in ah of course you'll probably do so but\nStill get it checked because it's important that it's safe to operate and that's with all systems not just the gas systems\nBut the gas systems we have more concerns with for safety and then the heat pumps and the straight electric systems but we recommend it for all of it it's not just for safety it's also for getting you good performance in keeping that equipment last thing and and uh extending its life\nUh so you don't have to purchase a new equipment prematurely\nSo when ... when we have our first really are below freezing few days how hectic does give\nIt up when I was fixing to talk to you say something about but uh when we get every time we get a good coach bill first good coach bill we're wide open and that's one of the reason we're saying check it out early because there's\nLots of people who haven't turned there's on or they don't use like me I go without heat a lot right and uh so I can I won't term on on until this is very very cold in an generally the kids were yelling at me\nAnd uh so then I'll go and turn the heat the heat bubble but\nWe swapped and we can't get to every body is fast and a lot of times when you start getting the the ... back up\nAnd uh so generally that'll happen like the first three or four good coal spells we'll get like that and then after that yeah we get a little busier but we're not swapped and uh\nBut so that's another reason why you want to check it out I haven't checked out before you get the first good cold spell and a cause that goes but when it's like that for us to like that for every body they're all getting those calls and everybody's running around trying to catch him\nOur service guys don't knock off at five o'clock ... they will work longer into the night and everything like that yes uh but there comes a point where you basically get run ragged and that's what happens to those guys and they are real troopers I have to commend them for their extra effort and everything yes but we do have to\nIt's a planned a little uh as homeowners in as people who want to be comfortable and take into consideration that there's only so many of those folks out there or service Texan guys and if you have something major\nThat has found like cracked heated exchange or or some other major repair that really doesn't make sense to fix it\nUh it takes a little longer to line up and get a replacement done or at least the next day or a couple of days depending on how many folks if like the in that predicament but the bottom line is that if you plan to head\nThat won't be done as an emergency type thing it'll be a minimum of inconvenience and\nUh it you'll get your best prices that way too\nAnd I'm just having regular maintenance done um it's also going to increase the lifespan of of all of it\nYes just like it does with your car with your body and knock at this stuff is uh if you treat it right it should last longer for you\nOkay so you can call heads heating and air conditioning and get the maintenance done to five or six five three seven eight seven three now explain how the the maintenance agreements work\nMight miss agreement should depending on how many systems you pass a certain rate and we come out twice a year would come out once in the spring or in the summer and in the fall sometimes you know depending on when they on schedule we have a lot of people will call 'em and\nUh they're they're busy at that time so they'll wait till the last minute but we've come out twice a year and check it out in the heat and check it out on a cooling and we perform or the the tests are talking about and look at your outdoor unit your refrigerator charges during the coup in season you all your electric connections and\nA will wash the outdoor cold indoor coal if that's dirty then that's a that's a price is outside of that we've got the price for that but a\nLot of things the plus you get a ten percent discount on many parts that you need a and you get priority service\nThat doesn't mean that you call in and we your next gal call because we have a lot a lot of maintenance agreement people and uh but we try to get you the same day and we'll take you before we take somebody who if you got ... no heat we're going to do those before we do a maintenance person\nOr two we'll try to move our stuff around ... take care of ya\nOkay we've got only a a little bit more than a minute left in the show one of ... more time uh about heads heating and air conditioning is going to take\nA a trucker to to Florida with supplies for the people that need help after the

journalist and the ... sky news reports body parts ... been found Fox assignment on your live on what Turkey's president is saying\nAnd do a play and the app store but it's the twenty first century version of Drudge Report it is for conservative video content um that's out there that's being pushed to the side and and hidden by these that company\nWhat platform you're keeping it all on what do you what do you I mean you're going to Google Play I mean you're going going right into the hands of the beast or what are you doing to ensure that they they aren't um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody else\nWell what we're trying to do because I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's going on with some running conservative content so we said you know if we can find all these great conservative publishers and say\nHey here's what we wanted to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play and the apple store but I think this is a sort of the first step to be able to counter\nThat suppression from YouTube and Facebook so who do you have on board so far so we have a conservative review we've talked to Breitbart made a great meeting with Prager you last week they're on board and obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time hearing of it but I Can't imagine we're not\nYeah so and what we're really doing is you know we're pulling the content from your Facebook page and from your YouTube so\nAh the blaze channel benefits because the view ... to you guys and the other thing that we wanted to do I'm In this where we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook and so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it\nAnd we'll work with our team in our network to make sure that um you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your content\nSo what do you think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um uh it is um [noise]\nUh this is something that I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives are just now starting to say\nHey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together um because they're starting to see the writing on the wall or in many different directions or so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who is trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices\nWhat do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we need a conservative Facebook\nNo we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean we need to be a if if it's known as a conservative thing only conservatives are going to go there\nSo how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first kick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with a swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the Capitol we talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this as a\nBernie Sanders ... light shared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this hum and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys name that was all about the contest\nAnd that's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really sweet mobile application makes it easier for people to interact with a contact\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in Brazil with a with a young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going\nYou know you can't sell that we can sell the libertarians two ... two older than you know\nAll this freedom talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to the the youth and they are making huge gains and headway because you know they're twenty somethings that have\nWho are are naturally attracted to freedom and said there's a better way to package this I think that's great and anything you're doing to encourage a you know twenty somethings to do that I think as time they take charge\nYeah I think so I think you know having the big conservative publishers on board um an does banding together you know with this program\nWe're going to find a lot of talented people out there who are you know frustrated who are amazing videographer isn't filmmakers who go out there and shoot this content um and let them be the bridge to reach the next a conservative or libertarian generation\nSo here the update dot com or let me let me I'm a switch topics with you because you know you have consulted a with candidates et cetera et cetera but do you think\nIs coming our way to places first blue wave red wave no way\nYou might as well flip a coin so I live I it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat and so you know I talked to a lot of guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said oh it's you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this\nBig national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media saying it's always about local that as a the Kavanaugh saying coupled with Cortez\nComing out and saying you know capitalism is not going to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think that Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bad\nYeah I was telling somebody earlier this week the orange he just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted Democrat I can you know continue to vote Democrat\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean these are radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was in ... district and these are we went to a machine shop neither lifelong Democrats a lot of them switched over to vote for President Trump\nBut I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I still you know identify as a Democrat voter so I just rattle off a couple of issues and I'm like\nThat I had to break into your man you're you're you're no longer for in this Democratic Party right so yeah it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out two weeks away\nHow do how do you think the president and ah the Republicans should respond to this caravan coming up stop it\nI mean I think the president's made it clear where their country of laws or not and it it you know the the ruse that they're using that this is\nUh it's amazing how well the left uses terminology to try to convey people to their side\nBecause now they're asylum seekers you know their asylum seekers or their asylum seekers you apply for asylum in the first country that you arrived to which would be Mexico so it's not about that it's about getting to the United states is about sending money back to their country uh I don't even\nKnow if it's about that these guys are\nThese guys are Marxist or that are upset at the the the the politicians in Honduras that kicked their Marxist a guy out who had ties to Venezuela and to Castro in Cuba\nThey've been trying to do all kinds of ... in in Honduras\nThere because they are carrying the Honduran flag that these guys are Marxist radicals at least the leadership\nIs I I Would have to imagine that if I was in a their situation if I was legitimately or refugee and I got to Mexico in Mexico was willing to hear my case or process me\nI Would wait in line for as long as it took the helm ... you know myself or my family for them to just break down the barricades and and charge the police officers in Mexico and say guys that you can't stop us we're going all the way the United states and right you know singing Honduras national anthem\nYeah it's this is about politics and who's funding them yeah it's a great issue but I'm\nThe president should stand strong and stop it if they make it that far [noise]\nAll right the or the name of the athletes launching went this week yeah launching this week you can go to the update dot com or\nGive his email address and we'll send you early access into this week when it hits both um the apple store and Google Play\nGreat thank you very much for coming by thinks alright it's ah the update dot com\n\nTime let me tell you a little bit about to American financing I'm I'm very concerned about something I'm going to sound insane\nShortage of dollars a there is a shortage of dollars coming and I know that sounds crazy because we we've been printing\nAll these dollars where are all these dollars well the problem is the government keep spending more and more dollars and the government is looking for people to buy our treasuries which is a giant loan with US dollars\nAnd so the more we spend the more dollars the government is gobbling up also because all of the banks took out loans in US dollars I'm Sorry not the banks of the other countries the emerging countries\nNobody's willing to look at that\nI don't know if you if you're a psychiatrist [noise] call me and tell me how I'm wrong on that but that cognitive dissidents\nHad to have played in a manger room or at least a big role\nMobiles news radio seven ten WN T.

I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's\n... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and ah the you know unbeknown to most people is Soros has dumped millions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing in so many of your listeners need to understand this is George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles\nAre two years ago he gave a ... million dollars or directly to candidates in Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that ... has\nFunded these ground game stick it out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your question and listeners think about this uh all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities in blue counties you have a Dallas year after year and you have San Antonio you have all that and you have El Paso and so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it so much harder for people who are conservative people are who are Republican to be able to\nCobble together the votes that are needed to make sure that we keep Texas the passion of freedom to bash them liberty or in the passion of conservatives and also a every vote counts in and we really need to get

I think you should all these things you are innocent until proven yet either Simon charges against Cory Booker one person making you know and then there's people making these things\nEvery ... every day up which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man and editors who we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them right um so you know that's the way I think you're supposed to head let's why innocent until proven guilty is a thing\nOr and I think with not only a Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism by the time these relationships break up and there's things said and who knows there's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing\nWhat would they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country believed Cavanaugh I should be you know I don't put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with so they don't care about it he can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations what's fascinating is that people have Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happens latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda wow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well known is on TV all the\nTime and he's she's credible she's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy\nDated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses\nThere's Dr reports at the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't write your phone into a bright just crazy yeah it's\nAn amazing wants to that one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they felt they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up a instead is forty three thirty six\nSo right now do we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go ah there's a if you're looking at right now a forty a four seats are that are safe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have to it's forty six excuse me forty effect\nIf you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes a Tennessee which is still\nVery close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though overall it looks like a Republican is still a head there are black burned and then in Texas still leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer than you did a few ... a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got to another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're going to be fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can pull off six of six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things past ah so\nYou know at that level of whether it's a I mean they could still lose it to they could easily still losing it's possible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six is is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that it's a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nThe election by numbers\nOn the waiting for a pro Arab or twenty third there is that going back program\nAll right when I take a break and we'll tell you about our spots and then we come back and I'm going to tell you about\nI mean there's a real problem and you haven't even considered it to really know well you know that which is er out putting ...

[noise]\nNews ... with that caravan of migrants heading north from southern\nMexico life president Mike Pence told President Trump in the oval office that the president of Honduras is blaming the caravan on leftist groups backed by Venezuela\nHe said criminals are among the group and it's likely to our middle Easterners President Trump says he may call it the military wants to care of ants closer Fox is Jessica Rosenthal Matthew Ginsberg ... with the Honduran solidarity network says the current time during president who's last election was disputed came up with a story to the U.S couldn't blame him for the caravan\nSo they're going to say oh well it's Venezuela to get the Trump Administration to focus on somebody that they already have a dislike for\nDemocrats accused the administration of politically motivated fear mongering calling the cover up one of the worst in the history of cover ups President Trump on the murder\nAnd just member event of a Washington Post columnist\nThe news you want to know caravans\nMillions you need to know who the hell all\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to ...\nSo let's talk about the caravan for a second because we really need to decide what we think about this and what we're going to do about it\nWhat do you think we should do about it and you need to have this conversation with all of your friends right now\nWhat do you call people Seventy five hundred who are political Marxist activists that's what they are political Marxist activist marching with the Honduran flag\nIn protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them is they're marching towards our border they're not refugees\nThey chose to leave their country they're finding their country\nThey were trying to get a do a political stunt\nSo what what are these people where did they get the money who's doing the supply chain how how do you even have the bathrooms services all along the way who's providing medical aid so it's not a death march you can't march\nTwenty five hundred miles and expect everybody to be okay and in good health when they arrive\nThings happen\nWhat who's providing medical aid who's providing the water who's providing the trucks that so far we haven't seen anywhere else we are\nSome yesterday on the news and why it matters in fact Sarah I don't know if we have this video\nBut if we could play this a video or if you have it\nThe the video of a these migrants being loaded up into giant semi trucks they're being trucked from place to place from photo opportunity to photo opportunity\nYou pointed this out there that I I didn't notice it initially but there's there's women walking with strollers\nAnd it's like well a stroller is not designed for a thousand mile walk down right like that's not how that happens in them or they're getting out there grouping up there ... for a couple of miles cameras get them then they get back in trucks and then get an injury that Dr\nLook at the ... video game ... video again please tell me how many women use spot climbing into the back of\nThe semi truck [noise] just count them even just count them\nAs of right now it's the uh well you know all of them counted right one all of them counted one ... one one and he said and by the way just to clarify you want you want me to individually point out the women that are women that are quite a big crowd but the women that you can see that the one there was an a on the um\n[noise] one ... okay now so this isn't women and children who are these people are\nWe know that MS MS Thirteen that now has embedded the people in to this group I mean now Seventy five hundred people\nAnd I want to play some audio uh this is ... let me see if I can get the right one uh yeah I think it's a\nI think it's CNN and Cuomo can you play this here on what the military is going to do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you put military down there we know what the God Forbid is in this situation\nHow was that good for anybody if cars you know you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that send who wins and\nBut I don't think they're going to wind up in the country a wreck and can I don't think that it has to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you have a must happen what do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in way worse for America can\nYes ... you're you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and it's a turn them away right there it's an invasion treated as an invasion turn way\nYou say there's an invading force these people they're not come anywhere lately\n[noise] now the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away and I want you to listen\nTo all of the people on television that are now saying\nWe are a country that is always had open arms to migrants we're always the country that I mean our our
