hear a lot of people in our area that like to use hardy board well hearty bored just like would has to be painted you know\nOver and over again every three every two to three years and that's that's what they advise so you're going to not only are you going to pay to have this hardy board or wood siding put on but you're going to continue to pay to have it plain signing as a one palm coast and that ...\nGoing to do the same thing it does every day for the next thirty eight years you see what I'm saying so ... it it is a it again it is a money saving product with the same loop and sometimes a much more elegant look then would sightings or hardy board\nOkay we've got a little less than a minute left in the show of course a window world for windows and doors and hurricane products and for

who's taking cheap shots of me a number of times over the years ... me because the Niro not one of these packages\nImagine him talking about the president wanting a punch the president in the face you would think CNN would agree with me that that's incendiary rhetoric for those that want to dream of blowing up the White House\nYou know this this is so close to slander this is right there on the line and I have my lawyers looking at it right now but as I Am not so over the top us things\nThat John Avalon would join me in saying Robert De Niro Z incendiary rhetoric of one punch the president is a threat to the president of the United states and Frank and that's something I think the secret service should have looked into\nBut I have a history of saying we ought to protect all presidents\nCheck out his Sean Hannity radio show later today\nAre right here [noise]\nHey if you or a loved one struggles with leg or foot cramps you gotta try that rewards for relief\nNow there's

works relief dot com missiles ...\nBut there's one interesting way of looking at this we talked to a lot about\nA district that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump the people who voted for Obama and then changed to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton\nAnd there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if the Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney in two thousand twelve and then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand or sixteen so two thousand twelve on average squirting five thirty eight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nAnd two thousand sixteen it with a five point advantage for Democrats\nSo what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now\nUh we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states\nSo if you look at it kind of ... just summarize those that kind of lost three points are well well the three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate didn't did you do that and sixteen but a big big move from two thousand twelve done it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand direct team\nNow they were Twenty one district that voted for Barack Obama and then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one\nOr so in two thousand twelve with Rocco bomb on they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama or in two thousand sixteen that's swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs it you would think of these real swing districts so far polling is showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points that's big the big change to it and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting roam around ... so if you look at that the people who were\nVoted for a bomb and then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Brock Obama when Romney\nOr the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton\nThey're in between those two positions but leaning towards Clinton [noise]\nThat's where these districts show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive states or Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for all bronco Obama been changed to Trump in the Obama election that had about five point advantage for Obama and those states in the Trump election there is about to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing eight twelve point advantage for Democrats now now that part of that it's\nIt's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWe're this is some of these races are just they're so popular Democrats already Pennsylvania's like an example of that where they have been just a big lead or not because I don't think that's necessarily solely because of some switch like soldiers settled ... tell me what all this means from last week\nOr the Democrats making is is the momentum start just they're just starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say it doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is [noise]\nThere was an I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers aren't showing that I mean it right now wait ... seems like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid in the Senate right now when will we see\nAny movement at all are due to the shooting in the bombing [noise]\nWell the polling wouldn't even start probably if you want real polling reaction that at least till today so you have three I mean you're probably not till later this week Thursday or friday the early okay I Will look for the [noise]\nThe election by numbers [noise]\nOn the Glenn Beck program [noise]\nThis weekend or as you know a gunman opened fire at the tree of life synagogue and Pittsburgh he shot and killed eleven people during Sabbath services injured six others for where police officers the guy was insane\nHated Donald Trump that doesn't make him a Democrat\nDoesn't mean that he was you know following I dunno Cory Booker whoever it just means this is not political\nAnd should it be we keep jumping to politics first I Can't imagine what these families are going through\n\nPennsylvania has taught us before with the Amish how to deal with killers\n\n[noise] if you've been listening to me um for a long time you know what I Believe is coming and have said is coming for a while and I'm always wrong with timing but I don't think there's any way to deny that what I've\nWorn was coming is here now we're seeing the beginnings of it now\n\nAnd it's only going to get worse and it's going to get harder it's going to get harder for you to stand up\nIf they take an gab down yet I think the\n... the service provider for them has taken them down or I don't know if they're back up as Afghans fault gap is that it's a kind of a shorter a\nCompetitor I guess I Would say that they found up are becoming a\nSafe haven for anti Semite so I guess an ... and you know\nI don't want that nobody wants that but we either believe in freedom or we don't and yes I don't I don't like the poison that they put out\n\nBut I also don't like the silencing of voices this America man this is American principles you can't silence voices\n\nSky was deeply disturbed really bad guy\n\nYou know you watch TV and you see the victims the faces curling across the TV screens\n\nAnd you might think that things are getting worse\n\nAnd I guess historically speaking this is the worst anti Semitic shooting we've ever had in the history of our country eleven people\n\nOn the positive side that's nothing compared to some countries\n\nI saw some reporters say you know the problem is is a this is Donald Trump I Hope you I Hope you're happy that do you have your uh your synagogue or I'm Sorry your ah your embassy in Jerusalem really really that's where you're going\nReally this was caused by moving the embassy to Jerusalem oh my gosh\n[noise] wow\n\nYeah Jews were killed in Israel like terrorists last year a hundred and twenty two hundred and twenty two is that Donald Trump's fall too or is that just the evil Jews full how many of France\n\nFrance they're moving out at a record number because they know they've seen this

because of the Bible let 'em have it it's uninhabitable it's it's just nothing but a desert there's no oil there's nothing there just gave it to them\nAnd the Jews happily took it restored to their

Israeli exists because they have a right to live\n\nSo let me go back to Russia and our musical friend in\nNineteen eighty nine forty years after the battle of Stalingrad the Hebrew immigrant aid society was helping Jews get out of the Soviet Union and go to Israel and to the United states and they provided lawyers money to find homes food even language classes to help them assimilate in their new country\nFor the first time ever\nGregory and the rest of the Jews that he had known that had survived both Hitler and style and couldn't concentrate on something more than just surviving\n\nThey had a right to pursue their happiness they could practice their faith they could be proud of who they were they could finally live\n\nThe group that saved him the Hebrew immigrant aid society it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world let me say that again it's the oldest refugee assistance organization in the world\nIt was established in the Eighteen hundreds and they're

Jewish\n\nReason why I'm telling you the story is this is the organization that I'm mad man went into Philadelphia to try to stop this is the organization that was attacked on Saturday morning at the tree of life synagogue\nStory never seems to end the eleven people were killed and the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history\n\nStories like Gregory filled the synagogue that Saturday morning\n\nThe horrors that collectively endured unimaginable to most people\nAnd yet here we are again the group of people\nWho now have to concentrate just on one thing\nSurvive\nAnti Semitism is

really I really had a difficult time uh I mean I just\nDid you guys watch the news all this week you know as little as possible I write a little bit because of the shooting 'cause I get the updates but yeah yeah so only to get the updates and stuff I I don't know who's watching cable news anymore yeah\nI I never watch cable news never mind the highlights I get the clips but I don't I don't actually sit there and watch Fox\nNews can't or oh the in in heaven forbid and MSNBC or CNN jet why don't you don't want to lose I don't know who's doing that they do I really don't know who's your fans was box\nYou know 'cause uh it's a safe haven mostly unless you're watching Shepard Smith\nUh [laughter] but it's always been that way but I don't know I'm just\nCNN I don't know who does 'cause that's\nSon watch all the people who hate Trump ... yeah I guess the only reason I ever turn any of that stuff on it sort of the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly out\nIf I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would listen to them talk about early do down the synagogue thing is he's oh literally it's quite ... comedy questions that is until they can get to a question about why Trump's Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of very slowly but surely but he's like you know did he he didn't go there to help with today is the first question was ah you know\nBut what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country as a Jew where I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator\nI I was I was a winning senator and a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt them and anti Semitism my entire life\nHe he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah this is a terrible tragedy then they're like well what what what part of of that do you think is is the the climate\n... of today and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear that this shooter a outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah we did not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't tie him to it yet but more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment\nBut it has nothing to do with this and all these cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us to blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight now is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie than ever that guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot all of the geo ... and another guy and tried to try these trained to kill thirty Republican heat\nThat's tenth of the Republican paint on was working for Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault no we never said that and neither did I say and either do today yes of course not they didn't even talk about it because they had a very\nBalanced view of that one re understood that individuals were responsible for their own actions that time bus ride a understood that then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them and and they always complain about this course isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes\nWe can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the pipe bomb think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt 'em but you know we did see that ah with\nWith the Bernie Sanders situation but both situations we said the individual is responsible the discourse is is is an interesting aside because\nOverall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individual shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not you'd ... discourse does not commit murder\nDoesn't happen so the reason why Rob ... this morning is because uh you know or he sees doing more on trivia and uh and porridge trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nYeah it's it you know it's a chance to get away from the discourse for a little wire like an hour a week as and just be me and yeah and just be mean to\nSo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know and that when I'm never going to bend on that one\nAnd in fact repeated a ... consistently just repeat it and it was fabulous and again it was it you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nThank you thank you so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's on Sunday becoming\nNo because we're going to be out of town is going to be out of town really 'cause I already free tickets but seriously oh now all of sudden you're in it can change I get you change your plans I've got free tickets for if you want if you'd like them\nAre you serious I Am serious goes my ... that that would I change my plans okay All right All right good thanks Suzie we'll see you are\nWhat ... Sunday or at least ... I think this\nSunday yes it's going back to accomplish tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ... it's going to be fun there's a lot of election stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff you have given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the ... turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nSaid it does and a Pittsburgh\nWe've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and and comedy but uh also uh I Am a taking all of\nThe proceeds from the I'm from the event and um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to the uh the refugee I'm Down here a group I'm not sure we're going to give them to yet but we're we're\nUh we're we're standing with Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um\nTo a a local Jewish um\nCenter perhaps the synagogue and I'm not sure and I sense from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I noticed he went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever consider a criticized I think it was George Soros stream into a and I remember and you came back to this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know\nAnd then she posted here's an example a ... supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros or as as an example of how much you hate the Jews\nNow I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard a that was a\nNational award one of the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh it was just it was just presented by the the prime minister of Israel though\nWell that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of bed a cloud of big one so it's just amazing you know because this is not just a criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a ... a conservative\nAnd the people in this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them will criticized George Soros but they criticize him because he's a liberal or progressive policies he supports\nA policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him more rounded him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history or around the world that but\nAnti Semite patriarch source to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew or the way they don't\nLike fish Shapiro because you have written hero importing policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew now but because\nHe came up with the idea of communism\nI'm not a fan no not a fan of\nFat and the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized Ben Shapiro before is that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like within Shapiro said they will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal and they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people\nCan you really not understand I mean we all know cannot do it and I it's not all understand\nThat they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives they're anti Semite we you're telling me the way they uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who was one of the biggest finance here's the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\nOver it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas is legal opinions because they don't support what they believe it's not about it it is trying to make these into cartoon arguments which is such a a ... ... again\nThis is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're killing everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they\nSay it anyway because they don't care\nThat that that is exactly what they they they claim to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear solution there too

number is even higher but I'm not sure people actually mean this\nI'm not sure what unity even means they say that we no longer really uh agree\nOn the core values of our country which I think is actually true we don't agree on core values but what are those core values\nAnybody know what\nAre the values that brought up what are the things that were actually arguing about now way things are

a ...\nPercentage that say Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen Percent\nFifteen Percent of us they were United on the most important values my question is\nWhat are those values sincerely what are we fighting for our we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's the surveys the shows where we divide on our quote the most important values\nPolitics in this country it's politics of value um moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value race relations\nGap between rich and poor the state of the news media the way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state rights for algae beat the status of religion\nHomeland security with an exception of a couple of those aren't\nValues those are issues that is a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing\nSee I I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted outrage we\nHave a few things we have to decide we have to decide one so western world war saving is freedom as our founders saw it is it worth saving yes or no\nAnd I don't want you just uh you know jump off and yeah absolutely\nWhy why why is it worth saving who can articulate this why is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics\n\nWho can make that case among us who's making that case to their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place\nWe have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half the country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place\nWhich are we sincerely which are we we have to choose don't wait because it's a binary choice is in it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one no no you don't\nIt's not a binary choice the answers were both\nWe're both we've been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell is paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone\nActually make the case for America and not just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\n\nWhy is the constitution were fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it man let's just move on\n\nI I'm I we cannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our basic essential values in line\nLike climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat\nThe earth okay that's a value that's on climate change\nClimate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem\nIs there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the ice age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nThe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion and ... in the scientific field\nYou give me clean cut studies okay\n\nBut that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it see they keep making a about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nWell the solutions are insane the solutions don't work now that is a political discussion that is a political discussion you know where our values come in on that particular discussion when someone says the scientists settled is shut up\nThat's a violation of our values\nWhen people sit down at the table and say look I care about the environment I really do I disagree with the science and here the people on my side that are showing you that this is ... this this collusion\nAnd that yours yours system that you're you're you're you're you're touting is nothing more than a political system and it doesn't work\nThat's a political discussion those are the things we should have what brings us together at the end\nOr the values\nWe both care about the earth who doesn't care about the earth sincerely who doesn't care about the earth and I'm tired of being lectured by people who will go and protest and leave us see of garbage buying them for others to keep and clean up\nI'm sick of it don't tell me you care about the environment and then after a protest everything is not about later\nYou either care about it or you don't words don't mean anything anymore only actions do\nDon't tell me what you believe show me what you believe my\nWhat
