{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "That is the not probably I Would say the number one reason is because people are afraid to commit eight or nine hundred dollars a month\nThose quotes on a Monday paying a thousand dollars a month\nThousand dollars a month for health care that's a lot of money that's a lot of money for somebody on a fixed income and that's a lot of money for somebody that is retiring that early to be shelling out now even let's say they're retiring at sixty they have five years of you know\nOf paying for their own um health care contract before Medicare kicks in but that's something that's that's one of the biggest um hindrance is that we find that is one of the biggest things to get over and there are some people that are lucky enough like um you know retired teachers\n... and things like that they keep the cost down for them but it it is not the case for many people and\nPeople think that would be okay sixty five now got Medicare\nAnd it's going to be free it's going to be free and it's not free\nPart a is free because you're paying for part a right now or later it comes out of your paycheck every two weeks\nShe hasn't done that for you just take prepaid [laughter]\nNot free but when you look at what it costs if you've done well and you say blood and you've got a lot of you've got a very attractive income in retirement more income you have the more you're going to pay for part the Port Said part D you know all the different things\nYou can be paying as much as three hundred three hundred and fifty dollars a month for your supplemental Medicare in retirement and that's a lot [noise]\nThe biggest cause of bankruptcy the fastest growing group of\nThe demographic group of people filing bankruptcy in the United states are senior citizens and the number one cause is the cost of health care and the number one expense and as far as health care for seniors is the cost of long term care\nVery few people when they come to see us have made arrangements are made plans for how they're going to pay for a long term care we're having more and more people that that know about it because the baby boomers have had to take care of their parents and they asked how much it cost and I know how much you call it ... it\nWasn't something that ... most people never heard of it I'm Thirty years ago\nRight the the people even either know how much it costs to put somebody in an assisted living facility or nursing home or have somebody come in and take care of them or they know that they couldn't the parents couldn't afford it and they had to take it they had to take on the ... we have clients that have built on\nAdded on rents their hands just to take care of their parents and they don't want to do that to their kids and so whatever it may be they want to make sure that taking care of\nYeah I've got uh some ... some of the bay right now where the wife has has been having somebody to come in and help take care of her every day [noise] um and now the husband has gotten sick they both have long they have we made provisions about eight or nine years ago for long term care\nBut they're spending right now they're spending almost Thirteen thousand dollars a month\nFor the care to come into their home fortunately we've got taken care of we've got that kind of income coming in in addition there are other income because when people have to have somebody come in and help take care of them or you know nobody wants to go to a nursing home even though we've got some very nice ones and mobile and bone county is still going to cost twenty five thousand seven thousand dollars a month\nFor care in a facility and it can be more if you're taking care of in your own home\nBut if you're being taken care of in your own home you having to pay these people this money and you still have the expenses of the house yet you still have to eat you still have to pay the power bill you have to pay the taxes and all kinds of things\nSo if we can make provisions in one or two of our buckets than we lay out in the plan to give you that increased income\nThat will not be taxable income you know we restructured so it's the attacks advantage then we can have those type expenses that that survey that you were talking about with a nationwide yes a senior couple with have prescription drug cost and that's one of the big he's\nA couple that are between that time a sixty five and their death if they've got a lot of drugs they're taking\nThan they are going to be out of pocket over and above what Medicare ... three hundred and Seventy thousand dollars that's a lot of money no kidding in addition to your regular living expenses rice you know some of these drugs nowadays fortunately we have access to them but it's a very big cost\nNow they're part of that said he said nationwide said that they don't even know that uh apparently of this study twenty seven percent of\n'em I flew an older adults told nationwide they couldn't cover more than a thousand dollars of unplanned expenses over an hour on a monthly basis I'm an only sixty percent can cover on five thousand dollars or more that that\nThere's not a lot of wiggle room and those ... now you know these people that study\nMoney if people on a fixed income like that that you know that\nThat's very important sit down and have a plan laid out and said that we can look we've been doing this\nA long time ago Henry almost a hundred years as you know so we kind of know what needs to be incorporated into a plan there's an ad on TV for for an insurance can we know a lot 'cause we've seen a lot yeah you know that I had\nA we have seen a lot over the last Ninety seven years Ninety seven years we've seen a lot of the mistakes that people have made and we see a lot of the things that are what we call bumps in the road that we need to\nMake people or at least open their eyes to think about what's going to happen is\nWhat's gonna happen if we're not going to we're not gonna try to solve the problem we don't have we're going to try to do is make provisions just in case we have a problem down the road without affecting your regular lifestyle you don't have to do that you just need to make plans provisions in Europe plan\nAnd the key to that is you have to have a plan and the plan is laid out by a U.S two pages to pieces of paper very simple where your buckets need to be and how much income those buckets that can produce and for how long and the end result is what is the legacy benefit was going to be passed on to the next generation or to charity or whoever you want it\nTo go to where we're almost out of time here uh one quick question are you talking about long term care and how important that is\nIf somebody has waited and they don't have it and they get into the early sixties or they're still options for somebody that eight oh yeah they're they're still options of for people up and they're a seventies and eighties there still are like oh yeah\nYeah we can build into a provisions into a planned this this book that we're talking about tax free retirement yes it talks about that and we'd get class that have\nPut provision this book talks about\nEr into their plan that ah allows to you know tax free is always good tax deferred is the next Best Buy and then taxable you know sometimes we have to take tax money are re money in that type thing right now are the lowest tax brackets we're in some time to make some plans is now\nThe next the next four to seven years we need to make plans okay we're

T. three mobile [noise]\nOn a magical destruction across the Florida Panhandle I'm Dave Anthony Fox News homes are gone\nBusinesses are gone governor Rick Scott one of the towns obliterated Mexico beach ... focus\nOf three or four days we've found the stock market you're right about that and and uh and so I'm like but I remain pretty bullish um look at the dollar is down down to twenty five thousand four hundred oh it was up or you know well over twelve hundred points higher than that a week ago\nUh I like to buy these steps but um you know you look at the fundamentals of the U.S economy with the tax cuts the deregulation that high unemployment I I'm Still I'm Still really high on the U.S economy I'm Still high on the stock market especially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what's the scoop did\nWell good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was the fed and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly move people out of stocks and bonds because when interest rates rise then\nBonds are more attractive relatively than stocks I'm usually those effects of of ah\nFat changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to see a long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we dollar shave real signs of inflation although energy prices are rising but you know bother commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling and price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to that says\nTo the fed and and a germ drawn Powell lie you take a punch bowl away from this party just when it's getting boring and I tend to I tend to think\nThat he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just because the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to squash shows a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you is even you know I'm an inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation novel evolution watcher guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and the tax breaks and we haven't seen it\nWe show me the inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong and I'm\nA I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but I did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we are international trade we have um\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper over time and that trade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I I my only point is I just think the fed acted preemptively and prematurely and raising rates\nIn in a in a way that wasn't that search I Am a little concerned by the way I go on about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like a quibbling a four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why is it going up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nYou they're saving sooner you they're not ... yeah maybe I didn't hear what you just said okay why I'm a why did why why is oil going up\n[laughter] that's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the um [noise] in the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um\n[noise] you know about the price uh in the global reduction and suppliers results\n... bring Texans Baca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nOil prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it plan I mean I don't know where you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick stick on the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next\nYear or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nBig problem right now it's just here you know that's the stock market is driven by fear and greed\n[laughter] that's true is up for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and and by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred I said to my wife funny let's let's take some of these profits and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me [noise] um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale but the last president that I heard really take on the fed [laughter]\nWas Ronald Reagan and uh we had Nineteen percent interest rates right shortly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's\nIt's it's a a you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week on why the\nPresident is the chief executive officer of the country right he's the one who was supposed to\nHelp manage our economy he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct but I I think there's a lot of one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or uncles on high at the fed they act as if they're the temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence\nBut they've made so many mistakes so you mentioned I remember the seventies as you do when we had literally twenty percent mortgage interest rates that was all because of fed mistake and I you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in\nTwo thousand seven and they all yet I keep thinking these people are somehow like jobs like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the\nUh the NAFTA replacement\nOr and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars a and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think is it Stephen [noise]\nThat's what he really fundamentally believes that terrorists are good\n[noise] here's my view I and I've talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new\nTrade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I Know trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of apocalyptic view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals you got to deal with Mexico he played candidate like a federal here or he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before that\nThe deal had to be seal candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and this is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with that I don't know you and I haven't talked about this plan but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheated\nOr stealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an electoral property they're building up their military they're like you know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics they're using on so I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nUh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction when it comes to China they let\nMe challenge beyond that whenever I uh you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way chop looks at it and I think he's right about that it's like if we can't trade with China we sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't their ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets\nMean damn near everything you buy and Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that courage and saying look\nWe're not gonna give you unfettered access to our markets\nIf you're not going to play by the rules I talked to a company CEOs all the time if I knew basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market you got to give up ownership of your company has to give up your trade secrets ... I mean we can't live without up his right eye right when he says look I didn't start this trade deal this trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also weren't believe they also weren't our bank at the same time I would feel better about it\nHey Stephen quickly one quick question for you and you probably have a real insight on the ah the we were kind of talked about the steel tariffs and these things going on a allies\nAre like Canada in ... as a way of negotiating a bring these contracts at the table for what was kind of like a ... a NAFTA two point oh type of situation\nThat happened but the steel tariffs are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change in any point\nBut this is what are the issues that I find my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy lyric I thought so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum terrorists or auto terrorists but especially not steel aluminum\nBecause you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto but we've got six million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum and what they produce I was over it and how is your Bush a\nCouple of weeks ago they you know when they make a you know\nBudweiser they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans\nAnd they showed their prices are going up and you're judged that's going on around the country our auto producers autos are more expensive because the steel chairs so my point to proposition even creating factory jobs are going to lose factory jobs as a result of that so I disagree very strongly with steel and aluminum tariffs I think they do more harm than good does\nWere winning were winning commonsense is winning it doesn't feel like it but that's just because the power structure that you're used to is no more\nAnd when you look at what's happened and you look at the Democrats saying things that they're saying now that you know Eric\nEric Holder today the latest is you know when they go low we ...\nThat that's that's not an\nAmerican principle that's not the way we should

wait wait wait yeah so you just kind of Iraq by surrounding the last Jedi by [laughter]\nThe last yet ay nice in the low hanging target being a star wars movie what do people care about more than

emotional\n'em and personal issues on social media it's not just about politics and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump can be about ...\nThe national anthem that can be about something out of celebrity status and an amplified sort of turned up to eleven so that people get really heated about it Star Wars is in that category too and there might be some evidence to show that this is actually happening every day\nGives me the evidence this is incredible\nYeah so it's it's circumstantial in many ways but that by nature of what we're dealing with here when you're talking about foreign influence and particularly\nMalicious activity coming from the Russian ... or ... or ... pop it accounts you were talking about a a moving target people who are deleting they're out changing their information making new account\nStaying active so that they can't actually be attracted to it and given location and if Morton ... researcher at us he could prove definitively that these are Russian agents than he should be working at the CIA but he's not he's just a researcher at USC and what you look at is you look at the characteristics of\nSocial media accounts on line conduit to I what I just mentioned is what behaviors did engage in debate speak in all caps what words they use and then as they are out there the next week when you look them up again these are sort of things\nThat you look for when you're talking about foreign influence on line and that might be Russian that might be the Chinese it might be Iranians or it might be some Floridian with a bone to pick with the rest of the country\nBut that so what did they plan to limit what they plan to into our society\nWell in this case what they planted 'em there was evidence that there were sixteen account that could specifically any Russian linked\nA hundred and five that sort of had a question mark as to where they could be originating from that are\nJumping on line when the last Jedi comes out and people are starting to debate about the movie and then they start throwing in the ... about the ... not the admiral admiral hold though and then they start rolling in tweets about how a masculinity is under assault because

thing blended that that comes from real people chew and you can't really distinguish what comes first like chicken or the egg did that did the Russian you know ... or ... on line plant the spot in a conservative or you know activist or Star Wars fan on line and then they sort of echo it\nOr did it go the other way around um because it is reasonable to look at Star Wars and see some sort of like

you say that it doesn't have a ... that it's not saying worrisome in art but I Would consider literature art as well\nAnd this is this is now how we are being taught that we have to read literature that uh we read it through the lens of oppression white male European oppression\nUm even if the even if the author is saying no no that's not what the story is about but it's not\nThe author is not even the the last word on this is the the post modern is they can take and read that tax any way they want correct\nI mean I think that they like contagion because that that probably ... to ... out of

science and reason them period the empirical evidence\nUh and and even I mean to you when you hear people say mathematics is racist this is because we're there trying to deconstruct anything that holds\nThe modern world together is that correct\nYeah that they they think that it has been constructed I'm saying is that a lot of voices has been left out and this relates somehow toilet technology
