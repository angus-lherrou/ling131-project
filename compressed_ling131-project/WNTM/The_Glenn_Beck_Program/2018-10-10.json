{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WNTM", "content": "It is a lot of the stuff we're encountering now is a nice homes that were built you know early to thousands um\nAnd unfortunately you know as if all electronic equipment there's things just start to go out so\nThat we're getting a whole wave of these uh audio systems that are pretty much full home audio but they're fourteen or so years old and [noise]\nThere's [noise] you know we've looked in ... on our wheels on a lot of replacing parts and it's just hardly not stuff out there any more for it so what are we doing a lotta overhaul and on that type stuff coming up\nFor sure everyone wants to control it with their phone or some type of ...\nOr a nice remote it's easy it's all about ease of use and in some type of ... control so we're kind of trying to take everything to to that level and every situation is different on what is going to take care of what we have to add or get rid of and replaced to to get it to that point\nYeah the ... system a I've got it on my phone right now and I can go to a I can\nJust let me play I can play from ... radio I can play from all these other different services you can integrate so many different things off you that one system without having an actual\nUsed to think of the stereo system the speakers where one part and then you had or what you played CDs on and all that\nIt's a it's so different now the technology and so much more convenient\nIt is in the ... the receiver does still exist and it does have a lot of packs a big punch and has a lot of technology built in it but it's not for everyone yeah if you own a\nFew on a full blown theater room and I want yeah bakers everywhere then\nWe still need to look at it that option because we need some amplification for for the speakers but you're right\nI mean for a certain situations porches patios a dense something simple that sounds great it those options exist in before we always had to go to the other route when a lot of cases it could have been overkill\nNow the sound bar the basic subtle sound bar itself isn't that an amazing piece of technology but it just I never would have dreamed that it could sounds so good coming out of that one thing\nIt packs a punch sure sure yeah I'm a as night and day or just listening to your normal TV and turn it on and then if you if you really want the full experience and not totally one hundred percent recommend it you've got to add the sub I'm\nWell thanks to another level I Would like to have it I don't have it what I've got it I Would like to uh\nYou know I was the last Wednesday ... like they can get look at getting ah the one we talked about before it's called a a beam which is a smaller version of what you have yeah because I Do have a traditional system in my family room does still sound really good and I want to keep\nA so maybe in the bedroom it's this much smaller versions so to put that what you have in my bedroom I think would be a bit of to me a bit much so now I have another option I did do that it's a [noise]\nIt's ... I'm always getting told to turn it down [laughter] and I can I can tell and [laughter]\nEven though I Know I can control the Soto sound system on my smartphone and I think it also has a remote although I don't I don't use the remote I can also have Alexa a turning on and off\nFact Alexa can turn on and off the television as well right so everything is talking to each other\nIs is nice to know that these new things hitting the market they're making them\nCompatible with the ... stuff well another thing about Alexis if you want us to do it I I don't know if we've\nTalked about that before I didn't maybe a newer I I just came in front of if you had a lecture or not or the Amazon Echo or diet but\nWe can set that up for you to tell it to turn the security off as well all I didn't know that we can do granite to just you can say you know elect to turn on you know you can command so it it's compatible with it\nSo this is this is just like security in that when you go into somebody's home you you really try to meet their needs you don't go come in with the with one size fits all\nYeah you're exactly right total opposite we it's a blank slate when we walk into someone's home\nThat's when we start we want we want to customize it around their wants and needs you give us a budget and we can make it we can make it work for you\nEvery day every single day is is honestly a new adventure for us if we've done a hundred jobs not one of those were like the other\nRight now the job you did for me on audio and video was just that one room\nHow many people want you to do an entire house\nOr a a lot uh I mean what are the options there we can take what you have with that so notion we can just get room by room we can customize each room how we want to do it someone says you know I'd like a couple of those sitting above my\nA cabinet send the kitchen or you know I'd like to sit on the counter or you know what I don't want to see him I Want him in the civil and so we have a device that Senate snakes that we can run the speakers into so we can just take it room by room customize it at the end of the day they can\nHave an apple like you have and they can have five six seven eight rooms and they can play 'em altogether play individually play different sources are different you could be playing Pandora\nAnd your kitchen is someone could be in your back porch play in a you know Amazon Music or whatever [noise]\nUh so it really has a lot of ah individual control volume good show and that's what people want the last thing they want is\nIs to go into a room and be able to play music but they have to run back to the receiver or whatever piece of equipment to change channels a volume and all those kind of things so that's what makes that experience so nice one\nThe other things that makes the experience so nice is that the way your installers install so that there is a minimum of any kind of cables are wires or anything like that if it can be hidden it is\nThat's we pride ourselves on the you're totally right\nUm we want to give them a different experience than\nOf the big box stores out there that might have a we don't give you that then you advice and now\nI mean if you can't if we can give you that than just go to go to the store and buy it and just get some my handyman to put it in and or or go get it yourself and put it in if you feel like you can do just to get a job so we don't want you to think that way we want to be done with it and we want you to say man you know\nThat would have taken me hours or or I'm Glad they did it I Love the job so that's what so important and gives us we think relevant see and and what we're doing\nIt helps to have somebody that's that's installed it in those all of it to go over with\nBrought up a good point and if I can say this real quick so as a lot of things became wireless ... in some things that customers could install I was scared that\nYou know years ago I'm thinking man you know is this going to be kind of it just out of the business here\nI mean you know as this technology changes what I've found is were needed more than we ever have ever been needed because we it has to do some serious technical\nProgramming a making all these things work were needed more now than than ever it's such a such a the need has changed dramatically so my thinking was was wrong way ... well and we're\nAnd the ... the asylum arms and audio for security for your home or your business check with the bay are the their the local company that does an outstanding job [noise] and also for your your audio and video needs\nCSI alarms and audio dot com [noise]\n\nThis is John McNeil mobile bay financial solutions tear immobile nothing is more\nThey helped us Gulf Coast neighbors manage\nNeeds of our neighbors have changed\nGive us a call ... six six six five\nSaying in the stands or he is he's a guy that we had books last hour and a guy\nKind of went in a different direction but I did it fits right in to what we had been talking about today I had a caller uh about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we're going to fight back\nAnd\nWe should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the true and steady we have to speak truth do not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are true\nTo be civil and kind to one another but we were\nNot at a place where I think he grabbed a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books that outrage kind of a nice time you can talk about outright\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to do diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen that before in my lifetime you know rage and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage when I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate your responded\nA and mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean that just said I'll just say I'll just say it you know dance response or the way a lot of people feel\nRight I Know you are there's a lot of built up\nOutrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups\nRather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ... and that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were\nThey wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a wry reality ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not every day we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation has face their challenges\nBut this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats we observe new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now the views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe\nA better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven and ultimately I don't think that's the path that I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way\nAnd you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed I think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is\nAnd the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around to the American woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean when you said you fight but you fight or a you know for example or you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're user titled were addicted to outrage right now\nAnd I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do well even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly to not participate in creating photo and falls crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically\nWere winning I mean look at the Supreme Court ... Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president that would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways ... you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going\nOut in and you know a trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because it they're desperate we're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\nWell I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a there's a difference\nBetween the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the gold those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just telling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much\nLike them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talked about this a lot in Christians in the age of outrageous is to I used to hold a biblical worldview\nBut then to engage the world with a win some approach and and and gun for what's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey\nAs well and I think it really challenge a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all just strategically you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and our art type has always been Moses and Jesus\nWe take Jesus and Moses out who are we modeling remodeling who are we striving to be we cannot forget our our type back in just a second\nFirst let me tell you about ... a President Trump has been a warning about the risks to every American if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress this November we will see an impeachment proceeding that does not mean that they will remove him from office but they will impeach him\nA the ... the the first chance they get if they win the house if they win the house and the Senate you're gonna see gridlock you're going to see nothing really nothing good\nAs slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christians who I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you I'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're gonna come on Sunday and kill you\nOr if you don't submit and we're going to crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nWe understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they live ... because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nWell we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this in the book and he he actually he's called the apostate goes you know Victor is right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes 'cause he's so angry about trying to hold back the advance of course that he's a pagan\nAnd he says this a while the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these in pious galleons empire ... not only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their about by\nThe name of the book is the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage pick it up meat is well worth the read\nInformation power use radio sim intent W.
