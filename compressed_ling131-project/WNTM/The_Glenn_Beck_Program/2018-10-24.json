know that's not what it is\nIt's not what it is and it appears more and more that that's not what this is either Jason\nRight and this is something that it's kind of amazing when you look at how the

this out long before anybody else even started catching on\nLike you were the first one I think this was like two and a half weeks ago or something like that\nThey said wait a minute who are these

the former a head of state for Honduras who was\nA surprise surprise uh Iraq Obama said was a coup well no it was the Supreme Court\nThat said of Honduras that said the president is is acting unconstitutional he is trying to change the constitution so we can have a military state under his rule\nSo the Supreme Court said arrest him and kick them out right that that's that's what happened that's what happened now they're unhappy about that now can you tell me a little bit about all the because most people don't know about\nAll but yeah so when a that that the net now deposed leftist Marxist a president when when when he will just before he was deposed he was working on with the Venezuelan in Cuba this massive like I Want to call it like a European Union a type alliance within

supposed to be the check to us or to rise up in South America and right and um yeah our American\nAnd they were to have their own currency um I don't know about maybe military uh agreements would have ... possibly could have followed I mean there were big plans for this I also want to point out that one of the key observers like an international minolta agreements trade agreements you have like he outside observer than\nI'm One of them their main one was Iran who is also a a an ally ally of Venezuela um keep that in mind that lay on this discussion when we talk about possible people who are

maybe that makes them uncomfortable but I think also from an ideological perspective it makes it easier for people to argue that you can identify whatever you want because it's a little bit trickier I think\nMost people still have the ... the common sense to know that biological sex is immutable show\nTo argue for say something like transgender rights it becomes helpful for them to say well maybe it's not about ... biology it's about gender which is you know they say it's a social construct or whatever which isn't that it makes it a little bit easier to argue that okay someone to weigh someone's field may not necessarily the link\nTo their biology but not sure if that really speaks to the point you're making\nSo but it was can you explain what gender does for is\nRight so the feeling that someone feels more alignment with the opposite sex than their first sex someone with a born male but they feel more ads do they fit in the female role\nOkay how has gender just for a a been embraced is gender just for you a good thing or a bad thing\nOh I I think it's seen as I don't think it should be seen are good as good or bad I think it's a medical condition and I think people who are suffering should be able to have access to care\nAnd I think adults should be allowed to transition if that's the best approach for them but I think nowadays it's kinda glamorize and seen as something that is really um almost\nPrefer not ... but it's almost like seen as a positive thing especially among progressive people\nSo but he but here's my ears would point the isn't um isn't anorexia form a of of physical this more for you but you see your body as fast even though you're sixty pounds isn't that just for you\nRight true the thing that gender thus far it is it does have biological correlate so this is a thing I find very confusing about the whole transgender movement is that you know some people argue that biology has nothing to do with that other people will argue that it is strongly biological I Would think that proponents of this movement would want to\nBe in alignment with the science that does show that his biological because that's not as some sort of\nSolidity I guess what they're saying because\nIt has to do with hormonal exposure in utero so I'm an example I can give as say girls who are exposed to higher level of testosterone into ... so higher levels of exposure to testosterone is associated with more male typical and trust and behaviors some girls who were exposed to higher levels of testosterone when they're born\nThere more male typical in their behavior they're all the more likely to\nWant to have the male gender identity\nSo it speaks to the biological influence even though people want to say that genders completely Douglas their first from that\nSo I I guess one of the things as I was reading the story a doctor so is is that there is a almost like we're talking about two different things you know what we were if what gender is ... ... of feeling\nThat is an interesting thing for people like you to to research on it and even even if it's a biological feeling that well you ... ...\nUm but it's not necessarily of interest on a on a form you know where you're turning into the government right I mean like that but\nIt's a it's a different I mean it may be in certain circumstances but why the government is asking for this information is not necessarily about someone's feelings or it's about it's about a a physical characteristic that they hold\nSo I mean is it just it is it just basically the gender does it mean what it used to I mean they are they using gender to say this is a feeling\nAnd therefore we should almost come up with a different word for what because what I'm describing and what we've talked about this entire time has nothing to do with feeling it's male or female about yeah it's about physical characteristics what does the word for that\nAs to what you mean I think from the perspective of what the administration is trying to do I think they shouldn't be allowed to collect\nThat information and that information and those data\nWithout it being such a controversial issue um and you know with regards to\nProtecting title nine and and women's rights I I don't know why people don't see it from that perspective that this is a positive thing because shouldn't that is seen as helping women right um and it kinda does boil down to this larger argument that's going on right now about\nPeople who are born female\nVersus the rights of transgender women and our transgender women\nWomen full stop and so there is the argument going on I don't know if either if you've been following this but with um\nIt's been mostly radical feminist I wouldn't consider myself a radical feminist but you know this group of very progressive women who are saying transgender women are not as saying that people who are born female so in this argument transgender activists have been winning so far and we see that in terms of how this\nNarrative has played out with the recent decision but in terms of what you're saying I I\nI I see what you're saying that I guess I'm using\nDifferent words to kind of in the same thing in that yes for people who are male or female\nThat gender is basically sex it is at the end the day the same thing but nowadays gender is being used in a different way to kind of argue for more progressive idea that you can do whatever you want\nTo and I'm not a thing where the best thing for a ... that's ... ... I'm not completely insane in in the belief that gender used to me I Can't wait for it like this is what I mean that would be making this word and making it to mean feelings instead of what it used to mean which was biological gender and treats\nRight and that that's why I think the ...\nSpread through this larger idea that genders spectrum because if you feel a certain way on one day and you feel differently on another day that must mean that your gender and must be something unrelated to a sect which is incredible\nSo more and more follow up on this is just as the New York times says identity comes from the gender identity comes from the brain not the body that originates between your ears than not between her legs if that is accurate and then as the defense of the transgender argument right it's not it's not a criticism of it it's just it's a defense of it\nIf that is true and it's in your brain and not between your legs why or their physical surgeries associated with being transgendered\nRight I mean that argument doesn't really make much sense and I I don't like the argument because it's not really accurate either because what's between your legs and what goes on your brain is linked show you can't really separate the two and treat them like they're completely different phenomena\nUm but there I mean there's a lot of the of aspects of this argument that that don't make sense I mean transgender actress will also say that gender is a social construct but\nIf that's the case why do you then made hormonal intervention to transition or just feel more in a line that was the the fact that you identify as so I guess my biggest gripes on this whole thing is that you know sex is\nAbout being male or female gender it's how you feel in relation to your sex but again as I said for the vast majority of us are biological logical sex does dictate our gender so I don't think the three of us are necessarily that you know give things that differently even though I'm using different terms to describe it\nAs he really the difficulty and politically incorrect question um if if if\nThis more for your for instance is we we say that it's bad to be anorexic because you were seeing your body and the way that is not reality and it's a dangerous it doesn't it's not a healthy\nThe outlook um we see the stats of people who have gender just this more for you and the suicide rates are really bad having\nThe sex change and everything else is not changing those suicide rates so why are we taking the the gender is more for you and say hey it's totally fine when it's not it's not the suicide rates were bad\nUh I Would agree but when we were taught that it's called ...

three or four hours yesterday with Sean Spicer\nIt's a fascinating guy\nFascinating guy yeah certainly has an amazing life experience or a couple of years yeah he's a guy who has a perspective not necessarily just another opinion everybody's got opinions everybody has to arm pits too and I don't necessarily want to smell yours um uh it's perspective really that matters a and\nHe has a really interesting perspective from what he what he has gone through\nA and um I did a pod cast with what's come out a couple of weeks and then we we had him on the news and why it matters um and yeah he was actually very positive\nUh about this this upcoming election for the Republicans if people turn out to vote he was in the you know\nThere's an interesting thing that's been going on and we've seen some positive trends for Republicans ...\nThere's a theory out there which is a is a competing theory or as to what's going to happen with the election we're about two weeks away people are voting right now I think up to seven million people nationwide ever voted at a as of yesterday\nI Believe is the number so voting I mean this is election day you're in the middle of it right now\nUh this is now we don't have a two week long election base that's just the way the world is um and it's interesting the idea that's being floated by people who want to give the Democrats shot at the Senate a better shot at the house\nIs there ... there was evidence of a cabin up bumped\nHowever that's not going to carry you to the election and we saw real improvement for the you know in the Senate for Republicans after Kavanaugh which of course is the exact opposite of what the right like I mean the Democrats did this to hurt Republicans actually seem to help them and that I think is pretty well established in the polling so far\nThe idea is and and there's some basis for that\nI thing happening is you get the bump from Kavanaugh but it's ... it's too far away from the election and doesn't help you a good example of of this exact phenomenon playing itself out if this is true would be the Access Hollywood tape\nAccess Hollywood tape came out in early October ... um Trump's polls plummeted and kill Hillary's went up that she opened up a very large lead and that lead\nTrickled down down down down down until the ... the very end they went from about eight or nine points right after that tape all the way down to about two two and a half points which is where the national polls ended up with Clinton up about two two and a half points about um so\nThe idea here is Kavanaugh gives them this nice bump and then it said before the election and the Democrats are able at the last second to cross the finish line ahead there you know some of the polling is is somewhat interesting on this if you look at a recent polling um they came out with the most recent poll from\nUm the cruise O'Rourke a race now ... there's been a couple of polls taken over the past week or so that have put Cruz only got four or five\nOr there was holding their was seven and nine and ten and twelve point leads for cruise the past few polls have been more like four and five point leads for starting to turn the other way which is the last thing you want it's tightening\nRadio and that was one of the arguments are Sean Spicer was making ashtrays really got to watch the trends which where these things are going now I think there was evidence you know there is evidence I think that uh you know the pictures mix we don't know this is one race there was some polling though that showed in Florida as well a pretty decent pulling for Democrats in the Senate that\nCame out yesterday with no set up by for ... uh there was a you know but I'm the same plane though I mean Menendez of New Jersey\nNow again once again looks vulnerable after it seemed like he had reopen up a lead and maybe he would cruise to the finish line he's now only up by three and a poll that just came out\nAnd you know you never id you could fool yourself as a Republican thinking gonna win a lot of New Jersey racist but it does I'm Chris Christie was governor there for two terms of just casually happened\nA ... it's a terrible candidate who you know ... or white likely was paying underage prostitutes for sex that he was not able to convict over language ah ah well yeah you can judge whether you think that's a good or a bad thing but it seems like it occurred uh so I didn't polling pretty mixed right now there was another fall by the way I'm an ... you know um\nSome polls are showing that Cruz ... race even tighter so I don't know I mean\nIt it was interesting to hear Sean Spicer talked about it because Spicer as you would know is that you know was the original spokesperson for Donald Trump\nOr and became famous for that but has a very long ... long military career and he was a he was a very much a a you know a Washington insider really knew the behind the scenes politics of it and you hear him
