to the group several weeks ago six\nThree ten pet or why why [noise]\nKeep in mind one of them is our answer forward [noise]\nLet me start by telling you about the seven\nI Am and the high school teacher a mother of three boys three one boy I Am a higher little stricter\nI was a police officer in Arlington policeman Virginia for thirty seven years\nI wanted their politics to be very very different\nI Would be probably considered a constitutional conservative\nI find to be all that that I get the more progressive and liberal but I become and very much on on both sides I oh is that for the person that scares me though and\nI even wanted their experiences and feelings about guns to be different\nBy herself yeah shot down in the closet tens or not yeah shot that I'm I'm a retired navy combat pilots\nHave guns in our homes that are locked out I had never seen them I don't want to say that ... started shooting I just asked my dad and his redneck buddies out in the country\nWe're thoughtful well informed good hearted people who all agreed to spend an entire evening talking to people they didn't even know why to come up with a list I wanted to find a list even if it was a very short one specific practical things that we could all agree upon to\nHelp combat this intangible threat to our kids that we all think from time to time an intangible threat that a leash a teacher in the room gleaned from the perspective of being inside the schools each and every day\nAnd any time there is any sort of anything out of the norm at school they can get weird they get upset and just feeling among the entire school\nThan something tried fully wrong and I think it all over the country I think that you hear and noise in the hallway when you're ISIS quiet and everyone had turn\nWith that awareness we begin talking\nThis story on that conversation has two parts the content that dumped up with that and then the impact what happened because of what was said so content as\nWe search for the list for almost four hours I'd like to share with you the three biggest impediments we came up against because in this new era of communicating and communication I think there was considering remember same children same goal\nImpediment number one opinions outnumber people I Do realize\nThat in this age unlimited access to opinion that although there were seven people physically sitting around me there were many more opinions and voices brought into our conversation listened to the polling exchange between two mothers Anna a progressive and Mona a Christian conservative\nAnd see how many people's opinions and perspectives that brought into the mix other than their own\nFrom my side what I hear in\nOh I don't infringe on any of my right and I don't want any restriction on myself

that's not representative and and so how do we solve that problem with getting the papal from stopping the ones that are out there trying to send a message because\nFor me I think it's the wrong way

the opposition are the people leading this leadership that the Democrat Party or or we'll have this right in Nineteen eighty four with the inter Korean out a party and what I see happening with my friends on the on the left as they're out a party members they\nWork every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media and they're being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a ... for the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts on that\nUh I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference in unusual and virtually or people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the right punching back the people on the\nLeft and both sides suck\nWhile they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seeing their side being unreasonable violence if you see anti FAA the way to answer ... is not\nWith uh the militant people it will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets\nThat is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment\nThat Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and you don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly\nAs we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer um are a Judeo Christian country\nWith those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group you have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways\nTo be peaceful and not part of that angry crowd it's what I've talked about for Twenty years there's going to come a point where everybody's going to be running in a certain direction

I agree with every book I think it's awesome and I want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess okay you're you're um\nYou're talking about how am I going to come in and you know replace almost all the jobs and and I know you don't necessarily agree with the I bet you've said that we need to at least have a conversation about\n... of it yeah and I you\nKnow I think we need to be careful about even\nI'm considering the I I think that there really is ... fear over a I to try to come in and ... that's ... yeah it's I think that they want to push that starts socialism\nI think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other\nTechnical right on ... where ... you know the ... they were afraid that tight and I'll do it's going to come and direct place their thoughts download their problem correct and so\nUm I understand that hey I definitely I mean and it's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people that want to create a\nMachine thing if they are running you know there are certain things I just can't they don't like I'm being\nA ... a leak in her climbing in her house probably not going to do that\nUm as far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think many people are going to be upset if they got into ... and not have to deal with anyone that chick fillet isn't known for their service and I ... that\nLet me ask you this let me ask you this first of all just a ... there's ... it don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this um ... or ... what books are you reading on AI what what are you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general it cannot than they work unless I'm so I'm coming this for you know different perspectives are having a pretty search that I Know that you have sure on that but\nYou know just my feeling like a a I was going to absolutely they will to diagnose cancer um quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nSo have there are there is a there and I can't remember the name of it on the ... on this particular subject but I Will look for it or there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a that that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see our emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but a while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while\nI'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment that no one has to work that everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are\nGoing to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created that is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do\nThat true a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to go through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died they'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message\nMuch better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about\nThree four years ago the uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board and what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that is seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it it's I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please so you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen\nBefore and we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty\nAnd the world will not be like it is today you started your comment about the section of the book where I uh there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income I Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nBut we as
