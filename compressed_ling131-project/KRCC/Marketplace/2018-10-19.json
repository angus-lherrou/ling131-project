Hi I'm Jennifer ... for\nFor the complicated couple years for Facebook in this economy also for mainstream media both are being criticized by politicians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook needed that content to users than a court filing this week should some new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot\nTo video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair walking to the program thanks for having me back a couple of years ago April two thousand sixteen ... says we are pivoting the video at Facebook and journalism to does what\nJournalists and pundits that basically and\nThey say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this law suits but maybe it didn't work out so well\nRight so I I mean I think for publishers that's was kind of a second costs policy they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook adding to face but kind of eating into that traffic so when Facebook says representing video\nIt's kind of like a thing where Facebook says jumping publishers say okay now I Know and so they invest all these resources into doing video\nAnd then in twenty six you know twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate writers and higher video producer is how this happened to places like ah MTV knew that happened to block it as Mike dot com\nRight or even higher video producer is so this happened to places like at MTV News and having to block it as Mike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nOr so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but a ... the reason is germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook should wait ... video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this last week not only were they lost imprisoned then thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that Facebook inflated the number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were seeing with as many of you accounts [noise]\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken fish books a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nSure I mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go around here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe arguing their own homework and aren't keeping tabs on the number is as close as they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream\nAnd ah yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though one has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the newsroom people were laid off organizations were changed and or I'm Sorry to use this word pivoted um\nBecause of what Facebook should do\nYeah I mean again it was kind of a case where obviously media dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing Facebook is doing and they think that this could be at\nAnd and they kind of just jumped into both the what is Facebook tend to say first of all I Know a lot it is obviously refuting the fried claims and the lawsuit right now it did um I mean obviously it took them accountability and twenty sixteen when these discrepancies kind of first ah emerge publicly\nBut I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that that it didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matters to opening in coordination and everybody's going to have to absolutely Microsoft is separate or a bus I think you [noise]\n\n\nJust followed on the way out today and which I Am sorry to be the one that has to tell you but you don't stand a chance I mean yes somebody who's going to win\nBut the odds are
