into law Sunday requiring that publicly held corporations headquartered in this state include women on their boards\nThis law as the first of its kind in the U.S and we've got Jenna McGregor to talk about it she covers corporate governance for the Washington Post thanks for being there\nThanks for having me run down and what this law is and who will be affected by it\nSo California Governor Jerry Brown just signed into law a bill that lawmakers there have been trying to get through for a long time to actually require companies that have their principal offices in California can have\nWhat we'll start with at least one female director on their board\nDid do most forward to include women already I mean how how unusual is it either to have women on board to not have women ...\nParticularly large companies most have a woman on the board large publicly traded companies but\nUh their numbers show that about twenty five percent of companies headquartered publicly traded headquartered\nCompanies in California do not have any women and they're trying to fix that issue through having a mandate it starts it will grow over time over the next couple of years they're going to add to it where it's not just one that you were acquired habit depending on the ... the board they want you to have\nOne two or three and really most companies are probably going to need to have three that are headquartered in California\nWhat happens if your company is headquartered in California but say your incorporated somewhere else does this still apply\nFor the question here said they have put through this bill but there are both business in California some corporate governance experts including a for a number of the FCC has said\nState of sorts it will grow over time over the next couple of years they're going to add to it where it's not just one that you were required to have but depending on the side support they want you to have one two or three and really most companies are probably going to need to have three that are headquartered in California\nWhat happens if you're a company is headquartered in California but say your incorporated somewhere else does this still apply\nAbout the big question here said they have put through this bill but they're both business in California some corporate governance experts including a former members of the FCC has said you know what\nThis may not fly this may face some legal challenges because many many many companies are actually incorporated in Delaware which the state that I have\nA little friendlier business environment and that you know so law has said those are the legal circumstances under which a company has to follow and show it may not apply to the this this law may face some legal challenges from companies who say they shouldn't matter\nWhen governor Jerry Brown was talking about this he referred to recent events in Washington and and you wrote about the ah Brett Kavanaugh hearings in the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd sort of the appearance of having a female prosecutor there in the room um how much of this is about the parents and how much is about change in corporate governance\nWell I have seen the same question of whether he is trying to make a statement particularly this week although this was the deadline to end up September for deciding to sign it into law so what was this a way of making a statement of of what the country has been and engage in a major national conversation about yeah I'm the\nIssue of whether having more women on the board has any impact is is a good question there is a lot of research that shows it does have a good impact but it leads to either higher returns or better decision making or better price mergers yet\nThe question is how do you do it do you actually require them to do it do you have incentives for them to do it do you do it through kind of public shaming [laughter] and so what what is the best approach to getting more diversity on the board or getting more diversity in a room full of any decision makers\nJenna McGregor from the Washington Post thank you so much\nThanks for having me [noise]\nRogers yet\nThe

October seconds good to have you with us\nBefore we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last month and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders he called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop Bezos act as an Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos\nThe deal with tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing to encourage those employers to pay higher wages\nAt is reportedly true in some states of Amazon while the company announced that as of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this\nShe's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage and\nShe's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program thanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour ... kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nSo Amazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour or so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by this\nThey specifically mentioned part time and temporary workers ah they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid positions than a full time positions\nAnd they should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers in general in the whole United States was about uh about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely oh a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers\nAmazon and its announcement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour\nBut even without the federal wage increasing this likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Wal Mart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour that's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the the movement in that direction\nReally I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier um so that's kind of wanting to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market as Walmart is by the same token a lot of other firms are already\nAnnouncing these types of bigger wage increases so for example targeted aside at want it to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact do you think this will have on communities where suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly there are places where this raise we'll have\nBuying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economies it also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are\nBe a good thing for those local economies\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses on their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local markets\nA would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement\nWe're going to look at how far are Fifteen dollars an hour really goes for an average worker but what kind of impact do you think this could have on the larger economy\nAmazon has what two hundred fifty thousand employees plus another hundred thousand seasonal workers as you've said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen\nBut if you were of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend I mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend when\nPay expands for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy that's good in general for growth um we also going to want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation if\nWages go up generally that's great but we have been experiencing some optics and inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail Wozniak teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much things to any as the professor and I were discussing\nAmazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit meanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage so what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour marketplaces Renata Sago talked to some of the people who would know

workers in cities like New York Los Angeles and Seattle have seen their wages go up to Fifteen dollars in recent years the piper Fifteen as it's known continues and now Amazon employees across the

or as it's officially now in the U.S Mexico Canada agreements reached over the weekend\nIs already raising some complaints from North of the border Canadians are worried their drug prices will go

trade representative pharmaceutical makers and others\nAnd when we looked at the north Carolina data after Hurricane Florence we found that in that state alone federal state and local governments have spent more than eight hundred and twenty eight million dollars cumulatively for those beaches\nWow and what is the argument for spending that money\nSo the local residents would argue that they need that money to keep their tourism economy going to keep their properties up\nAnd that you know people from all over the country come and enjoy these beaches so the government should help fund their economies\nThe people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties so these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansions right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects\nWhy is that who decides which beaches to protect in which to leave alone that\nThis is sort of decided on a case by case basis some communities actually find most of this work themselves through local and county taxes and so in that case the federal government isn't really involved\nBut for many communities it's the Army Corps that decides which communities get funded and the way the Army Corps makes these decisions they use that economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities\nAnd the reason that is is that the corps tries to see which projects can they fund where they'll get the most out of every dollar spent so in essence that ends up savoring more affluent communities\nAnd not just affluent but predominantly white right\nYes um so the analysis we did in North Carolina we looked at about sixteen communities that have received funding for these projects and the average uh demographics in those communities but something like Ninety four percent white\nAnd you found that the effect is that they're the same beaches just keep getting rebuilt over and over again can you talk about an example [noise] tell me about rights bill beach\nSure right seal beach has been rebuilt I think more than twenty times\nPeople tell me about rates ville beach sure
