I Would have bought ... because even though we paid an extra price that we\nDidn't think we should have paid it put us into all so many places I've forgotten number of how many branches we got but in those days you got the one down the street from my house where I bank I mean right and which country you're in California that we've gone from seven or branches to a thousand I think it was a fabulous platform for Jake more to grow so I still would have done that one\nAre you satisfied that um we have the protections in place now\nTo avoid something like that happening again\nYou know you should never be satisfied and I are more explained that ... the regular should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap I gave you just do leeman redux\nIt wouldn't happen they would have had not twenty below the capital but fifty\nBut because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot more liquidity a lot more transparency if it did go bankrupt at the moment of bankruptcy it would have created another hundred billion dollars of equity than most over cap wise for him in the world\nThe government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind yeah but ... it was a disorderly unwind assets were thrown people couldn't get their cash markets we're going to collapse because they had to sell assets that was ...\nSo the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger but with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess what the future as I say what is the worst could possibly be and can we handle it and to me family means I can still serve my client does not mean to have to run in panic\nBut you always be quite as their question where's the next problem coming from it will be different from the last problem cyberattacks on other institutions clearing houses and I'm not worried about shadow banking but they're always going to be issued a shadow banking severe regulator you should be really cautious about what's happening in a way from banks\nAre you worried about you know given all that cyber and all of that are you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about a politicians and them stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we plant\nFed and its actions are and are you worried about a politicians and them stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we plan for both not being exactly the way you expect it so I think the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road something happens it's too much inflation the feds move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my and my company could easily handle it\nBut it is possible just likes them just like the terrorists can cause problems that you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause a problem just like Joyce it can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking to figure out and make sure you can handle bad outcomes\nJumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get the terrorists in a second but the funny back you up for a minute\nOn the healthy economy and I'm not going to argue that the headline facts right jobs GDP all of that good stuff but as you said are on the forty whatever it is Florida this building looking out ... literally it at the American economy there's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up and I mean there are some not small problems yeah\nSo the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen you have to wait I'm not I I Want to it but the good in the back yard so the good as we have wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico\nAre we've got all the all of the food and water and energy we need\nWe have or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise the best universities that why is the capital markets and yes income inequality the real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to hurt the economy has been going in Munich early and it's ... it and it was driving low wage growth bless small business formation\nAnd all these other things that we need to fix okay but load and the architects of the American public to everything we talk about their or fixes for be put her mind to it\nAnd kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it all\nI appreciate the positivity generally I Do if there was some reality are right we have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back from the international arena the president said in the at the un across town a couple of days ago it is America First right so\nDo you reconcile that with what you call for in your letter which is intelligent thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy\nWhere virtually have slipping a bit so that we have not had more of a cat or Mexico's Eighteen forty eight\nMexico's extreme quite well and we should treat them very respectfully but you're absolutely correct this trade issue a medical a skirmish yeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade\nActually but you're actually practice trade issue a medical a skirmish yeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade what so what do you see that it's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish 'cause it sure doesn't look like anybody back into\nThat look we advise the president that while you're young while you were you\nYeah we have and I know lots of us have done it and I'm most was said that we understand that you should uh China and he's right\nNon tariff barriers tariff barriers will property all intellectual property\nIs owned enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day that President succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey you know your method worked I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems\nSo she'll put on your your most objective Jamie diamonds self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you\nI don't think so I mean there are enjoying a lot of leverage zero or twenty eight million companies in America\nI mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy and a lot of other big banks so I'm I I'm going to be could be one of the Chinese banks folks I I don't say that lightly\nThey they are already they have a bigger home market they make more money to were worth more than a market value there's so many Chinese banks make more money than we do\nThey have aspirations and they showed their going overseas and they showed their find their Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also proud to compete one day with alley pay and we chat ten cent and\nSo I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're gonna have competitors I Want J. P. Morgan Chase me the best bank in the world I wanted to be an American bank\nAnd it would I think would be a mistake for America the best things in the world and the biggest things in the world were Chinese banks well so here's actually a good phone question do we as an economy\nOr get the benefit of your size that makes it worth the risk of you being so big\nYes because remember scale economy is that is true for banks is true for auto companies are true for law industries the beneficiary of skill of economics is to clients\nThat it's not the company\nBecause capitalism forces to return to the company lower uh and and also our size and diversity it's why we had no issues to distort [noise]\nThere was a whole lot more to that interview of course Jamie diamond on the next crisis for one thing we've got the transcript online it's on our corner office pod cast as well also at marketplace out or whether a cyber attack could actually cause the next financial crisis [noise]\n\nIt plays out or whether a cyberattack could actually cause the next financial crisis [noise]\n\nThis one alone on the way out today in which I rise on behalf of all New Yorkers grew up there by the way to protest the bomb a nation that apple is calling a bagel and a new set of ... that it's coming out with the next Iowa's update whatever that\nWonder bread looking smooth cross dude frozen food section clearly never touched by human hands too too perfect round thing with a hole in it is\nIt is not a big old notes are also and this just in from the marketplace desk of shameless self promotion Molly Wood and I are doing a reading AMA tomorrow she the host marketplace checked me those cheer us together on a podcast called making smart\nAnyway ask us anything I guess we gotta say tomorrow to be on the eastern eliminating Pacific on the I Am a sub read it\nAsked me about the new big limo gee maybe how about that [noise]\nMarketplace it supported progressive insurance comparing car insurance rates from multiple insurers so shoppers can evaluate options in one place now that's progressive comparisons available for granted dot com are one eight hundred progressive ten ...
