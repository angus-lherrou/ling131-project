to have you with us\nAnd we start today with NAFTA or rather the deal to replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nAnd this we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars a new purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\nHi Lindsay Manufacturing powerhouse that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it's it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs there at the center of the rhetoric trickle of everything and the ... and ... were a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple let's say you assemble cars and trucks to sell\nHere in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW right now sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico where the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever yup boost that up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanction ready or else that you have to do these chores or else I take away your phone like we say that in my house or the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you make cars and Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession you might say well you know instead of ...\nHas to be from Mexico or the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal and after two point oh whatever you have to set up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanction ready or else that you have to do these chores or else I'd take away your phone right we see that in my house or the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you make cars and Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession\nYou might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain in finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and his bureaucratic\nI'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent and since I'm non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China and more jobs in Mexico\nOr let's say OK I follow the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars and sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus here has been high wage jobs and they're probably Asian and is to create and protect auto jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour ... fit into that\nSo there's still says a large percentage of each vehicle has to be made my workers who make sixteen bucks an hour or more\nSo what uh companies do and we just got pushed up will sometimes yes they hire more workers who make more money\nSometimes they say you know what it's time for me to invest in Warsaw scored and more robots more automation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might\nWell so looking a little more broadly you don't take 'em all of the terrorists against Canada and Mexico you know not all off the table and it's a little confusing let's hear and what's not\nYet so right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place in the justification is because of national security soaked Canadian steel Mexican steel still subject to that and it's more complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles\nComing as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration and that that's on a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America [noise]\nIt's interesting here in D.C today what are the chances that song get approved by Congress well good\nLuckily the predicting now a vote on this would come next year\nYeah so right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those who are in place and the justification is

chances this all gets approved by Congress well\nGood luck with your predicting a vote on this time next year after the midterms when there's a good chance the Democrats could we will take the house rights and historically Democrats have been more anti trade deal now this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMarketplaces ... thank you very much You're welcome\nNAFTA has had a long history questioned for yet who was the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to market place dot ORG and click on a little tab that ... mentioned on air\nNow we're going to stay with trade and the U.S M.
