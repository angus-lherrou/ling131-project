services ... the [noise]\nIn Los Angeles I'm Guy Raz all it is Monday the day the twenty second of October is always to have you along everybody\nYou know of all the topics that economic Washington deals with at a policy level few of them bring with them more wailing and gnashing of teeth then these two seemingly simple words currency\nManipulation the subject comes up every six months of department the Treasury Department whether it's quite a put out a report listing those economies that are manipulating their currencies to gain competitive advantage and really here though we are talking about one economy right China that as we told you last week the Treasury Department did not repeat not\nSay Beijing is manipulating its currency but that did not end the wailing and the national over the weekend treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he might actually consider changing the rules the department uses to decide whether countries are playing fast and loose with the foreign exchange markets so we asked marketplaces Tracey Samuelson why all the for X held up\nNot super high in the last\nThis is not something that very many countries have done historically and not something many countries are doing today\nDavid Steinberg is a professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins [noise] but if you worry as the president does that other countries some more to us than we do to them then you worry about the ways that exchange rates can make those foreign goods even more appealing Matthew Goodman is with the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThere's a close relationship between currency and trade policies\nThing is Goodman says China isn't currently evaluating its currency for competitive advantage\nThey don't you know clearly meet the test of manipulation at the moment\nAnd anyway the label just doesn't pack that much punch feels legal at the University of Maryland\nIs kind of a strange tool because if we deemed China to be a currency manipulator the result of that is and we have to have talks with China about it but of course we're talking with them already\nThen there's the politics Derek scissors with the American Enterprise Institute\nRemember the president said he would call China currents him and I put on day one we've now gone through four rounds of reports where they haven't called them corruption manipulator and you know their reasons for that but that's not what he campaigned on\nWhich could put him on the defensive on the next campaign trail I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nA detour now to personal finance and all that and that all important credit score the way to heavily on people's economic wellbeing psycho would you short for fair Isaac corporation and gives you didn't know it Richard credit history and gives you said score\nBut nobody said this morning it's coming up with a new number the new product if you will of the gold ultra psycho for people who don't have much of a credit history to begin with\nOr who maybe didn't have the greatest credit in the past marketplaces ... short has more now on who stands to gain from that\nIf you don't have a credit history it's kind of hard to get a credit score like it's hard to get a grade class if you've never taken any of the test so what if I go is doing instead with ultra psycho is looking at other information besides your credit history to figure out how credit worthy you are\nThat includes not having a history of negative balances having stating and trends acting responsibly\nSally Taylor is scores vice president at by go she says you have to volunteer this information willingly it's not automatic there are fifty three million people in the U.S who don't have a credit score students are immigrants for example\nIt's cooler will tap into another ten to Fifteen million we estimate that fifty three million that's of course the million\nStudents are immigrants for example\nIt's cooler will tap into another ten to Fifteen now and we estimate that fifty three now\nThat's of course millions more people for lenders to lend to and for if I go to score Taylor also says this will raise the credit scores for some people jak Gillis is executive director of the consumer federation of America\nThe folks that will benefit the most from this are those folks who have marginal credit scores or who don't really have much credit\nBetter scores can save people money they affect your insurance your car loan your mortgage now the question for any new type of credit squared though is is it accurate Jonathan glow he is a principal a consulting firm ...\nSo it's very easy to create credit scores when the economy is going well in ... are very low where the robbers going to hit the road is really when we hit the next rough patch\nThe next recession is when you find out which loans should not have been made in New York I'm Sabrina short for marketplace ain't that always the way on Wall street today ... name is volatility will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\nThere are in case you somehow haven't been keeping track Fifteen days until the mid term elections\nAnd while acknowledging that past performance is no guarantee of future results if the next two weeks or anything like the past couple of months who boys a lot of political money going to be spent the center for Responsive Politics figures five billion dollars from all sources is going to wind up being spent on the two thousand Eighteen congressional elections a lot of it coming from\nWell shall we say the upper end of the income distribution marketplaces Justin who has that one\nOne of the reasons there's so much money flowing into these midterm elections is because billionaires alleging more of their cash and politicians\nThis is something that sort of arose out of in North as fortunate as being made\nOr the last few decades\nThat stand for political scientist Adam Monica he found that the total wealth the forks four hundred jumped eleven to fold since Nineteen eighty two and the amount will be people spend on politics has gone up in proportion historically he says\nPretty clear that there was a lot more money coming from very wealthy conservative\nLike casino mogul Sheldon Adelson he's or thirty four billion dollars and he's a staunch supporter of Republican\nThat there was a lot more money coming from very wealthy conservative\nLike casino mogul Sheldon Adelson he's or thirty four billion dollars and he's a staunch supporter of Republicans and pro Israel issues after giving Donald Trump twenty five million for his election he doesn't watch from the front row as the president celebrated the opening of an embassy in Jerusalem\nBusier Adelson and his wife if pony up eighty seven million dollars to conservative groups and candidates but lately ... says many billionaires are leaning another way\nAnd over time it's been trending pretty clearly towards more money going to the darkest\nConservative candidates have earned more billionaire donations the data from the center for Responsive Politics show Democrats are catching up\nBut like I said that's because a lot of newer billionaires come from more liberal places like Silicon Valley Dustin Moskowitz the billionaire cofounder of Facebook gave over five million to groups like move on dot org can a group dedicated to winning Senate races others say the polarized political climate over the last two years his let more people in general to contribute\nI feel this is an emotional need for people to engage\nThat's ... next year in America that's the political action committee run by one of the biggest democratic donors Tom's dire hedge fund billionaire from San Francisco you might know style from his controversial ad campaign to impeach the president which hasn't been uniformly popular with Democrats\nA Republican Congress ones impeach depresses reform in\nDire as political groups are spending a hundred and ten million dollars I'm liberal causes an east coast billionaires are spending a lot to Boston based hedge fund manager sets Carmen recently announced he'd donate twenty million to help elect Democrats after years of supporting the GOP\nFormer New York city Mayor Michael Bloomberg pledged a hundred million to help elect Democrats that could prove useful is Bloomberg eyes a democratic presidential bid and twenty twenty\nContributions Bloomberg's a pretty easy to track but then there's what's known as dark money\nThat we're seeing the spending side that we don't necessarily know who is actually behind it and a lot of the cases\n... researchers dark money at the center for Responsive Politics a huge chunk of the spending goes to advertising and depending on what the ad say she says their funders don't always have to be disclosed\nThat makes it hard to tell whether it's a billionaire spending or a corporation or anyone else\nSo through the through the other half of the question then\nSo to the to the other half of the question then why did the Federal Communications commission let Sinclair do this so many times\nThere is no simple answer to that I mean the the FCC comes under a lot of criticism for allowing too much consolidation has been a problem under both Democratic and Republican administrations\nUm they have allowed a number of enormous monopolies to form now I should say that I'm In the late nineties the FCC did investigate Sinclair for this sort of fraudulent divested her strategy\nThey ended up finding that Sinclair had violated some of these rules and they were not making good faith truly independent divested jurors and um they find the company brace herself forty thousand dollars which is really not a lot of money to a large corporation like Sinclair\nA word here in defense of the Federal Communications commission or Sinclair has one it's about Tribune Media for a while they had a deal and just recent well a number of months ago but recently in relative terms uh Germany have sushi pie shut innocence I'm not going to let that happen the Tribune\nMerger would sort of a fascinating little window into the business in regulatory environment that had sprung up under President Trump there was this real sense that the merger would just get waved through because Trump is a big supporter of Mr Smith end up Sinclair and he was tweeting positive statements about the company\nAnd several weeks ago I G pie announced while we're not going to approve this deal we have major concerns in effectively killed the deal referred it to a legal hearing within the FCC which sort of doing that\nBut what we've learned since then it's Sinclair was basically behaving in such a way that it was a foregone conclusion they did not even make minimal effort to appease their regulators and get their deal approved\nAnd they had had such success for such a long period of time for the odds were in their favor\nThe trick had worked in the past and the number of regulatory experts I spoke with said well it's sort of one thing to try and pull off that trick with the champagne messenger is when you're a much smaller company but once you are the largest company in the country and you are about to become even larger the government's going to take a closer look\nAnd even in this incredibly friendly environment what they were trying to do with so brazen that the FCC had to put a stop to it\n... a staff writer for the New Yorker running most recently about Sinclair broadcasting company also here early on and on the front of what to do is I\nAre you here every now and then a lot of fun it with a Jewish actually thank you [noise]\nOn the theory that knowing industry no matter how new or how potentially big issue is is immune\nFrom disruption cast a glance now toward recreational marijuana if you would it's legal in nine states including here in California home to what is widely expected to be the biggest legal recreational pot industry in the country and\nAnd it's not unrelated also home to much of the technological innovation in this economy right now David Weinberg reports on super\nBut for pot it's after dark on a friday night\nA woman who goes by the name\n... is circling a luxury hotel in downtown Los Angeles [noise]\nShe's looking for a middle aged woman with long gray hair capri pants and a pink and white checkered top\nPoint I've been trying to do last January you standing\nShe stops in front of the hotel and ignored the bellhop who's trying to get her to pull forward\nThe woman she's looking for walks up to the car and Hans ... a hundred dollar bill\nGives your hands the woman or white paper bag full of marijuana and the woman tells her to keep the change marijuana is still illegal at the federal level so transactions like this are usually cash only and these days no big deal\nI can see it's paying on law\nAnd a lot of people around knowing really bats an eyelash just another day in\nSunny California\nNow a month later ... whose real name is Mary and co ten is out of a job the dispensary she worked for the downtime patient group suddenly stopped its delivery service\nThey would not comment for this story but the margins for pot delivery are tight drivers are not gig workers but they are for lifting the rubber state law requires them to W. to employees making at least minimum wage and getting benefits and digital disruption is also changing the industry one of the state's biggest players in the delivery space\nA Silicon Valley startup called ET's where it eases uh Los Angeles headquarters in Venice Beach David Mak is a senior vice president of public affairs for ... the company raised more than fifty million dollars from investors which helps pay for this office space and luxurious home\nPresident of public affairs for ... the company raised more than fifty million dollars from investors which helps pay for this office space in the luxurious home once owned by Angelica Houston\nHe points out employees sitting behind a wall of giant computer monitors\nSo the orders come through the ease platform the orders are then routed to a local license suspense re partner\nOnce that business receives an order ... software dispatches a driver who was an employee of the dispensary not ease\nLast count I asked earlier today there are approximately twelve hundred drivers with dispensaries that are on these platform\nOne thing you'll never see at ease as marijuana the company does not have a state pot license and never touches the product to stay clear of federal law enforcement max at ease makes money by charging dispensaries defeat and taking a percentage of every sale for dispensaries that don't have a lot of foot traffic delivery can be crucial\nBut dispensary owner Jared ... isn't sold he met with ease and was alarmed by the business agreement they offered\nSo it kind of look like we're going to take every part of your business and take no risk because they don't hold a license so it looked like a Trojan Horse\nCarlos says he only wanted to sell products it endorses and limited his access to a customer data but other dispensaries sees as an engine for gross\nYou know back in the early days it was you know really just we had two people in the morning to people in the evening\nSky Segal is a manager for perennial
