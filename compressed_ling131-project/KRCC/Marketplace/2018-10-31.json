clean but it is\nProbably going to have to get a little bit racy bringing welcome to the program\nHi Kay [noise] so this is going to sound like a weird way to start this interview but I'm the ... the entire premise of this article and and the job of intimacy coordinators is that for actors this shit is a workplace it's the office\nYeah and I mean I think that you know it hasn't been treated like that in the past I don't think that it was necessarily\nOut of nine ten or on purpose by people get really uncomfortable effects especially in a workplace but it's something that really needs to be spoken about explicit we win sects and sexuality is involved in the actual job of making us found are making a TV show\nSo within the bounds of what the Federal Communications commission will let us

to\nGet readers to enter into a TV set and what it's like for an actor and what that can be on the day when they're filming a sex scene\nAnd the case of and we meet who plays Laurie on the juice she

you have to say that right but but how does she do how did she do that\nAlisha well off and get the script and she will go to the actor and she'll tell them what's in the script and then she will work it out with them defining what they feel comfortable with talking to them about their boundaries about anything that they would like on set to help them feel safe so then go back to the director on the producers and\nSee if she can work something out everyone feels good about then when it comes to the day of filming\nShe is often standing within I shot of Dr um she is usually looking at the monitor to see how the scene is playing a so she's there to comment on the\nChoreography and she will help them protect themselves she'll tell them how to make things look more real without them having to do something that feels more sexual to them so it's about choreography the same way that we have fight scene choreography\nWrote a HBO it kind of makes sense is is leading the way on this or
