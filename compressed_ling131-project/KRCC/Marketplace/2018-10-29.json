E. O. J. D. rom it is to figure out how to grow again\nThis is a pricey batch thirty four billion dollars for red hat is sixty three percent more than what the market the company was worth on friday I'm Scott Tong for marketplace\nAs I said speaking of markets Wall Street was lousy today not as lousy as it could have been though will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\nHere's a story about getting what you pay for or more accurately getting what you don't pay for you don't have to spend a lot of time driving around almost anywhere in this country\nTo know that our infrastructure our road specifically are in bad shape typically the money to maintain and sometimes even improve those roads comes from gas taxes California is one of several states that increase it gas tax not too long ago to get more money\nTo make more repairs but as often happens when your taxes not everybody's happy about him and I have taken to the ballot with the anti tax proposition six coming to California ... California voters a week from tomorrow was marketplaces Jed Kim reports now from the streets of LA changes in what kinds of cars are on the road\nCould make the gas tax difference\nHe line Lippmann has brought me to the corner of Venice and Figaro in downtown LA\nIt's next to the convention center staple center and I was highway\nHas brought me to the corner of Venice in Figaro in downtown LA\nIt's next to the convention center staple center\nAnd I was highway highway yeah the one where I can hear the noise coming through um Lipman\nIs with the transportation organization called who is LA [noise]\nHe's against proposition six because he says the sex is necessary\nPoints out the ... in the paper [noise]\nGot a big fire a couple of big titles here\nLipman says the state has a backlog of a hundred and thirty billion dollars in its instructor investments in roads and bridges\nRoads that are less safe bridges that are less safe\nAnd we ... heart investing in the states and the way that we need [noise]\nLast year California legislators decided to patch that hundred\nThirty billion dollar hole by raising the state's tax on gasoline from Eighteen cents a gallon to thirty cents\nAlmost immediately a group formed to put forward proposition six to overturn the increase and require all future hikes to be approved by voters rather than legislators\nCalled the ... is chairman of the yes on prop six campaign he blames the poor infrastructure situation on mismanagement\nThe politicians have more than enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money\nSo we don't need to add the cost of living burdens to working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it but even if the gas tax word stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands for one thing these Texas haven't been indexed to inflation\nAnother reason can be seen directly across that street\nIn downtown LA at Honda dealership\nIts windows advertise hybrids another fuel efficient cars\nKrista Ghouta is out on the law joking with other salesmen\nI ask him how many people come in looking for good mileage most of it that\nTax cuts them in nine countries coming for the first day looking putting a guest\nAnd they're finding it some vehicles top out at\nOver fifty miles to the gallon\nFor people maybe had to buy you know five gallons of gas to go a hundred miles now maybe they got by gallons of gas\n... researches transportation finance at San jose State University\nAnd as a result they're paying less in gas taxes and they were previously\nI'll take you in here to the war room because more than ... says take where the draft is how\nDo you know ... or one two three four ... four or five like minded soldiers in Spring Hill which are shows us ... of course I'm for this phone you can or the best guess as I said you regret\nThe way that the the building as designed is the the the basketball courts are at the center of the building and when you know when you hear the basketball that kind of like the heartbeat of the building and um so now we're walking as if ... you know we are one of the player week\nSo we'd rooms trading rooms right of course are over there the beautiful weight rooms and drove so this was a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the players right this is where the rubber meets the road um [noise] so what keeps you up at night but what's your worst [laughter]\nMy my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us\nAnd and be part of what we're building and we've missed the playoffs every year for five years so this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to in in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back its its elevated the brand now we just need to do that\nI don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask her view in la brown and ... and Magic Johnson the drug for basketball and and you know ... and the other best what grades have you guys have the conversation on yourself about look\nThis isn't going to be rebuilding\n[noise] um yeah you you know yes I mean magic has definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operations\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw\nI felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball was that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting because liquor basketball's like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we've had three coaches and three years\nYou know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which I'm working all the time you were in uncertainty and and not only does regular business suit on Saturday So too does the sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose sports team right on search he was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said Jeannie don't let the team\nFail like don't let go do run into the ground who say oh yeah who looked like\nIt it would break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I ask him how long is it going to take you to get the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized it wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite kitt [laughter] if\nI were to hear about your family right I mean Dr closer to your brother who work with and then and then had to replace\nYou talk a lot you talked about it in your book you talked about it in interviews about how this is a family business show those first couple of years when the commissioner we'd culture and says don't blow it with the family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nWas very very difficult um\nYou know my dad kind of set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nOf the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in your question about about and making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of years did you wait too long\nThat was the my first comment publicly was I apologized to Laker fans because ... perhaps I did wait too long\nUm as you can hear the music or early ... it's it's funny because we actually have a DJ now on staff I Know because yeah it's like these young players they they're used to multitasking there used to having music while they're doing whatever let me show you into and\nI Wonder if you're on your own ...
