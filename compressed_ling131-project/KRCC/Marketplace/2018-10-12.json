everybody take your pick for where you want to start in trying to figure out what went on this weak economy was the markets the president and the fed the international Monetary Fund oh forget that one\nSo much to wrap up so little time here to do it in the studio with me or maybe I'm In the studio with them 'cause I'm usually in LA and you guys are here legally Gallagher's Fortune Magazine ... is at MSNBC and NBC News say Hi guy\nSo David let me start with you um and uh and the markets the banks gave them a little bit of a breather today the major industries they were up but suffice it said it best couple of days they just kinda split up all over themselves\nYeah we've had a good run market wise drops that we saw this week we're startling to investors for sure um I think what you're seeing are investors reckoning with we kind of knew was coming that is the fed is going to raise interest rates Jay Powell to chair the fed has talked about that\nAre looking at the economic fundamentals you'd expect that would be coming soon some ... you saw folks process and that I think um you know there's some awareness to globally you mentioned the IMF we can talk about yeah morning here I'm Still a globalized economy and you know as the person ... talks about his latest triumph the the new NAFTA yeah\nWhatever it's called us and Europe um there's still a lot that needs to be All right out and there are plenty of investors plenty folks running companies are worried about how all this is going to shut down then\nShould we talk to me than about why everybody was surprised because Rosie insurance have been the ... everybody's been known it's coming and yet the past two days everybody just went oh my God that's\nThe mystery I mean everything that has made markets go crazy this week has been with us for so long I mean markets just completely shut off the trade war right in August\nAnd all this other stuff interest rates deficit everything and I think part of it is we know that this is going on for a really long time everyone is thinking you know there are we to complacent and I think that that's just\nYou know does the market and do something that the economy doesn't know which happens sometimes that totally you know I I think the theater and found it I think when we see Netflix and Amazon come out with ... in the next couple of weeks I think I you know who knows but I Would think\nMystery I mean everything that has made markets go crazy this week has been with us for so long I mean markets just completely shut off the trade war right in August\nAnd all this other stuff interest rates deficit everything and I think part of it is when we know that this is going on for a really long time everyone thinking you know there are way too complacent and I think that that's just\nYou know does the market know something that the economy doesn't know which happens sometimes totally you know I I think the theater and found it I think when we see Netflix and Amazon come out with earnings and and the next couple of weeks I think I you know who knows but I Would think\nThat ... everybody's going to go yeah I feel better yeah for now I'm a David the president's a chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow made one of his many parents was on the White House driveway yesterday said look you got an economic fundamentals are strong we've got grows going on\nAnd yet on maybe Monday or Tuesday I forget the international Monetary Fund came out and said hold the phone trade war terrorists were going to take our pick for global growth down a couple of nachos so there's a little disconnected\nYeah I'm In front and center here spend the U.S economy has been the Chinese economy as well all these global bankers economists are gathered in Bali for this big concept there ... all this stuff out at a right to reduce the forecast for us growth after\nChinese frozen in two thousand Nineteen um I think you're seeing that contrast that again we've seen for these many months now that you have\nWell respected economists saying they're going to be risks to what's happening here in you have members of some inspiration downplaying those risk it's interesting to the division between those advisors to the president President self we are talking about trade foul just a moment to go to the feds here you had the president earlier this week\nCasting doubt even answered reporters' question does he planned to fire Jay Powell I didn't know that we've gotten there yet it is a guy that he picked 'em so you have a president now watching these interest rates rise fair to say no president wants to see interest rates go up um but there exists still this division between the president those were to\nLeave that point about the the president ... told me on this program I don't care what the president says I'm gonna do my job but but there is something about um why it matters that presidents attacked the fed us all he's never happen but but this is real now\nIt really is and right he hasn't done this before and Jay Powell has actually managed to be relatively out of the limelight since ... since he took over\n'em but you know who knows I mean this could be here one day and on the next I mean we just don't know um rising interest rates you know it's a good sign this is only good thing it doesn't need to be you know it it doesn't need to be such a bad thing it's not crazy\n[laughter] it's like you're totally predictable do in the sense that this president has hitched his wagging to the store the markets from from day one\n... never happen but but this is real now\nIt really is and and write he hasn't done this before and Jay Powell has actually managed to be relatively out of the limelight since he since he took over\n'em but you know who knows I mean this could be here one day and on the next I mean we just don't know I'm raising interest rates you know it's a good sign this is only good thing it doesn't need to be you know it it doesn't need to be such a bad thing it's not crazy\n[laughter] it's like you totally predictable do in the sense that this president has hitched his wagging to the store the markets from from day one\nYou've now scene of a sizable downturn in the market this week and he's looking for an excuse someone to blame for that that seems entirely predictable into it so as well he's somebody who does that often right so seeing the market drop it points four percent whatever it is\nUh he's looking for somebody to blame this week I think it was ... and\nWe should point out here that the markets are back to where they were I don't you're not all that long ago I should have looked out the number of where I came in here but this is normal and to be expected and arguably a healthy thing in any market rally\nAnd it was a time and time again it's your monitor here the doubts about the economy is going to be caught me off the downright markets go up and markets go down under any easy showcase that time and time again that that ... unwillingness to engage with the fact that if it's going up up up up to go down at some point\nWe talked me for a minute about um ... we're going to get to this later in the program the trade war is still going on the Chinese and the United states still can't agree on on what to do about it there is a a ... effect that over time will take some of the air out of this cone\nOh absolutely I mean at one hundred percent and we'll start to see it next year\nOr this is big this is a big deal and this is now that the the the tariffs are with China has been vastly expanded in may be vastly expanded again uh this is this is dramatic and um it's actually amazing that it has an impact it the markets until now\nOr we're going to go back to a favorite of mine that
