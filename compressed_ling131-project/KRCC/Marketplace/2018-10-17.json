in two thousand seven\nWe are now dependent upon China and how do you get tough on your banker thing is\nChina's stockpile of treasury bonds is a very small fraction of the total us debt about five percent Mary Gallagher is the director of the center for Chinese studies at the University of Michigan I think\nThe notion of China as our banker is overblown both in terms of how much debt is actually owned and also whether or not their alternative buyers\nBut lots and lots of treasuries it hasn't actually been buying many more in recent years so the question is really would China dumped the U.S debt it owns as a weapon in the ongoing trade war you know flood the market with lots of bonds to try and mess with US Economy Gallagher thinks maybe anything is I think possible\nGiven the fact that the trade war is\nMore pointed then I think people initially expected\nBut selling off a bunch of treasuries would likely mean selling at a discount meaning losses for China a fire sale means that the\nBoss will be little wing will at UC Davis thinks China would have to be provoked to resort to that it's unlikely that the Chinese would use these option\nUnless the outraged by a lot
