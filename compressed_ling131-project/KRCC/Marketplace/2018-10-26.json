Michael Burger at the Saban Center for climate change law at Columbia University\nIt's a case that's about a company that told investors one thing but it was in fact doing something else\nExxon calls the allegations baseless at least nine cities and counties have sued fossil fuel companies to help defray the costs of adapting to climate change\nAnd then the lawsuit filed by Twenty one young Americans that could go to trial next week it alleges that the government should do more to protect Americans from the effects of fossil fuels\nThere's been an up tick in lawsuits like these in part because of improved scientific technique sets burger\nDemonstrated methodologies through which you can trace global greenhouse gas emissions to the fossil fuel companies\nThere's also been a proliferation of electronic documents that can reveal internal company communications Carol nothing with the center for international environmental law compares it to the internal documents that implicated tobacco companies\nMuch of the focus has been on you know a growing awareness of the difference between what these\nTobacco companies much of the focus has been on you know a growing awareness of the difference between what these companies knew and what they told the public what they told investors what they told regulators\nMoffett says these lawsuits are moving faster than the ones that caught up with big tobacco in New York I'm Janet Babin for market\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThere was a report out from American Express earlier this year the credit card people about the state of women owned businesses in this economy that had a whole lot of interesting data points that\nThe one that applies to this next interview is this women are starting on average Eighteen hundred and Twenty one businesses a day in this country and the reason we mentioned that right now is in service of this question\nWhere are these women making these kinds of deals and starting and running these new businesses one answer is in co working space it specifically women focused co working space as a company called the wing is one of them\nOrder Gilman is cofounder and CEO of ...\nThank you so give me the uh the virtual radio tour if you would if I Walk into a one of the wing locations in at like four in the afternoon what am I gonna see\nYou're going to the hundreds of women on their laptops\nWorking taking meetings on conference calls having coffee dates starting businesses at pretty extraordinary\nShows so these are not small little space is these are large\nA convening spaces I suppose in a sense right\nThat's correct um our our largest flagship and they sell her neighbor had it in our city is going to be twenty thousand square feet how\nYou're almost like a big box I mean that's crazy [laughter] we're still we're still we're still small maybe not maybe not ... but we have the plan will so let's talk about that a little bit give me first of all the the I guess the elevator pitch right I mean you've gone out and you've gotten vc funding you've been very successful at getting venture capitalists to invest in you and your vision\nWhat's the what's the what's the elevator pitch\nThe women's inspired by history rarely am and that the turn of the twentieth century in the late Nineteen century there were hundreds of women's clubs and so they were a huge part of the suffrage movement and the overall event men and women in this country but they kind of ...\nOf women's clubs and so they were a huge part of the suffrage movement in the overall advancement of women in this country but they kind of died out our idea was to resurrect them for modern women but you know the difference between when a hundred years ago and women today is that women today work\nTell me about your clientele would you your customers what do we know about them I mean you just introduced childcare right so clearly so more parents have small children\nYes um you know we have six thousand members of the wing and we survey them constantly\nAbout a quarter of them have kids and that's a growing population my cofounder Lauren I'm have a nine month old and watching her balance growing the wing and being a new mom has been an eye opening experience for me so yeah we're we're trying to always grow with our members\nAre making money it'd be profitable [laughter] come on the show got us a question\nIt listen where um the traction you know from tapping into needs that are that have not been addressed and I've really been neglected for women business owners um you know it's a it's the right thing to do and it's also um you know it it's a great business model\nLet me back you up for a minute to the venture capital part of this um you are a woman running a woman focused business\nVenture capital is neither of those things or what was what was that like for you going to wherever you went into ruin my little bark or wherever and making this pitch were were were ... she's were shut the well they were up there but I guess what was the reception you've got is the question\nYeah the statistics of how many women founded companies receive venture capital funding um are there really abysmal only about three percent of all I'm denser capital dollars go into business is founded by women as a woman going out to raise tens of millions of dollars\nIt's it's incredibly intimidating I'm it's intimidating to know the statistics of intimidating to walk into a room full of men in suits um around a boardroom table\nOur initial you know seed round was very challenging um just because there wasn't anything that had existed like this and we didn't have proof of concept yet um and there were frankly a lot of men who just said like\nI just don't get it you know I just don't get the product\nYou imagine do you foresee a day uh at I grant you that it feels like we're a long way from a no with me too and all that but do you foresee a day where I'm this company is not needed or your services are required anymore because society has progressed he\n[laughter] um you know I think that that's the goal and\nServices are required anymore because society has progressed\nUm you know I think that that's the goal in some ways you know [noise]\n... let's put it that way\nFor very young age she didn't even if it's not as overt as something like me to women learn to shrink themselves um Anton sort of pick up less space you know so we believe that they're getting these cues you know in big ways in small ways and that it's so important for space is like

Richardson from Edward Jones and Catherine Rampell from the Washington Post our in our studios in New York City everybody Hi chi chi chi so captain let me start with you uh and and uh in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a Tracey Samuelson in about a six minutes or so on some of the details of\nUh the GDP report as it deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report\nIt is a good number yeah\nThe headline number is good there are some underlying parts in it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had flowed you know there is this risk that the the ... to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the tank\nI had had slowed you know there is this risk that the boost to a capital expenditure is was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the ... and we're seeing it slow down so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number was good consumers seem happy\nMeal it it occurs me actually just thinking back to our open the show but I should have said that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the ... because there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the ... stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's boil it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger growth and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking in its good as Katherine said because the consumer is good I I hear some trepidation do when you're ...\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three persisting concerns\nSlower global growth higher interest rates and ... concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and said you'll see the push pull in the market\nBetween really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead okay\nKatherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears leaving them out will will ah [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and tariffs and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to billions of dollars into the United states because of all these jobs not mentioning that consumers are going to pay those jobs but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand it I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been like basically in the same breath ah you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he signed the tears don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about and\nA negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know when I've talked with\nA business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact\nThat Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nKnew what to do the right I'm from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's a goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed or ... or his biggest economic problem I'm even as a German ... told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with President says one does wonder if\nYou know with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer I'm In the fed might be thinking about rage what does this kind of pressure you suppose due to the ...\nWell you know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what that is really concerned about is how to keep the economic bull market running how they keep economic growth and and step one still normalizing policy because women as\nAnd we know that it will be a when a bench laid the neck and recession hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at is is fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession\nAnd they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero rain so\nAlong that path any political ... political realization of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart and his job all the more tricky and that's what I'm has to be negotiated going for a port\nRichardson a good we're Jones Catherine Rampell or the Washington Post on a ... I'm In ... don't you think ... thanks guys having this weekend on Wall street today down day that ended up and down weak and let me say one more time I think\nLike the fourth time as we said this this is normal this is what spoke up and markets go up\nTo go down but it has been a while some things have filters\nOne more time I think like the fourth time this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up they go down but it has been a while some things have felt this job and you write will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\nNah [noise]\nAre\nBack we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine and you'll and I were saying it's pretty lumber credit where credit's due\nBut you dig a little deeper as we want to do around here and you could start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drags last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster with the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent\nAt the end of you know is chief us economist at essence ...\nGlobal what you saw with experts down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shaped nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth but he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays\nThey may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from ten percent to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter to spend now and have it ready to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macroeconomic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which analyzed transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has edged out ... for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated that Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher fuel prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers that the impact of starting to bite\nThis is marketplace I'm tired result there's one gets filed street and see the I totally did not know that folder but you know the day that gets stored up in the cloud as the saying goes well it turns out all the big tech companies Amazon Google all the big ones they back up their cloud servers on magnetic tape\nIt seems so old school right but there is a problem and it's not what the tape just two companies make the tape that a big chunk of the Internet is backed up onto and each wants the other out of the business through and decker ... reporter from Bloomberg walk in the program\nYeah how are you doing today guy I'm well thank you are but I I I Will be completely honest and tell you that I read the story and I said they're still using tapes for cloud backup explained to me how this works\nIn the old school sometimes is that the storage on on a cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server but you know when you need long term archival storage you want something separated from the Internet and you want something that's going to uphold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in\nAnd the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because\nIt's cheap it's good it's it's reliable and its stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah and she was important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah at ... terabytes is equivalent to about a million books I'm right now a a single LTS seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes that's about Fifteen million books on one tape on one car crash okay now\nThere's a corporate store you're right there's ... and food you film or the makers of this tape that everybody now uses and we'll be using for awhile and they're sort of at loggerheads here explain what's going on\nSo there's a basic standardized technology that was developed by IBM H. P. and ... it's called the linear tape open\nThere used to be six manufacturers now there's two and those two have said oh you're using my patents in Latin it inventions and the other one says no you're using my patented inventions and each one has filed complaints at the international Trade Commission and here in Washington trying to shut the other one out of the U.S market\nTo catch them courses that if there is only one supplier of this tape and we're using it tobacco but basically everything that's an issue\nAnd that's the concern of the hardware companies\nThat if there's only one supplier of this tape and we're using it tobacco but basically everything that's an issue\nAnd that's the concern of hardware companies um they have filed some papers with the IT ceasing please don't shut either of them out or we want to have multiple suppliers\nUm both of them by the way our in Japan ... there are concerns about what happens if there's another earthquake what happens if there's not just an army that shuts down operations ...\nGive me the upshot of all these ah shoots encounter suits and decisions and whatnot we're dependent teams on backing up basically the entire Internet on on just two companies trip that that seems like a challenge\nIt it is there are some older versions of the tape but the hardware companies they want the newest version they develop the standard and she put ever more stuff on these tapes so the only ones and they would either have to pay higher prices for one or they would have to use these older tapes that have less data\nIt's so interesting because you hear people say oh it's up in the cloud all the time right and you think of this ephemeral thing but it's actually really tangible a physical product\nWill think about it I mean if you have software and there's a bug that's introduced into that software that bug will go on and on and on\nBut if there's a physical version of it on tape than that but doesn't touch the tape and that's how you can recreate it and and so you know I spoke to a number of people during the reporting and my story and they were all saying basically this is what keeps the world's running\nWow Susan Decker she's the patents a correspondent at a Bloomberg Susan thanks a lot of pressure to\nFrom the American pet products association comes to set up for this next story in two thousand Seventeen we that as Americans spend more than sixty nine billion dollars on our pets full disclosure part of that came from me about six billion of uh do give or take went for services like grooming and training which gets us\nTo the point to a series we do called my economy how people's personal economies are doing away from the big ...\n[noise] at marketplace that it was\n\n\n\nIt was all alone on the way out today in which market capitalization proves it's fleeting glory you remember month or two ago when apple became the first publicly traded company in the world to be valued at a trillion dollars and then like a week or something later Amazon was as well\nYeah well all your company's still were ten fingers take one step forward Amazon not so fast the company's troubles in the market the past month or so of cost the company the Jeff Bezos built more than two hundred billion dollars in market cap it's down to eight hundred billion now Jeff Bezos he's still doing fine\n[noise]\n\nMarketplaces supported by Donald ... service delivering fresh dinner catch that our table\nReading in the minute gobbled up to prep work so you spend less time shopping and more time with family\nLearned more at ... dot com slash market planes can biologic Craig bourbon handcrafted in small batches for a full flavored sipping experience forty seven percent alcohol by volume ...
