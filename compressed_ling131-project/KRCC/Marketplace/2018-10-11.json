market their market that can be catered to the content can be created for and from which profit can be made\nThe corporate example at hand is YouTube and its influence on the youngest of consumers Alexis Madrigal is a staff writer for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised by YouTube book on the program thanks for having me show talked about how you came to work on this story\nI have a two year old and a five year old vaccine toddler YouTube and I was like what are all these things all these brands I've never heard of these companies all over the world\nAnd I watch my daughter becoming totally absorbed in this kind of animation that to me looks kind of pre Pixar if you know what I mean\nOkay there's lots to unpack in there because the idea first of all of a toddler YouTube what what is that is it as it sounds so Derrick channels on YouTube that are built specifically for you know when you're old ... year old three year old is and that's what I call tied to YouTube and it's just kind of\nWild place well [laughter] I I almost don't even know what to say uh the premise here is that is that really young kids in this economy have tablets and phones and they're on them off almost as much as adults it kind of seems\nTo mean YouTube is by far the most popular brand among children and even little children have their own favorites to one of the biggest brands within the space is called to chew TV you know they have a Nineteen billion view is they have twenty nine million subscribers\nThis is a global children to entertain the kids love it they can't get enough they watch them over and over and over and over\nAll right so maybe I'm being naive here but I'm a you know back with the analogy you make in this piece is to PBS in public broadcasting in Sesame Street and children's television workshop from like fifty years ago now in in the American economy and the ostensible reason for all of that was\nIn Sesame Street and children's television workshop from like fifty years ago now in in the American economy and the ostensible reason for all that was to educate not necessarily want a two year olds but\nYou know slightly older toddlers and and give them a leg up is that the mission of of toddler YouTube and ... is that what they're doing\nYou know I think right now they're in a transitional place they banned entertainment they've been just trying to capture as much children's attention as they possibly can and now they realize that they've done that\nAnd they need to deliver them something better and so what I'm hoping is that this global phenomenon of all these video producer it's on YouTube will have a similar revelation and do similar work to create you know YouTube it's good for kids rather than just something that sucks up their time\nWill show spit bullet for me do you think that's going to work because you know not to make the American analogy on everything here but there were researchers and educators and and government regulators in some sense talking to the folks who are doing children's television workshop is there a sense that there's that infrastructure beneath what toddler YouTube's do\nNot really on the other hand they can benefit from you know fifty years of research on children's television but the media environment the media business there's obviously much different and the biggest differences there's just YouTube basically ... dishes where kids are going this is where the whole businesses\nAnd so YouTube itself would have to be the one that sort of maybe tip the scales for educational content within the algorithms that determine what people watch\nWhat do we know what do we think uh it's actually doing it the kids setting aside from it or whatever educational benefit they might have we know what being attached to our phones and our screens does to grownups what about the kids\nYoung kids well I think you know the the worst possible impact is that essentially that kind of attention grabbing fast paced content and the ability to switch between those things very quickly maybe sending kids up to expect a kind of pacing that's actually not educational\nAnd that's kind of the big worry that we sort of induce kind of attention a loss in kids\nAlexis ... writes for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised by you got to start really thinking
