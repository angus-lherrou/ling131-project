[noise]\n[noise] good days citizens and well into what Jefferson\nOur weekly opportunity to discuss current American events with President Thomas Jefferson who is seated across from you know a good day to you or a good day to you my do citizen\nMr Jefferson I have a question from one of your listeners are Randy Patrick ... comes from the state of Kansas or indeed was interested to talk to you know you you are responsible for\nThe existence of Kansas I ... is that overstating fish may\nBe a little I bought Kansas from the polling Bonaparte it was one of the eleventh states later carved out of the Louisiana Purchase\nHe wants to know looking at our nation from what you know about it during my time did free the slaves realize your greatest hope or your greatest fear for our country oh actually\nBoth ways I'm afraid to say that I knew that nothing was more certainly written and the book of fate\nThan that this people must and and would be free that we could not in the long run sustain the outrageous and abominable institution of slavery I Hope that the emancipation would come sooner\nRather than later I Hope that it would somehow happen in a benign way that wouldn't greatly disrupt the agricultural life of the south or create race riots or reprisals and so on\nBut I Will tell you this my biggest concern was not emancipation what what comes after\nEmancipation and I will say although I hesitate to say that I could not look with any ... um the\nAmounts of patient and I will say although I hesitate to say it that I could not look with any\nEquity muddy um the idea of a biracial republic in other words once we freed the slaves it seemed to me that we must\nA expatriate them from this country maybe repatriate them in Africa or find the homeland in the Caribbean or possibly a homeland and the American west but I did not believe that the two races after all that had had come between them could live in harmony that\nLooking at your a lifetime with the wisdom of historians during my time sure uh yeah I I can understand how they were as a single thread of your feelings about this issue throughout your life but in fact\nA if one looks at different periods of your life you handled differently as a young man you are quite outspoken but as you got older you seem to sort of ah put the issue aside\nWhile I hoped in the in the great idealistic flush of our revolution that we would simply figure this out and get it over with the free the slaves the numbers then we're not as great as they would later become\nA there was a greater possibility of social harmony if we decided that we needed to deport freed slaves or it was probably something that we could afford economically\nBut later in life I a couple of things first of all my fellow Virginians were a hundred percent against me every time I raise my voice about this I was made to pay for it\nAnd secondly\nAs I grew older I realized that this was so deeply rooted in American social economic and political life that it was going to take an extraordinary movement to rid ourselves of slavery and and I don't think I ever gave up\nBut I was waiting for the moment\nWhen I could really make a difference and I did not want to speak out about this\nIn a counter productive way and I felt that many of the things that I didn't say didn't advance the cause of freedom for a black slaves at all but but harden the spirit of the of the southerners who are never going to compromise on this issue a person\nWho is how do I say making harsh judgments about you Virginians that owned slaves would say well you know whether there were those who raised their voices against slavery and the Virginia ... did not\nI'll say this that there were many voices many\nThose who raised their voices against slavery and the Virginia ... did not\nI'll say this that there were many voices many of my friends believe that slavery was appalling\nMy daughter and my granddaughter's or I'm saddened\nDeeply saddened by the institution of slavery and wanted me to find some way to be a leader on this issue all I can say is that there were many many many things I wanted to do as a statesman the legislator at a politician\nAnd I felt that this was one that I was unlikely\nTo succeed in overtime I became less idealistic about it and even to a certain degree complacent about sway\nUnfortunate did lead to war in this nation I reckon in Eighteen Nineteen twenty and that a civil conflict racial is coming or\nThe separation between northern confederacy in some ways\nA difficult subject to discuss and I thank you for your\n\nSupport for Ninety One point five K.

R. P. S. F. M. eighty nine point\nNine a broadcast service member state university David going on these concert tour is is one of the joys of my life I always come back recharge you can hear it too so let's rejoined that performance right now one of the problems that we had to face\nWas how large country can you hold together and we were using very primitive infrastructure you know we had a ... a few little\nNational trails like the ... and the national road that went through Pennsylvania\nBut for the most part this was a\nA virgin confident the rivers had never been\nChannel eyes of the pilot never broken any of the grasses the trees have ever been caught was said during my time that a squirrel\nCould jump from tree limbs to tree limb all the way from the Chesapeake to the Missouri River\nAnd so this was just this vast primordial landscape and if Montana was\nDesert or semi arid\nFor me looking at this in my own time that seemed to be hundreds\nOf years in the future and so I didn't worry\nVery much about that that\nKind of brings us back again to the original purchase of the Louisiana Territory and that again in France they they they discovered they they come ... somewhat they claimed\nThey eventually gave it to Spain because they thought it was useless again what there is worse all was how are we going to you this land and and and um\nAgain in Spain a densely trades into France again and that sets off a chain of events because of that is something you did not know about a publicly although I started getting some Wilson\nAnd again and that sets off a chain of events because that is something you did not know about a publicly although I started getting some will some information about that and course Napoleon is at war\nWith in Europe and so this has office this chains of this now you were actually end up on that in in France for a while\nSeventeen eighty four to Seventeen Ninety nine I was a minister plan a potential route to the courts of of Europe and I joined Dr Franklin and John Adams there the foreign\n... time so he never got to\n... I saw the beginning I was one of the most fortunate enough men I participated in a small way on our own revolution\nAnd then I had the chance in Seventy and eighty seven to see a much greater revolution in Paris mean ours was benign revolution compared to the French Revolution and and as you know the French Revolution went into very destructive\nDirection eventually and and descended into a reign of terror and which ten or Fifteen thousand were\nBeheaded than\nThere were terrible street riots and a whole series of wars were born of this that didn't\nReally end until Eighteen Fifteen um\nBut when I was I left before all this really became chaotic and I was thrilled because I thought that the little flame that we lived on the fourth of July Seventeen Seventy six which really was the beginning of a whole new era in\nHuman history when the rights of man we're going to be understood for the first time I thought that little flame had jumped\nAcross the Atlantic and now it was going to engulf all of the tyranny of the old world and our revolution was going to be the spark that liberated the entire earth and so\nI was thrilled at first and then I saw towards the end of my time in France that it was turning into a very\nDark direction and here's here's the answer to that\nWere right we were ready for liberty because we were highly educated we were European derived from northern Europe from England\nWhen England had a long tradition of the magna car to the bill of rights and the the glorious rebellion and so on and so we were the inherit tours of a of a of the people that had already established liberty\nBut the French had never known liberty they'd only known despotism of the people were were terribly ignorant\nAnd if you expect to be an Asian ignorant and free you expect to have never has been than never can be in the history of the world\nSome of the people were were terribly ignorant and if you expect to be an Asian ignorant and free you expect to have never has been than never can be in the history of the world\nAnd so I felt that they weren't ready for our\nLevel of freedom that what they really need to do is go to an intermediary phase and then wait a generation or two and then moved to a greater\nLiberty and and eventually they would get to us but I haven't\nI have the stage there you can't impose democracy on other people they have to be able to create it out of their own value system\nAnd the polling it looked like he was more in the ah the market for conquer conquering the world\nAnd he was he was of the killer of the age you know ... ... exactly what I predicted what happened happened unfortunately but the revolution collapsed and the military dictator emerged out of it and he was a psychotic\nUm who wanted to control the world and he waged war against everybody and it took from Seventeen Ninety nine to Eighteen Fifteen to finally stop it and\nThat would be one thing if it were just\nThe old world but in the lead over into our world the French Revolution bled over into American caused enormous political chaos here\nAnd and that's kinda where we get into the meat of actually the purchase that happened\nUm 'cause\nThey they hadn't they'd just acquired again the Louisiana Territory from Spain they\nWell they they pull in Tokyo from Spain he just insisted that they see it\nBack to that there was a there was a kind of a one sided trade when they're not\nIt was called the treaty is on the phone so and he gave them the Spanish almost nothing until because he wanted the building a new empire he\nHit one of his plans was to start a New Orleans and then to to fill the Louisiana Territory with the French and if he had succeeded in Kansas would be a French speaking colony or French Republic we\nAh [noise]\nHowever and what may be hit save that was what happened in Haiti or what is now known as Haiti\nOr the French had a a colony there it was a very profitable sugar plantations but there was an uprising in their slaves slaves up rose\nUm really basically slaughtered enemies horribly horribly bloody to slaughter and you know they're they're a slave owners so Napoleon sends a one of the most powerful or monitors in the world and he was in the ...\nThere are a slave owners to Napoleon sends a one of the most to its power for monitors in the world and he was in the world to to Haiti he wants to eat and get basically using the word take it over and when you're done go ahead and head towards New Orleans and see what you can you there\nThe first thing he had to do is quell this rebellion and there was a the the conditions of slavery and the Caribbean were infinitely worse than here it's bad institution anywhere but\nThe conditions were appalling and they were working slaves to death and beating them to death and\nThere were disappearances and concentration camps and there was an unspeakable mess and finally if you push any people too hard too long they will finally rise up and so there was a black leader by the name of to solve a chore\nAnd he led the black Haitians against the colonial masters and Napoleon decided to\nQuell this rebellion and they sent his best troops um with his brother in law to to do this but when they got to Haiti son Domingo oh it was called than\nUh the diseases they're yellow fever and malaria and so on and we're so I'm horrible that they they killed off his troops but he lost the bulk of his best troops to disease and guerrilla warfare and so when this happened\nIt was a debacle that was expensive it was it was time consuming it it it it uh decimated his armed forces\nIt a disillusioned everyone who was in the field and so in the poll and finally said\nI'm done with the U.S just sell the territory to the Americans if we can and get something out of it and we'll revisit this after I can\nConquer Great Britain and Russia and this led to [laughter]\nAnd this led them to be a so enthusiastic about giving such a great deal to the Americans to get that Fifteen million dollar\nHe knew that if you know the war so when I became president and the polio and of course had already been done but there was the piece of mommy ends in Eighteen to and so there was a brief interlude where there was peace lasted until Eighteen five and this was a great boon to us because\nWe were just a simple little republic and we didn't want to be caught in this world we just wanted to be felt trees and create farms and to build a merchant marine and an end to end to gain some prosperity and to be drawn into that World War would have been just ruin us for us and so fortunately there was a three year\nMurray and and and and to enter gain some prosperity and to be drawn into that World War would have been just ruin us for us and so fortunately there was a three year peace well when you realize he was not going to be able to get to call this rebellion in Haiti\n\nNinety One point five cares DC is dedicated to covering southern

Tommy ever snow or in President Jefferson lived in Pittsburgh Kansas and clay you really good I Love doing other crazy for my own life and it's really fun to listen to it as such fun David\nI Love doing a fundraising programs for public radio stations and other entities around the country and it allows me to go see the heartland\nAnd you know ... you really you it is great fun to listen to let's go back to the show\nI'm not a Mason um\nI have friends who are masons George Washington was a Mason Mary whether Lewis was a Mason in fact or whether there was created the first methodical lodging the Louisiana Territory in St Louis when he was serving as the governor of up or Louisiana\nI had friends who are masons in every direction of I'm very fond of must sonic Laura and the sonic philosophy and the free masonry movement but I'm not a joiner\nDon't join organizations and I particularly don't joined exclusive organizations\nBecause they create social distinction and here in America\nWe're trying to create the conditions of equality and so I like the term from the French Revolution citizen\nYou know black or white or read male or female Jew or gentile or or a Unitarian what we share as Americans is\nBlack or white or read male or female Jew or gentile or or a Unitarian what we share as Americans is where citizens so we are citizens in which we call each other citizen\nThat expresses are equality I didn't like the terms ... Mr and Mrs master and s choir and Dr\nBecause they create these social distinctions which I think of damage to the European world almost beyond recognition and so I wanted us to find as many ways to be equal in America as we possibly could be and and every time I had a chance to join a secret organization I reluctantly said no\nJust because I did not want to help to create class distinctions we're so fortunate\nYou know in my time I don't know that this is true in yours we had the widest middle class world it ever known\nA tiny number of rich and and even tiny or number pour\nThe great mass of people were the middling condition and there was this brought equality here and where there is equality there will be human happiness\nJohn Adams ... close with us and then we're gonna have another little segment of this of this program so so please don't rush out unless you have to um\nAdams and I had been friends than we core old I'm over the French Revolution than a whole range of things that I supplied\nTo them as the president he was a one term president and he thought he should serve at least two and was upset when he was retired and blamed me in part on\nAnd he committed the greatest not been the history of transitions he left Washington city at four AM on the day of my inauguration on the public stage because he refused to stay to see me inaugurated in this place that was personally unkind\nBut it also was a violation of our system because in a republic when we transfer of power from one administration to the next and needs to be a sign of harmony in continuity and not just taste\nSo I never saw him again you know I didn't travel I I went back to mount a cello after my presidency and I never left its environments for the last Seventeen years of my life\nAnd Adams was up in brain tree Massachusetts and so we would have died on reconciled but our mutual friend of ours by the name of Dr Benjamin Rush decided that he wanted to reconcile us called us the north pole and the south pole of the American revolution\nAnd so he made a real campaign of this over several years and they finally convinced us to start writing to each other by telling each one of us\nThat the other was ready for reconciliation\nAnd so Adams broke\nStart writing to each other by telling each one of us\nThat the other was ready for reconciliation\nAnd so Adams broke the silence first on the first day of January Eighteen twelve with a ... little letter\nAnd I wrote back a careful little reply and then he wrote a slightly more effusive letter and I did too and and then suddenly this loose skates of our ancient affection opened and we became um deer correspondence and close friends\nOne of the things that we wrote about was aristocracy\nAn Adam said what think U. of aristocracy and I said I'm for\nNatural aristocracy but I'm against pseudo aristocracy\nNatural aristocracy is talent creativity wisdom intelligence good judgment artistic capacity\nThese people are born we don't all have it and when you find a natural aristocrat and by the way Alexander Hamilton was one when you find that natural or ... you want to nurture that person to lift that person into leadership positions in the arts and in politics and so on\nNot everyone can teach a college course we want our natural aristocrats to be those professors not everyone can paint we want our natural aristocrats to paint\nThe problem in culture has been that we've given authority to the pseudo aristocrats and these are people who are just born into privilege they don't have any particular merit often they have none\nAnd so the good nation is the one that takes\nAuthority away from the pseudo Eris the crowds and puts it instead of the natural aristocrats of course that's what a university like this one does is is to try to nurture young natural aristocrats you call it a meritocracy\nI'm for that or were born equal we have equal rights under the law but we're not equal and beauty and strength in character in artistic capacities or even intelligence and we need to lean on them best of ourselves the best minds\nBut the best and judgments we want our our leaders are senators are governors our presidents to be the very best exemplars of what it is to be an American\nAnd when we settle for anything less\nThan we make this difficult because a republic is a very fragile form of government\nThen we make this difficult because a republic is a very fragile form of government a republic only works if all of you in this room try to be your best self all of the time\nTo give a hard that is but you have to try to be your best self and to be civil and polite and tolerant and generous\nEven when you don't feel like it but if we all do that if we're all striving to be our best selves\nTo read to work from evidence to argue only those things we actually know something about um to give people the benefit of the doubt to to listen with respect to tolerate things that appear to be intolerable\nIf we will rise to our best selves and if we all list this culture together we might be a a thriving republic and there's one more piece that I Want to close with and that's agriculture while I Love about Kansas 'cause you have been a farm state\nHow many of you are actual farmers that's not good\nThey're like three farmers here [noise]\nI was told Kansas has this agrarian place we turn farming and soybeans and it turns out you're you're not farmers up I said in my only book\nNotes on Virginia those who labor and the earth of the chosen people of God if ever he had chosen people whose breath she has made his peculiar deposit for genuine and central virtue\nI Believe that a nation based on family farming is more likely to be virtually some happy and independent than any other form of a nation whatsoever so how many of you have some Jeannie a logical linked to a farm [noise]\nWell there you see\nYou're living on fumes [noise]\nI just started I just\nUrged the following two things since we're on a university campus number one I Want you all to grow up\nSomething in the next year or a tomato ...\nAsparagus a potato\nTomatoes are particularly important to me so I Want you to grow something even in a little pop\nA ... a potato\nTomatoes are particularly important to me so I Want you to grow something even a little pop because if you grow as you know if you grow something it deepens your connection to nature and natural law so how many of you will grow something in the next year\nWe should we should follow this up\nAnd secondly I Want you Walter considering learning ancient Greek [noise]\nIt is worth burning ancient Greek three at home or in the original\nIt and you might think I'm joking\nBut I'm not it is worth learning ancient Greek to return home or in the original and then you can read about happens in the fourth century and you will you will if you imagine if a year from now I came back and there were thirty Greek", "year":
