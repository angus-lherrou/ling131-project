lakes the size of Lake Huron that most people have never heard of that it is used to create one of the best agricultural productivity zones on our end we speak to Charlie Miller [noise]\nOne of the three authors of the third edition of ... water for a dry land tour Miller up I'm On a college along with John opiate kind of lying archer a book called a little olive water for a dry land which is about\nThis remarkable underground resource what it is a loud agriculturally and how it is now\nLiving on borrowed time because of its decline of a muscle resource and we wonder how Jefferson would have reacted to all of this drop drivers in the western Kansas or Oklahoma what does he say about the ... miracle\nSo join us for all that and more on this week's Thomas Jefferson\n[noise] good citizens and well why wouldn't jump pushing the opportunity to discuss current American events with\nPresident Thomas Jefferson who is seated across from you know good day to you Mr President the day to use Mr Jefferson's receive an inquiry from mark Kissinger he wants to know about water and\nAnd the federal government he talks about developing usable energy sources using pumped water which\nTechnologically maybe a bit beyond your time sure\nIndeed it is and let me say that I began to reject the proposition immediately when you talk about federal distribution of something like water\nWell he says these systems could be used to pump water from say water surplus watersheds into deficit watersheds to mitigate potentially damaging long term droughts no as a farmer yourself sure I I Can't imagine that you would be not in favor\nI certainly understand the problem but let me give you an example when I was becoming a young man in Virginia I noticed that the ... river a which went right past my boyhood home which had well was not suitable for moving grain to the James River into market\nAnd so I I took a canoe down the road bound to try to ascertain what its problems whereas a maverick will stream I made a catalog of those and realize that we could make it ... if we remove some obstructions and so on\nRather than going to the national government for this or to the British Government\nI went to my neighbors and ...\n... and so on rather than going to the national government for this or to the British Government\nI went to my neighbors and said let's take up a subscription and it says volunteers each put in a certain amount of money so that we can pay for the channel ... or the clearing of the obstructions in the ... river and we did it was done without any government activity of any sort it was done by the\nPeople who were most involved in that river of this wasn't done by people who lived on the ... river or on the uh Shenandoah River on the Potomac her on the Hudson River this was done by the people whose lives and economic fortunes\nWere dependent upon the ... we did it without any attempt to get a grant or to look to some outside entity particularly government to do this on our behalf and I I think that's the model that should that should be used it anytime that's practicable\nI understand Mr Jefferson we've talked of this before the ... must be must give Mr Kissinger he has his do and understand why he thinks this would be a good idea that the federal government is the only body that can really attempt these large scale public projects\nAre so having said that she could you explain to him in a little more detail why you think it's dangerous for the federal government to take charge of a project like this\nI Will say that the commerce clause of the constitution means that if let's say Maryland and Virginia are interested in the canal there may be some room for federal supervision of that because it involves interstate commerce and commerce is one of the enumerated powers of government\nSo you you're not constantly or you're not completely opposed you just think it should be done with great caution\nIndeed and that I'm a strict construction is my believe in radically limited government as you know even as president I called the national government the foreign department I Want the states to do everything that was a practical within their own portfolio\nSo I'm not against is necessarily but I Do think that any time you give a granted power to the federal government to do something like this\nThat increases ah the potency of the national government it creates a potential monster because when you grant these powers to government government than wants other\nCorollary powers it takes tax money to make this happen the central government grows at the expense of the state governments and at the expense of local governments\nCorollary powers that takes tax money to make this happen the central government grows up the expense of the state governments and the expense of local governments and even more important than the national government girls at the expense of local volunteer initiative and then suddenly everyone's looking to the national government to solve all of our problem and I understand the point\nI understand and I take your point at the same time Mr Jefferson being a farmer and you need good soil and you need water and if the federal government can in a big sense ensure that you have a supply of water I it's tough to understand why you would not want that to happen\nWell first of all America is a big country and most of it is a well water you don't need to make the word [noise] however if you do want to make the areas that Mr Lewis and the west of could only bloom with\nI Would hope the states would handle that and the government of the United states and we serve the referee thank you very much Mr personality or Muslim groups [noise]\n\nWhen folks come up and tell us to hurt us on the radio my first reaction is hey we should hang out in a way it's a filter and it puts us in contact with people that we would probably want to do business with and it's a very

engines pulling water from two hundred and fifty feet below the surface it was not Jeffersonian agriculture exactly but it was not exactly when they ... it was remarkable and we have the great good fortune to be able to talk this morning with my friend charm Miller\nOf promoting college and the co author of a book called ... water for a dry land three authors John obey jar Miller in ... archer good morning or\nGood morning ... good morning when I read your book I found something really remarkable pretty close to the beginning\nYou say you and your co authors say that while we normally think of irrigation projects in the west as involving massive dams and canals irrigation systems and a government funding at least by the state of Colorado but more often by the government of the United states\nWhat marks the ... irrigation system is a high level of individual isn't there is not a gigantic dam that supplies this water and government at least the national government has not played much of a role in this can can you explain that\nYeah it is actually the most striking thing and and I'm like like many of us who study the west and water [laughter] just sort of blew my mind\nBecause it's also one of the most extraordinarily managed landscapes it's not just the individuals who are doing the work like you mentioned in your opening um and in western Kansas or northern Texas or wherever but but any of us who have ever flown across the United states you look down and you can see\nThe upside down and rain what it's produced in the ... area and it's and and so in a sense it looks like the Central Valley of California 'cause it's agriculture and it's on a huge scale but the differences in Central Valley of California there every single river is damned coming out of the Sierras there are\nPumps and moving water ... ways that have been paid by the federal government pay by the state government that 'til they wouldn't accept local\nBut the ... just knocked me out in terms of the degree to which\nLocal but the ... just knocked me out in terms of the degree to which\nAlmost none of this activity is funded by the federal government and you know admittedly the ... named by a USGS um geologist um but other than that you don't see much federal presence\nSo you have tens of thousands of individual farmers\nPutting down wells and creating either drip irrigation systems or once in a while now flood irrigation systems this was done through cooperative arrangements and there is some oversight but for the most part each of these as an individual investment in prosperity\nIt has a it's an individual and gamble and prosperity also I'm as the Ogallala story unfolds in the book\nUm these folks are gambling with everything I mean whether they succeed or don't integrate gospel it's a dramatic example of the failures um that so many endured and the consequences that that flowed west as many moved to places like California to try to reclaim their lives\nUm but but it it's it's a it's a gamble that clearly farmers for a very long time have been willing to make not just because they pay off his great but because they fill up the place like western Kansas or or Nebraska\nI'm can't imagine life elsewhere and this is just the the the thing you have to endure\nIs not only of the weather\nAnd the brutal winters but but you get to you get to um work the land in a way that is not Jeffersonian and scale\nBut if we go back to your opening and think about the Jeffersonian model of individual farmers yes these are large corporate entities that some extent but many of the people that John did the initial interviews with one the first edition came out\nSeveral ... many years ago [noise]\nAnd these are folks who really you know put things together like the irrigation pipeline say put everything together or to produce really large scale but family controlled um enterprises\nSo a giant landscape in western Nebraska eastern Colorado and Wyoming in the panhandle of Texas and parts of Oklahoma New Mexico\nWould probably be able to produce some dryland wheat but maybe not every year but thanks to the ... of this has been one of the most productive farmland in North America\nI I Would argue one of the most productive ... farm lands on the world it's it's incredible\nThis has been one of the most productive farmland in North America\nI I Would argue one of the most productive ... farm lands on the world it's it's incredible\nWhen you think about California you think about the Colorado River and the Sacramento River is on\nWhenever the downside is that sort of irrigation and these are renewable resources and I think both exam I Want you really talk about now is how the owner Lola for all of its abundance of it's also like the size of maybe Lake Huron but it is not a sustainable form of agriculture\nIs not stable form and there is where the gamble really comes in not just in the periodic drought wipe out a particular year are set up your crops\nBut the fact that the ... has been so extraordinarily productive for now a century and let's say Twenty years or so but really not since World War two when gasoline driven pumps really change the way and the pay scale of the irrigation prophecies\nHum that that offer that extraordinary fertile awkward for with a fossil water\nUm is disappearing really quickly and at least and I don't think they're cynical I think many of the really smart sort of economic forecasts of this region indicates that they think that water is gone and twenty fifty in most cases other places have already lost it and they'd have to revert to dry land ...\nUm I think that's what we're going to see over the next thirty forty fifty years and many places as we try to um do a bridging process and move move much of this agriculture elsewhere\nBut it is also the depressing part of the story that human beings because of our technology that has unleashed such creativity has also unleash the capacity for us to destroy the very things that we were creating\n'em and as conservative as people might want to be with water um it's a little bit too late and part of it has to do with the ... as a structure as you noticed it's not just not sustainable in terms of how we're dealing with it it also doesn't regenerate at a speed that anybody can forecast or or watch\nIt I Will say like one or two inches per year regenerate yeah\nWhich is you might as well not regenerate um and actually the the the line that we use in the text or in the new book is that if you turned off every single ... if you turned off and every um flood irrigation\nJust a in a new book is that if you turned off every single spigot if you turned off and every um flood irrigation and drip irrigation [noise] uh no more water was pumped out of the aquifer at all it would take six thousand years to regenerate\nBut quality cost money at the nonprofit media organization we looked directly to you to help pay the cost of

are Mr Davis went from I think you have a question for our guests terminal or I\nDo first I Want to congratulate you on this third edition of of of the book or below water for a dry land thank you thank you and a is a fascinating read I Want to change the subject a little bit go away from water and talk about dirt\nAs soon as this there's this great section early in the book where you explained soils in what's perfect in the breakdown of the nutrients in how farmers during that period would recognize this perfect soil and the elements that it only took about Jefferson and the the red clay soil and Virginia\nRight right yeah and you know the language of ecological capital which I also love\n'em you know trying to think of ways that you can capture two things simultaneously that don't seem to go together I mean if you think about ecological or you don't tend to think about capital or capitalism but but in truth that is that is the thing that that turns\nThat soil hum a and as we write it turns it into a kind of miraculous balance of the chemicals and its faults and you know sodium and hydrated and all these other um [noise]\nI kind of miraculous balance of the chemicals and its faults and you know sodium of hydrated and all these other um [noise] ... elements I mean it's just\nIt's complex it's complex it's really complicated\nThese these farmers during that period they recognize that they understood as we know Jefferson did you don't Adams was a fanatic about making the best possible a manure a newer again he\nKnew or yeah right exactly yeah and I think that's I think that um I won't say it's a lost art but I think it is it\nWas an art totally it was an art for them to be able to see that\nAnd I think now that we know that you can mix chemicals and produce fertility not really soil but fertility um we don't look at land in the same way anyway I Know you know not having grown up a farm that that was not something that ever entered my mind um but but having worked on this project for a long enough\nYou begin to recognize that that that the concept the hubs husband then\nIt's a really interesting term um all of all of this sort of you know\nPatriarchal stuff aside you really are married to and trying to produce the kind of fertile ex um landscape it's going to whatever the crop is that you want to grow and and you you sustain it and I think those are concept that are [noise]\nUm well I think we think our technology will save us in ways that we also see the technology produces the very thing that destroys us\nAnd I wish we could see the salvation piece more clearly in a sustained way without having blinders on to what might happen if we don't do it right\nYou know I have some experience out there and in seems to me that the chemistry is is is far and away dominating the um the stewardship of the artistry of agriculture so if you go to the right agricultural cameras that person will say\nIf you put exceed on that field and why pesticide and Z fertilizer and and our water\nYou will produce a crime yes and yes the oil some senses the least important part of it now that's just the medium in which happens whether it's the chemicals that are drawing on the ... and they're even people out there who have tried to put chemistry\nIn the pumps themselves rather than a spray on the pesticides and herbicides with tractors\nThey've tried to put them into the into the ... the water fortunately that's\nRather than a spray on the pesticides and herbicides with tractors they've tried to put them into the into the ... the water fortunately that's mostly men um abandoned does a really really dangerous practice because those chemicals seat back down to the ... but I can remember going out with my father in law\nTo to move pipe\nAnd we would actually be um at the pumps and there would be to be a ... running a top torque oh with almost no muscling and he would say hand me that\nThat pliers and he would be shouting at the top of his lungs to me for feeling way and I will say oh God what did you say and so you have this idea that it's like I'm I'm a\nSeven forty seven plane landing yeah and ... and we're having these things and then we think\nWe're we're Jeffersonian farmers aren't we and you think well there's Herod oxide or right I mean they may be individuals buts were using were the apex of a gigantic petrochemical in industrial system that ... that to be a quote unquote Jeffersonian farms\nAnd and the scale as you said it was huge try and that's just one form of thousands in that area [noise] um and it has to be that big in part because you can't I mean because of a natural precipitation you chief you've got to have a lot of land to do the kind of work that you're that you hope to\nTell in some fashion but no it is the most corporate ties hum landscape I Would say in the end the biggest sense that is to say the the fusion of money and technology\nUm the agricultural science is I mean all of the land grant universities and the great plains fabulous institutions are predicated on teaching that it isn't the soil is simply a medium it is a means to an ad because we can ... we can amend it we can amend it to whatever we want it to be [noise]\nUm and then you've got all of the extraordinary hum combine and everything else that just frankly boggled my mind the size and scale and family and the sort of technological process sees that they are able to do and the degree to which they do it it's amazing but that is not what Jefferson had in mind\nNot quite so let me ask you a couple of a final questions first of all sure why did you write this book and why do you read issue this book\nThat's a great question so so and it and ... and John ... was the original soul author of the book John us now in his eighties um\nQuestion so so and it and it and John ... was the original soul author of the book John us now in his eighties um and he and Nebraska felt that this was a time\nFor a third edition probably the last one because it it so much has changed over the last Twenty years from the previous ones which came out and to John basically finished reading at Ninety nine and it came out in two thousand two thousand and one [noise]\nSo part of the ... what's changed is not only the globalized nature of this agriculture but the even more clear um expectation that the Ogallala this water for a dry land\nThe water is running out and the dryness of the land is going to increase and there were sort of this really interesting moment in which we John fought and the ... university Nebraska thought\nUm you know this is this is a good moment to bring it out but John's health is failing [noise] um and he felt he needed help um turn you know he called me and I said are you kidding I Love that book I Do anything to help bring that book about\nUm and then kind of laying archer who's at Angelo state is uh I'm I'm a wonderful young historian has written a beautiful book on the ... river and Texas athlete glorious piece of work\nI'm we wrote ... and you know part of what we did was to go from every one sentence after the next ... working tax reworking ideas and then\nBecause so much has happened over the last Twenty years since the second edition was to really build out an ad in updates and revising and thinking at well wait a second you know they have this argument Twenty years ago where are we now and lo and behold they're still having the same argument\nAnd not much has changed in that for me was both depressing hum and regulatory because it meant that all of these conservation districts and we write a lot about a lot of them because we felt that that was a mechanism\nBy which they could be saving themselves and their future generations life on these lands\nFor all of the good work that they're able to do there is also a I'm I'm a constraint economically people want to make their money and that does as much as they might cooperate um the water is the the most essential thing to this this productive enterprise [noise]\nSo we did a lot of reworking we talk we did a long chapter on ... T Boone Pickens who was trying to grab as much of the Ogallala in Texas as he could get his hands on he failed um but it in and of itself\nChapter on ... keep doing Pickens who was trying to grab as much of the ... in Texas as he could get his hands on key failed a but it it it of itself that's a whole nother story of who's trying to get this water and and for what purposes\nUm and so we were really excited to put all of that together and get a chance to tell the story one more time I'm In a way that was consistent with the world that we knew it to be and then adding questions or climate change\nBecause we know a lot more today than we did that in Twenty years ago about the impact of it and you know even as his book within its final stages production we're switching terms and\nBecause of new things coming out and we're trying to his costs to our own time as we could um rewrite to the last moment", "show_name": "Thomas Jefferson Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Colorado Springs", "day": "28"}
