meantime\nIt's not really a pretty picture people were either an unstable conditions there living with family members so might even be facing homelessness or they're living in sub par a housing conditions as they wait for years to find housing\nI'm curious if you can help us understand how the section eight voucher program works and um I Know it's a complicated program there are many different kinds but what what is it generally do\nYes so with the U.S section eight housing choice voucher system it allows for a person to seek housing through a privately owned property um and\nThe federal government will pay a subsidy to the section eight accepting landlord and the tenant will pay the difference are based on their income\nTell us about January Harris January\nHarris I'm live

when it comes to public housing and section eight housing I'm not quite positive if it's being exacerbated by gentrification my sense a through my reporting is that the housing authorities are\nWander highly underfunded um and that is not a partisan or something unique to this administration\nInto it can be difficult to find landlords who want to accept a section eight housing choice voucher

mostly white and in the city it's pretty much predominantly black\nSo there is concerned there will be more division because of the undoing of this rule because it's no longer mandated that you make an effort to try to integrate your communities\nThe president has said that the war on poverty is largely over a desire to reconcile with what you saw in St Louis\nYeah I'm not at all actually um when I was visiting various communities especially along north side\nPeople just pointing around saying hey look at this look at all these in the house is look at all these abandoned homes nobody is coming here and people are concerned about how they're going to make ends meet and that economic prowess and\nGrowth that Trump sees for America doesn't really reconcile with what I saw in much of the

I mean we were hearing was the year if the woman and everybody wants to run for office but\nThere's one is particularly driving women of color more specifically black women to run for office well I think it is um\nYou know this confluence of events that we are that we find ourselves in a black woman had been running and doing the work behind the scenes for generations and you're thinking back to like Fannie Lou Hamer and Barbara Jordan you know women had been a black woman had been in the trenches\nAnd now there is this new sense of urgency we're seeing the attempts and in many cases the actual reality of the roll back to the last fifty years of progress\nAnd we're seeing that you know black women are saying I Can't let this happen to my community so I'm going to step up and run and it is um that combined with\nUh the electorate realizing that you know over eighty percent of our elected officials across the country are white and male\nAnd that is you know by no means represents the diversity in this nation and the electorate is saying you know we need to have some different voices around the table\nAnd these black women are speaking to my issues are regardless of you know the fact that they're black or they can appeal to everybody and it has really been a great um catalyst for all of these women to run such strong primaries and you know we're really looking forward\nTo some great pickups on November sex so let's talk a little bit about that because there are some challenges specifically and we know politics is is like any other industry right there are challenges as

by the Democratic party as less viable because of who they are because they can't raise the money because they won't give them to support what is that about um I think that's exactly it ice higher heights was\nBorn out of the notion that we needed a space for black women a political home for black women and go into a car and I we knew from our experience that the the you know factors that make a black woman a viable candidate or not necessarily the same as our white counterparts\nAnd we know that by mobilizing our networks because that is what we do just you know to make life happen for so many of us\nAnd the volunteer effort and the word of mouth and then also be bringing our authentic selves or to the campaign trail has really been\nA a great factor in the successes so we've always looked at Kennedy to a walk in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm on bought and on Boston we look at what kind of a volunteer structure they have we look at\nA you know do they have enough money to reach their constituents we don't need you know the hundreds of millions of dollars that so many of\nThese races costs but do you have the baseline of what it's going to take for you to reach your target voters and do you have a solid campaign plan\nAnd you know are you in line with issues that we believe will make sure that black women in their communities and their families thrive\nWe should also note that Nineteen of the black women who are running for the house are challenging incumbents here now that could work to their favor or not depending on what we talked about which is funding what can\nYou know how often has the ability to raise money part of the viability of a candidate right because you mentioned you don't need hundreds and millions and millions of dollars but\nAre there

dollar just you know from the jump you know we we need our whole dollar if we're going to be competitive\nBut I think it is also a thinking through it's not just the the large checks but\nUh being able to mobilize our networks for those you know monthly five dollar contributions that add up over time\nAnd see those ah you know contributions as a strength because they're not just dollars but they're also voters and most likely volunteers and it's also a question of actually getting people to the polls I mean you can spend all the money you want and I think we saw that here in New York without a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nWho nobody thought you know this person was going to win and then she wins re ... people showed up at the polls how important is that\nFor black women candidates absolutely it is a ... that is the deciding factor we have to show up and show out at the polls\nTo make sure that our voices are heard make sure that we have voices around the decision making tables
