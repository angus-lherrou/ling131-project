years as the case makes its way through the process or allow the government to take your children to a government shelter\nLast week a report from Amnesty International citing US Customs and border

Boston\nPresident Trump says he'll send secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia after the disappearance an alleged murder of Saudi journalist ...\nOn October second because she'll be entered this\n... to Saudi Arabia after the disappearance and alleged murder of Saudi journalist ...\nOn October second 'cause she'll be entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey and hasn't been seen since\nAccording to reports Saudi officials allegedly tortured murdered and may have even dismembered the Washington Post columnist claims which the Saudis states strongly denies on friday reports of merge that Turkish authorities have audio and video recordings confirming that can show he was killed inside the Saudi consulate\nThose recordings have not yet been made public but now Saudi Arabia says Turkish officials can search their consulate meanwhile US Senators are pushing the Trump Administration to consider sanctions on the Saudi Government and business leaders are pulling out of a future economic conference being hosted by the kingdom\nSarah as these as a journalist covering human rights in the middle east Hi Sarah thank you so much for having me on\nSo if the Saudis have denied any involvement in the disappearance of ... and I'm so far that's been absent any proof as far as we know\nA there was just a breaking news alerts that they are now allowing Turkish investigators into the consulate what's your sense on what's that could mean yeah that\nCertainly an interesting development however really remains to be seen how cooperative as Saudi officials may be and we have\nHad 'em out that officials all that on the premise is once before but it was very tightly controlled started more of a curated fewer than an investigation keep in mind that the Saudis have had almost two weeks to make whatever preparations they might mean to you in order to ensure\nThat the ... investigation um wouldn't go favorably for them so it's perhaps a positive development by you know we should be definitely be skeptical whatever may arise from that visit\nSo of course President Trump of the world has been watching to see what the United States a reaction would be President Trump was on sixty minutes this weekend and he said that there would be quote severe punishment if the Saudis were found to be involved with ... disappearance\nWould you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed depends\nOn what the sanctions or give you an example they ordering military equipment\nEverybody in the world want to vote order Russia want her to China wanted it we wanted as we got it and we got all of it every bit of it\nThe question I have for you is what\nChina wanted it we wanted to we got it and we'll all of it every bit of it\nThe question I have for you is what kind of punishment are we talking about he's sort of talked around sanctions or or sanctions still on the table\nThat is definitely a matter of debate at this precise moment we've had some members of Congress saying that they would\nWant to go that far you know for the U.S that has such a strong and longstanding economic relationship with Saudi Arabia sanctions are treated sort of as\nThe ultimate boundary of of the possible it it's a red line for some people who tend to wanted to focus on a more incremental perhaps more cultural soft reprimand towards the Saudi Government whereas others\nSay that that is the only really effective way the only way to really convey the level of severity that they see in this case so I think on what everyone's really watching as the the threat that Saturday issued in response to some of these hands on which is threatening to raise the oil prices threatening to retaliate\nUm as far as their oil production goes so we'll we'll have to see 'em what risks our government is actually willing to take but oil um in weapons sale there certainly are you know the meat and potatoes the foundation of our relationship with Saudi Arabia\nAnd you did speak with ... earlier this year what did he tell you regarding the Saudi state and the Saudi\nCrown prince [noise] yeah absolutely I spoke with ... uh several times for a few pieces I was doing I'm On the escalating\nCrackdowns the the growing um suppression of all all types of free speech and free expression in the kingdom on ... on a really shared with me some of his concerns that I'm a well Saudi Arabia had never been a bastion of human rights are free speech\nUm there had been a little bit of latitude a little bit of space\nFor the press for academics and religious leaders to perhaps differ with the royal family to a degree within some\nUm you know pledge of loyalty to the Saudi royal family however under Mohammed bin Salman we saw an increasing pattern\nOf preemptive strikes the crown prince was locking up people who had not necessarily criticized him at all but he whom he just feared might object right before he gave women the right to drive for example he locked up a lot of the country's most\nI asked him at all but he whom he just feared\nMight object right before he gave women the right to drive for example he locked up a lot of\nThe country's most conservative clerics in order to sort of head off any conservative critique and then at the same time he was censoring 'em or arresting academics and intellectuals on a more liberal side sort of just demonstrating and need to completely control the narrative\nFrom the top down as far as his reforms in his reputation and Jamal as a journalist really felt like he could no longer practice his craft as a journalist with any integrity um many people are being asked to sign loyalty pledges\nHe was receiving increasing pressure from the government and um he grew really disheartened with the regime he loved Saudi Arabia\nHe really expressed a lot of regret that he had felt the need to leave his family and his job and many many colleagues behind but he told me you know Saudi Arabia deserves better and this crown prince\nMain market um one thing may market a bright future for Saudi Arabia but without freedom of speech and freedom of the press\nThat's a really hollow promise so with ... with a lot of regret and sadness Jamal left but he always hope to see a better day for Saudi Arabia he hoped to see the crown prince curb his\nRepressive policies or perhaps be replaced by I'm truly moderator liberalizing leadership and um I Know he would have loved to go back one day rejoined his his family and his people but um that was just never to be his fate it

I'm a current senior at Harvard College studying history and literature and studies of women's gender and sexuality Asian Americans are being used as a\nRacial wedge in a lot of ways either way of propping up against other people of color and utilizing the quote unquote model minority meant to perpetuate these ideas about who deserves to be in these institutions\nPersonally for equal treatment of all racist regardless of your race or ethnicity I think that people should be treated on the basis of merit and opportunity I think that\nSome anytime cause such a different kind of racial balancing positioning thing by necessity and usually in bowl turning away from people who were more merited and taking and people who are less qualified\nI truly believe that my admission file my application\nCould not have been as compelling as it ended up being for my admissions officer had I not been able to talk about my race you know really meaningful way along with my other identities as a child of immigrants as a first generation college student at someone who comes from a low income family it doesn't and justice to\nAll students including Asian Americans to try to portray us as if they are\nAmong the left I grew up around Princeton New Jersey area so um there are a lot of people there who are very academic and very obsessed with college and so I think that\nWhen when you have that kind of environment it really doesn't help when school at Harvard basically says you know throughout petition is not worth as much as another guy's application because it looks like you're trying to guard because\nIt seems like you're not worthy some characteristics that you know we can't change about ourselves and\nDon't think they're the person on the campus who can deny that they have benefited\nOne characteristic this you know we can't change better so I don't think they're the person on the campus deny that they have benefited\nFrom having a diverse student body and a diverse campus I think that in fact the conversation has evolved to actually be\nMore about how Harvard could be doing more for it's good to do better recruiting getting diversity within diversity and thinking about Asian Americans as being comprised of multiple\nEthnic groups including Southeast Asians and more recent immigrants and Pacific Islanders [noise]\nJoining me now to discuss the lawsuit

Natasha let's start with you or you're currently at Harvard University which is the person who's being sued in this case are you involved in this lawsuit in any way\nNo I'm not so tell us a little bit about how harbors policy admissions work where does race factor in if it factors in at\nAll [noise] so how has a whole lipstick admissions policy which means that the admissions office upset a whole host of factors when deciding whether to admit students\nUm this includes of course academics um but in addition to academics it's also looking at a particular um talents that a student might have outside of the academics like\nMusical talent um you know perhaps someone is a national you know has done some I'm pretty serious science I researched them they are also looking at athletics and you know manning the sports teams\nI'm of course the legacy that are part of this and race is one of these factors and so um and it's it when it's looking at race it's trying to ensure a in terms of\nParticularly under represented groups African American let let the you know Native American groups I'm kind of diverse uh make sure that those voices are part of the student body on campus to provide a diverse learning environment\nAnd and this you know this kind of holistic look is what I think gets a lot of under a lot of people's skins ought to people want to go to Harvard but um it's a it's a there's not one formula in which to get into Harvard and\nIt's a lot of under a lot of people's skins ought to people want to go to Harvard but um it's a it's a there's not one formula in which to get into Harvard and when you know one and twenty students was applying is getting in and it's really hard to make sense of you know there's nothing you can do to ensure a entree to Harvard\nWell of course but you mentioned on the under represented groups who did not mention Asian Americans or legacy students that I'm Wondering why that was not that I can see students or whatever I Want to be very clear that's a separate group altogether that sort of has a you know admissions officers really consider that\nYes so um they I'm again I'm not part of undergraduate admissions I teach graduate students um but what you know what the admissions office to say um which is true of most elite colleges is that they consider\nThe children of people who went to Harvard at some kind of affiliation get a kind of closer look they get an extra read and you know they do get a small leg up\nUm and um and uh in terms of Asian Americans um they're you know ... the university denies that they're they're giving their penalizing Asian Americans\nI'm In the admissions process and this you know I think that what the point is they're trying to do in this case is a tie this question of are Asian Americans penalized if he's if he writes\nTo our whites penalized speeds of the um underrepresented minorities um I should say that you know there's a compelling with the in the end of the law there is a compelling state interest to give a boost to underrepresented minorities for the first starting environment\nThe Congress is not true between you know when we're comparing Asian Americans to
